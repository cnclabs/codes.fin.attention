item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we specialize in the development and commercialization of autologous cellular therapies for soft tissue regeneration 
our two product candidates  which are directed at the aesthetic and dental markets  utilize our proprietary isolagen process 
our ability to operate profitably under our current business plan is largely contingent upon our success in obtaining regulatory approval to sell our products and upon our successful development of markets for our products and development of profitable manufacturing processes 
we may be required to obtain additional capital in the future to support these efforts or expand our operations 
no assurance can be given that we will be able to obtain such regulatory approvals  successfully develop the markets for our products or develop profitable manufacturing methods  or obtain such additional capital as we might need  either through equity or debt financing  on satisfactory terms or at all 
additionally  no assurance can be given that any such financing  if obtained  will be adequate to meet our ultimate capital needs and to support our growth 
if adequate capital cannot be obtained on satisfactory terms  our operations could be negatively impacted 
if we achieve growth in our operations in the next few years  such growth could place a strain on our management  administrative  operational and financial infrastructure 
we may find it necessary to hire additional management  financial  sales and marketing personnel to manage our expanding operations 
in addition  our ability to manage future operations and growth may require the continued improvement of operational  financial and management controls  reporting systems and procedures 
if we are unable to manage this growth effectively and successfully  our business  operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 
the focus of our efforts has been and will continue to be the development  testing and approval of the isolagen process  and research into other applications  as a result of which we are still considered to be a development stage enterprise 
we have  since  made the isolagen process available to physicians primarily in the united kingdom as a means of developing our marketing  sales and manufacturing processes 
revenue from the sale of treatments was approximately million for the year ended december  although our revenue has increased more than as compared to the prior year  we continue to generate negative gross margins  as discussed under results of operations comparison of years ending december  and at december   we had cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and available for sale investments of million  as compared to million at december  the causes of our decrease in cash  cash equivalents and available for sale investments are discussed under liquidity and capital resources 
we believe our existing capital resources are adequate to finance our operations until june   however  our long term viability is dependent upon successful operation of our business  which includes our ability to improve and or automate our manufacturing process  the approval of our products and the ability to raise additional debt and equity to meet our business objectives 
recent developments we are developing our lead product candidate for the correction and reduction of the normal effects of aging  such as wrinkles and nasolabial folds 
in march  we announced positive results of our first phase iii exploratory clinical trial for our lead product candidate 
in july  we announced the commencement of two pivotal phase iii trials  which were being conducted in two different geographic and demographic populations in the united states as two identical trials for the treatment of facial wrinkles 
these trials  which were concluded during the second half of  were randomized  double blind and placebo controlled and were conducted at various sites in the united states 
the trials  which were conducted simultaneously  each had in excess of subjects split evenly between the treatment group and the placebo group 
we announced on august  the results of our pivotal phase iii dermal studies 
the dermal studies met three of the four primary endpoints and achieved statistical significance when combined 
the studies primary endpoints were based on blinded physician visual assessment using a six point scale with a two point positive move required to meet the endpoint and subject assessment using a visual analog scale 
trial b of the study proved to be clinically and statistically significant with both the subject and physician assessment achieving positive results 
trial a results were mixed with only a positive assessment from the subjects 
in addition  there was a wide variance in results from site to site with a range of response rates from to  where a response represents the improvement of at least two points  on a six point scale  based on a visual assessment performed by the physician 
we believe that this range of outcomes suggests that results are dependent on  among other things  injection technique 
we conducted a post hoc statistical analysis and a thorough review of the results of the phase iii studies that suggested trial results were negatively impacted by two factors in addition to injection technique 
first  our statistical analysis included all subjects who were randomized to the study 
the statistical analysis did not exclude subjects who received neither our product nor placebo  these subjects were deemed to have failed the study 
second  our study population included a number of subjects with a baseline assessment of two of their wrinkles on the six point scale 
a two point improvement for these subjects would have required an assessment of zero on the six point scale 
after consultation with our clinical advisors familiar with utilizing the six point scale  we believe subjects with an initial assessment of two on the scale should have been excluded from participation in the studies because of investigator reluctance to make a final assessment of zero equivalent to no wrinkles at the endpoint 
our future protocols will exclude subjects with a baseline assessment of two 
we used the information derived from our post hoc statistical analysis and the input of our clinical advisors to develop a phase iii confirmatory study 
during the fourth quarter of  we submitted a protocol to the fda for a subject confirmatory study the results of which we intend to submit together with our previous studies to support a biological license approval bla filing in we are diligently working with the fda to secure special protocol assessment spa approval of this new phase iii confirmatory study and to resolve a number of issues relating to the commencement of the confirmatory study 
as part of this process  we believe we have made significant progress in addressing the fda s requests for information regarding chemistry manufacturing controls cmc data and process validation 
we intend to conduct the confirmatory study from our exton  pennsylvania facility 
we completed the construction of the exton manufacturing facility during the fourth quarter of and this facility is now validated for trial commencement 
during the fourth quarter of  we commenced preparations for our confirmatory study  including identifying and recruiting investigator sites and submission of the protocol to the fda 
we recently conducted an investigator meeting during which we provided injection and assessment training to participants 
we expect to complete training and site initiation by the end of the first quarter of this study will be conducted from our exton facility 
we completed a phase i clinical trial for our second product candidate  for the treatment of periodontal disease  in late in the second quarter of  we initiated a phase ii clinical trial for the cosmetic  or black triangle  application of this product candidate 
this phase ii clinical trial concluded during the second quarter of the analysis of the investigator and subject visual analog scale assessment demonstrated that the isolagen process was statistically superior to placebo at four months after treatment 
although results of the investigator and subject assessment demonstrated that the isolagen process was statistically superior to placebo  an analysis of objective linear measurements did not yield statistically significant results despite a positive change observed as a result of treatment with the isolagen process 
clinical advisors believe that current measurement techniques are not precise enough to accurately record the positive change 
we are investigating alternative measurement techniques to assess change in future trials 
on october   we announced that the board of directors had appointed susan ciallella to the position of interim chief executive officer 
ms 
ciallella s appointment followed the resignation of frank delape from the post of interim ceo 
on october   mr 
delape resigned from the board of directors and entered into a separation agreement with the company 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of pending litigation  including the class action and derivative action matters for which we are defendants  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements and part i  item  legal proceedings  set forth elsewhere in this report 
critical accounting policies the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
however  certain accounting policies and estimates are particularly important to the understanding of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management or can be materially affected by changes from period to period in economic factors or conditions that are outside the control of management 
as a result they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
in applying these policies  our management uses their judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates 
those estimates are based on our historical operations  our future business plans and projected financial results  the terms of existing contracts  our observance of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
the following discusses our significant accounting policies and estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue over the period the service is performed in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
in general  sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the isolagen process is administered to each patient using our recommended regimen of up to six injections 
due to the short shelf life  each injection is cultured on an as needed basis and shipped prior to the individual injection being administered by the physician 
we believe each injection has stand alone value to the patient 
we invoice the attending physician upon that physician submitting his or her patient s tissue sample to us  as a result of which the contractual arrangement is between us and the medical professional 
the amount invoiced varies directly with the number of injections requested 
generally  orders are paid in advance by the physician prior to the first injection 
there is no performance provision under any arrangement with any physician  and there is no right to refund or returns for unused injections 
as a result  we believe that the requirements of sab are met as each injection is shipped  as the risk of loss transfers to the physician at that time  the fee is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
advance payments are deferred until shipment 
the amount of the revenue deferred represents the fair value of the remaining undelivered injections measured in accordance with emerging issues task force issue eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  which addresses the issue of accounting for arrangements that involve the delivery of multiple products or services 
should the physician discontinue the regimen prematurely all remaining deferred revenue is recognized 
revenue from licenses and other upfront fees are recognized on a ratable basis over the term of the respective agreement 
we also offer a service whereby we store a patient s cells for later use in the preparation of injections 
in accordance with eitf  the fees charged for this service is recognized as revenue ratably over the length of the storage agreement 
cost of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses the primary purpose of our houston  texas and to a large degree our exton  pennsylvania facility is to conduct research on the development  testing and approval of the isolagen process 
our london facility was engaged in the commercialization of our process for which they earned revenue from the sale of isolagen process injections as a means aimed at improving manufacturing technologies that are more automated and therefore would be used to produce commercial quantities of injections on a profitable basis in the future 
therefore  we classify as cost of sales the costs except for costs related to marketing  sales and general corporate administration incurred in operating our london facility and our previous australian facility as cost of sales  while the costs incurred in operating our houston  texas and exton  pennsylvania facilities except for costs related to general corporate administration are classified as research and development expenses 
costs of sales includes salaries and benefits  costs paid to third party contractors to develop and manufacture drug materials and delivery devices  inventory used in the manufacturing process  a portion of facilities cost and other indirect manufacturing costs 
those costs  except for the costs of raw materials that have not been used  are expensed as incurred 
as discussed under business our solution  historically  autologous cell companies have been hampered by manufacturing technologies that use traditional methodology for culturing cells through the utilization of plastic flasks 
this methodology is labor intensive  slow  involves many sterile interventions and is costly 
the use of this process to produce isolagen process injections in commercial quantities would not  over time  be profitable 
we have been using the commercialization of our process as a means of researching and developing manufacturing technologies that would be more automated and therefore could be used to produce commercial quantities of injections on a profitable basis 
through the end of our cost of sales has exceeded our revenue 
this reflects the fact that the level of our sales from our commercialization efforts primarily in the united kingdom  while increasing  have not yet reached the levels necessary for profitable operations  and the development and implementation of improved and or automated processes has not yet achieved all of the cost efficiencies we hope to achieve in the future 
if  in the future  the purposes for which we operate our exton  pennsylvania  houston  texas  or london facilities  or any other facilities or new facilities we open  changes  the allocation of the costs incurred in operating that facility between cost of sales and research and development expenses could change to reflect such operational changes 
research and development expenses research and development costs are expensed as incurred and include salaries and benefits  costs paid to third party contractors to perform research  conduct clinical trials  develop and manufacture drug materials and delivery devices  and a portion of facilities cost 
clinical trial costs are a significant component of research and development expenses and include costs associated with third party contractors 
invoicing from third party contractors for services performed can lag several months 
we accrue the costs of services rendered in connection with third party contractor activities based on our estimate of management fees  site management and monitoring costs and data management costs 
actual clinical trial costs may differ from estimated clinical trial costs and are adjusted for in the period in which they become known 
stock based compensation the acceleration of unvested employee and director stock options and forthcoming changes in stock based compensation accounting we account for our stock based compensation under the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation 
under sfas no 
 we are permitted to either record expenses for stock options and other employee compensation plans based on their fair value at the date of grant or to continue to apply the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
accounting for stock issued to employees  apb no 
 and recognize compensation expense  if any  based on the intrinsic value of the equity instrument at the measurement date 
any such compensation cost is charged to expense on a straight line basis over the periods the options vest 
to the extent we previously had cashless exercise provisions  we utilized variable accounting 
we have elected to continue following the provisions of apb no 
through december  stock options issued to other than employees or directors are recorded on the basis of their fair value as required by sfas no 
during december  the board of directors approved the full vesting of all unvested  outstanding stock options issued to current employees and directors 
the board decided to take this action the acceleration event in anticipation of the adoption of sfas no 
revised  share based payments discussed further below 
as a result of this acceleration event  approximately million stock options were vested that would have otherwise vested during and later periods 
at the time of the acceleration event  the unamortized grant date fair value of the affected options was approximately million for sfas no 
and sfas no 
pro forma disclosure purposes  which has been charged to pro forma expense in the fourth quarter of see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
substantially all of the unvested employee stock options that were subject to the acceleration event had exercise prices above market price of our common stock at the time the board approved the acceleration event 
however  because  as discussed below  we will have to adopt sfas no 
revised effective january   if we had not completed this acceleration event in december  the majority of the million amount discussed above would have been charged against the future results of operations  as reported in the statements of operations  beginning in the first quarter of fiscal and continuing through later periods as the options vested 
as discussed above  substantially all of the unvested employee stock options which were accelerated had exercise prices above market price at the time of acceleration 
for the purposes of applying apb no 
to such stock options in the statement of operations for the year ended december   the acceleration event was treated as the acceleration of the vesting of employee and director options that otherwise would have vested as originally scheduled  and accordingly was not a modification requiring the remeasurement of the intrinsic value of the options  or the application of variable option accounting  under apb no 
for stock options that had exercise prices below market price at the time of acceleration and that would not have vested originally  a charge of approximately  was recorded in the statement of operations for the year ended december  in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment  which eliminates the use of apb opinion no 
and will require us to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the reward the requisite service period 
no compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render the requisite service 
the grant date fair value of employee share options and similar instruments will be estimated using option pricing models adjusted for the unique characteristics of those instruments 
sfas no 
revised is effective for the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after december  the quarter beginning january  for the company and must be applied to all options granted or modified after its effective date and also to recognize the cost associated with the portion of any option awards made before its effective date for which the associated service has not been rendered as of its effective date 
we will adopt sfas no 
revised using a modified version of prospective application  or modified prospective application 
under modified prospective application  sfas no 
revised applies to new awards and to awards modified  repurchased  or cancelled after the required effective date 
additionally  compensation cost for the portion of awards for which the requisite service has not been rendered that are outstanding as of the required effective date shall be recognized as the requisite service is rendered on or after the required effective date 
the compensation cost for that portion of awards shall be based on the grant date fair value of those awards as calculated for either recognition or pro forma disclosures under statement however  as we accelerated the vesting of outstanding employee and director stock options during december  there is no remaining expense related to such options to be expensed in future periods 
as such  the impact of sfas no 
revised on our future financial statements will be based upon the number of stock based payments awarded in the future  requisite service requirements and the value of such awards on the award dates  factors which are not currently estimable 
we anticipate utilizing the black scholes valuation model in order to value future stock option awards  and anticipate utilizing the binomial lattice model when considered by management to be more appropriate 
federal securities and derivative actions as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements and part i  item  legal proceedings  set forth elsewhere in this report  we are currently defending ourselves against various class and derivative actions 
we intend to defend ourselves vigorously against these actions 
we cannot currently estimate the amount of loss  if any  that may result from the resolution of these actions  and no provision has been recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
generally  a loss must be both reasonably estimable and probable in order to record a provision for loss 
we will expense our legal costs as they are incurred and will record any insurance recoveries on such legal costs in the period the recoveries are received 
although we have not recorded a provision for loss regarding these matters  a loss could occur in a future period 
we are involved in various other legal matters that are being defended and handled in the ordinary course of business 
although it is not possible to predict the outcome of these matters  management believes that the results will not have a material impact on our financial statements 
results of operations comparison of years ending december  and revenue 
revenue increased million  to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in revenue is primarily attributable to the continuation of the level of operations in the united kingdom achieved in the second half of  as approximately of revenue was earned during the last six months of however  the increase in revenue was less than management anticipated 
in terms of product volumes as measured by milliliter of product  volumes increased by approximately during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  average selling price per milliliter of treatment decreased approximately during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  the average selling price has fluctuated as we continue to investigate various price points in the united kingdom market 
in addition  our average selling price per milliliter has declined due to the increase in four and six milliliter treatment programs sold during the year ended as compared to primarily three milliliter treatments sold during the year ended generally  higher milliliter treatments have a higher selling price than lower milliliter treatments  however  the average price per milliliter decreases 
in addition  after the completion of a standard treatment  a patient may request and pay for an additional milliliter of treatment 
such additional treatment volumes increased by approximately during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  this increase in volume was offset by a decrease in average selling price of approximately 
the revenue which we recognized during the year ended december  and was in part reduced by the effects of promotional incentives provided to doctors utilizing the isolagen process 
from time to time  we provide promotional incentives  or no charge treatments  to doctors utilizing the isolagen process 
such promotional incentives are not reflected as revenue  but rather  are reflected as marketing expense in selling  general and administrative expenses 
we expect to continue  on a reduced basis in  providing such promotional incentives to doctors during the introduction phase of the isolagen process in the united kingdom and elsewhere 
we also offer a service whereby we store a patient s cells for later use in the preparation of injections 
the fees charged for this service are recognized as revenue ratably over the length of the storage agreement 
revenue from this service in the year ended december  and was less than million and less than million  respectively 
additionally  we offer a service whereby we process a patient s cells to expand the cells to the mass necessary to prepare an injection  but then store the expanded cells for later use in the preparation of injections 
revenue from this service  since our inception  is less than million 
overall we believe our revenue  as compared to anticipated revenue  was adversely affected by the following factors our sales remained heavily concentrated in the united kingdom 
we envisioned a much greater geographical reach 
our marketing efforts in the united kingdom were curtailed by marketing restrictions 
we were unable to effectively and efficiently implement manufacturing process and technology improvements in the united kingdom which led to a high variable cost base and negative margins during the period of implementation of these improvements 
as a result  we dedicated less resources toward market development 
at the time of our initial projections  we assumed a positive bla submission during as a result of our trial results and our inability to file the bla  we dedicated less resources than we previously anticipated towards market development 
cost of sales 
costs of sales increased to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of million in cost of sales is primarily related to the increase in sales 
the increase in cost of sales resulted from increases in essentially all categories of costs as the united kingdom operation increased its commercialization of our process 
during the year ended december   we continued to increase manufacturing headcount and related overhead costs commensurate with demand 
for the year ended december   our cost of sales exceeded revenue as the development and implementation of improved manufacturing processes has not yet achieved all of the cost efficiencies we anticipate 
as a percentage of revenue  cost of sales were approximately for the year ended december  and approximately for the year ended december  the change in this percentage is the result of the lower level of sales activity during  our early stage of commercial development and the associated lower level of operational activity 
as product volumes have increased  our fixed costs have been spread over a greater number of units  thereby lowering cost of sales as a percentage of revenue 
in addition  as a result of certain manufacturing initiatives  we have experienced improvements regarding the quantity of certain materials utilized in our manufacturing process  thereby lowering our cost of sale as a percentage of revenue 
as previously discussed  we have been using the commercialization of the isolagen process in the uk market as a means aimed at improving and or automating our manufacturing process  which would be used to produce commercial quantities of injections on a profitable basis in the future 
as the london facility operations continue to develop and mature  resulting in significant changes to its stage of commercial development  large fluctuations in the percentage of cost of sales to revenue are anticipated 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased approximately million  or  to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in selling  general and administrative expense is primarily due to the following a other general and administrative costs increased by approximately million to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december   due primarily to increased facility occupancy costs of million  increased accounting fees of million  increased insurance and office costs of million and increased general costs related to increasing headcount and higher overall business activity of million 
further  a million impairment charge related to certain third party developed software costs was recorded during the year ended december  as such software was taken out of service and not expected to provide future value 
b promotional expense increased by approximately million to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for year ended december  due to increased marketing and promotional efforts related to the efforts to expand our operations in the united kingdom and increase our revenue 
c legal expenses increased approximately million to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december   due primarily to costs related to the securities and derivative lawsuits  for which we are defendants  and employment termination matters 
d salaries and compensation increased by approximately million to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for year ended december   due to an increase in the number of our employees 
this increase in the number of employees was offset by decrease in severance expenses during of million 
we incurred million of severance expense in the year ended december   as compared to million in the year ended december  e travel expense increased by approximately million to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for year ended december   due primarily to increased travel between our houston  texas and exton  pennsylvania locations as compared to the prior year 
f consulting expense decreased by approximately million to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  for the year ended december   the consulting costs included million of stock based expenses related to options and warrants issued under consulting and distribution agreements and million of stock compensation related to stock options issued to directors 
during the year ended december   there was approximately million of stock based expense 
the level of the expense recorded for the warrants issued under consulting and distribution contracts varies from quarter to quarter based on changes in the market price of our common stock  and the negative expense in reflects the effects of the decline in the price of our common stock 
the decrease in stock based expenses of million  discussed above  was offset by an increase of million related to increase recruiting costs  general consulting expenses and investor relations costs during research and development 
research and development expenses increased by approximately million during the year ended december  to million  as compared to million in the year ended december  research and development costs are composed primarily of costs related to our efforts to gain fda approval for the isolagen process for specific dermal applications in the united states and also include costs to develop more automated manufacturing  cell collection and logistical process improvements 
our initial pivotal phase iii dermal studies and our phase ii dental studies concluded during the first half of we subsequently commenced preparations for a confirmatory phase iii dermal trial during the fourth quarter of such costs include personnel and laboratory costs related to these fda trials and certain consulting costs 
the total inception to date cost of research and development as of december  was million 
the fda approval process is extremely complicated and is dependent upon our study protocols and the results of our studies 
in the event that the fda requires additional studies for dermal applications or requires changes in our study protocols or in the event that the results of the studies are not consistent with our expectations  as occurred during with respect to our pivotal phase iii dermal trial see the recent developments section  the process will be more expensive and time consuming 
due to the complexities of the fda approval process  we are unable to predict what the cost of obtaining approval for the dermal applications will be at this time 
also  during the third quarter of  we began an investigational study related to patients subjectively considered to be poor responders to the isolagen process or the suboptimal program 
approximately patients are ultimately expected to be included in the suboptimal program and the program is expected to be completed during the first half of at an estimated total cost ranging from million to million 
we have other research projects currently underway 
however  research and development costs related to these projects were not material during and the major changes in research and development expense are due primarily to the following a consulting expense increased by approximately million to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december   as a result of increased expenditures related to our clinical trials and automated manufacturing research and development  b salaries and payroll taxes increased by approximately million to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december   as a result of increased employees engaged in research and development activities and c facility costs  including rent  utilities and other related costs  increased approximately million  due primarily to the new exton  pennsylvania lease which commenced during interest income 
interest income increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in interest income of million resulted principally from an increase in the amount of cash held in interest bearing accounts  and our investment in marketable debt securities  due to the investment of the proceeds from the issuance of million of convertible subordinated debt in the fourth quarter of  as well as an increase in interest rates over the comparable period 
we expect our interest income to decrease in as we continue to utilize our cash and available for sale investments to fund operations and capital expenditures 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in interest expense of million is related to the interest expense associated with the issuance on november  of million in principal amount of convertible subordinated notes  as well as the related amortization of deferred debt issuance costs of million for the year ended december  our notes were outstanding for approximately two months in  as compared to outstanding for the full year in net loss 
net loss for the year ended december  was million as compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  this increase in net loss of million represents the effects of the increases in selling  general and administrative expenses  research and development expenses and interest expense  partially offset by the increase in our interest income and improvement in gross margin 
as a result of declining foreign currency exchange rates since december   specifically the exchange rate between the us dollar and the british pound and the swiss franc  our accumulated other comprehensive income of million at december  has decreased to an accumulated other comprehensive loss of million at december   or a change of million 
however  this loss is considered unrealized and is reflected on the consolidated balance sheet 
accordingly  this unrealized loss may increase or decrease in the future  based on the movement of foreign currency exchange rates  but will not have an impact on net income loss until the related foreign capital investments are sold or otherwise realized 
results of operations comparison of years ending december  and revenue 
revenue increased or million  to million for year ended december   from million in the prior year 
the increase in revenue is primarily attributable to the continuation of operations in the united kingdom 
the revenue which we did recognize during the years ended december  and from our united kingdom operations was in part reduced by the effects of promotional incentives provided to doctors utilizing the isolagen process 
we also offer a service whereby we store a patient s cells for later use in the preparation of injections 
the fees charged for this service are recognized as revenue ratably over the length of the storage agreement 
we also provide a service whereby we processes a patient s cells to expand the cells to the mass necessary to prepare an injection  but then store the expanded cells for later use in the preparation of injections 
revenue from these services was less than million in and zero in cost of sales 
costs of sales increased  or million  to million during the year ended december   from million in the prior year 
the increase in cost of sales was primarily related to the increase in activities of our london and australia facilities 
the increase resulted from increases in essentially all categories of costs as these facilities increased their commercialization of our process 
cost of sales exceeded revenue as the development and implementation of automated processes had not yet achieved all of the cost efficiencies we hope to achieve in the future 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased  or million  to million for the year ended december   from million in the prior year 
the major components of the approximate million increase in selling  general and administrative expense are as follows a salaries increased by approximately million to million for the year ended december   as compared to million in the prior year  due to an increase in our number of employees 
the expense for year ended december  included million related to employee severances 
of this million  million results from the severance of two employees who are entitled  under their contracts  to receive salary payments through july and million results from our decision to close our facility in australia and serve the australian market through our existing facility in europe see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the year ended december  expense included an imputed expense of million for the fair market value of services provided by certain officers for which they will not be compensated 
b office and other costs increased by approximately million to million for the year ended december   as compared to million in the prior year  which increase is primarily related to the commencement of our operations in the united kingdom and the completion of our us laboratory in texas 
there was a million loss on disposal of an asset  primarily consisting of assets in australia  for the year ended december  there was a million loss on disposal of an asset  primarily consisting of the write off of software in the prior year 
c consulting expense increased by approximately million to million for the year ended december   as compared to million in the prior year 
the increase included million of stock based expenses related to options and warrants issued under consulting and distribution agreements  and million of stock compensation related to stock options issued to directors and officers 
there was a million stock based expense in the prior year 
the level of the expense recorded for the warrants issued under consulting and distribution contracts can vary from quarter to quarter based on changes in the market price of our common stock 
d promotional expense increased by approximately million to million for the year ended december  compared to million to the year ended december due to increased marketing and promotional efforts related to the expansion of our operations in the united kingdom 
e depreciation and amortization increased by approximately million to million for the year ended december   as compared to million in the prior year  which increase was based on assets placed into service during with the commencement of our operations in the united kingdom and the completion of our us laboratory 
f travel expense increased by approximately million to million for the year ended december   as compared to million in the prior year 
g legal expense increased by approximately million to million for the year ended december   as compared to million in the prior year 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased by approximately million during the year ended december   to million from million in the prior year 
research and development costs are composed primarily of costs related to our efforts to gain fda approval for our products in the united states 
these costs include those personnel and laboratory costs related to the current fda trials and certain consulting costs 
the total cumulative cost of research and development incurred through december  was million 
the fda approval process is extremely complicated and is dependent upon our study protocols and the results of our studies 
in the event that the fda requires additional studies for dermal applications or requires changes in our study protocols or in the event that the results of the studies are not consistent with our expectations the process will be more expensive and time consuming 
due to the complexities of the fda approval process we are unable to predict what the cost of obtaining approval for the initial dermal applications will be 
we have other research projects currently underway 
however  research and development costs related to these projects were not material during the or periods 
the major components of the approximately million increase in research and development expense were as follows a consulting expense increased by approximately million to million during the year ended december   as compared to million in the prior year  b salaries and payroll taxes increased by approximately million to million during the year ended december   as compared to million in the prior year  and c laboratory expense decreased by approximately million to million during the year ended december   as compared to million in the prior year 
interest income 
interest income increased  or million  to million during the year ended december   from  in the prior year 
the increase in interest income resulted principally from an increase in the amount of cash held in interest bearing accounts  and our investment in marketable debt securities  as the result of our receipt of the proceeds of million from the issuance of common stock in the second quarter of and the issuance of million of convertible subordinated notes in the fourth quarter of interest expense 
interest expense increased million  to million during the year ended december   from in the prior year 
the increase in interest expense resulted principally from the issuance of million in principal amount of convertible subordinated notes 
net loss 
net loss for the year ended december  was million  as compared to a net loss of million in the prior year 
this increase in net loss is attributed primarily to the increases in our selling  general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses discussed above 
we compute our net loss per share on the basis of net loss attributable to common shareholders  which included the effects of certain items not included in the determination of net income 
net loss attributable to common shareholders for the year ended december  was million as compared to a net loss attributable to common shareholders of million in the prior year 
these amounts include million of deemed dividend associated with beneficial conversion of preferred stock in and include million of preferred stock dividends in liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by used in operating  investing and financing activities for the three years ended december  were as follows year ended december  in millions cash flows from operating activities cash flows from investing activities cash flows from financing activities operating activities 
cash used in operating activities during the year ended december  amounted to million  an increase of million over the year ended december  the increase in our cash used in operating activities over the prior year is primarily due to an increase in net losses adjusted for non cash items of  with the balance of million attributable to our changes in operating assets and liabilities 
our negative operating cash flows in were funded from cash on hand at december  and the net proceeds from the liquidation of available for sale investments held at december   both of which we derived from the proceeds of our issuances of common stock and convertible subordinated notes 
investing activities 
cash provided by investing activities during the year ended december  amounted to million  an increase of million over the year ended december  outflow of million 
this increase in cash provided is due primarily to the net million increase in the liquidation of our available for sale investments 
the characterization of investments between available for sale investments and cash equivalents varies based upon the maturity date of the investment 
accordingly  if an available for sale investment matures or is sold and the proceeds are used to purchase a cash equivalent security  then this would represent a liquidation of available for sale investments 
in we liquidated a net of million of short term investments  which has been purchased with net proceeds of our issuances of common stock and convertible subordinated notes 
this net reduction of short term investments was used to fund million of purchases of property and equipment and to partially fund our negative operating cash flows 
the purchases of property and equipment primarily related to our acquisition of land and buildings in switzerland  and related improvements  and the build out of our exton  pennsylvania manufacturing facility 
financing activities 
cash provided by financing activities was million during the year ended december   as compared to cash provided of million in the prior year 
the current year amount consists of the funds received related to one stock option exercise 
the prior year proceeds consisted substantially of a the proceeds from the sale of  shares of common stock in a public offering in june for cash totaling million  after deducting the costs and expenses associated with the sale and b the proceeds from the sale of million in principal amount of convertible subordinated notes due november   netting million  after deducting the costs and expenses associated with the sale and our  share purchase of treasury stock 
in november  we issued million in principal amount of convertible subordinated notes due november  the convertible subordinated notes are convertible at the option of the holder into our common stock at an initial conversion rate subject to adjustment of shares of common stock per  principal amount of convertible subordinated notes  which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share  at any time prior to the stated maturity 
in the event of certain fundamental changes that occur prior to november   we are required to pay a make whole premium to the holders of the convertible subordinated notes that convert their convertible subordinated notes into our common stock on or after the date on which notice of such fundamental change is given 
the net proceeds from the convertible subordinated notes were approximately million 
we used approximately million of the proceeds to repurchase  shares of common stock  and intend to use the remainder for general corporate purposes working capital at december   we had cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and available for sale investments of million and working capital of million including our cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and available for sale investments 
the substantial majority of our working capital change relates to the use of our cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and available for sale investments for the purpose of funding and operating our business  including capital expenditures 
we believe our existing capital resources are adequate to finance our operations until june   however  our long term viability is dependent upon successful operation of our business  our ability to improve and or automate our manufacturing process  the approval of our products and the ability to raise additional debt and equity to meet our business objectives 
factors affecting our capital resources in april  we acquired a two building   square foot corporate campus in bevaix  canton of neuch tel  switzerland for million 
the million purchase price was paid using cash on hand from the proceeds of our issuances of common stock and convertible subordinated notes 
our initial estimate of the total cost of acquisition and renovation of the facility  including the purchase of required equipment  was million 
we have spent approximately million to date on the first phase of the renovation 
at the present time  management is re assessing the need for a second manufacturing facility in europe 
until such an assessment is made  we do not expect to incur any material additional expenditures for renovation 
we received a financing offer of approximately million for the purchase and renovation 
in addition  we obtained a financial incentive package of government grants and a number of years of tax free status 
however  we do not intend to avail ourselves of the foregoing financial arrangements 
if we determine to proceed with further renovations  it will require a significant cash expenditure 
the european union has introduced new legislation  directive ec relating to human tissue and cells for human application and the facilities in which they are manufactured  which was to be effective april  our facility in the united kingdom does not currently comply with the directive 
the european commission has not yet developed or adopted required technical guidelines relating to this directive 
we believe that implementation of the directive is unlikely until these guidelines are developed and adopted both by the european commission and by the member states of the european union 
we currently estimate that if we are required to comply with the directive  such compliance will require approximately million in renovations to our united kingdom facility 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes the amounts of payments due under specified contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations less than year years years more than years in millions long term debt obligations  excluding interest interest lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on the registrant s balance sheet under gaap total the table above assumes that our convertible subordinated notes will be called due on november  refer to the below for a description of our convertible subordinated notes 
in addition to the above  we have  in the ordinary course of business  various contractual agreements with various consultants and service providers whereby a fee or rate per hour has been agreed to  but no guaranteed minimums have been established 
generally  such agreements are related to our research and development efforts or general operating matters 
the above table should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements  which illustrate a net loss of million  net cash used in operations of million during and cash paid for capital expenditures of million during in november  we issued million in principal amount of convertible subordinated notes due november   although these notes may be due sooner as discussed below 
the notes are our general  unsecured obligations 
the notes are subordinated in right of payment  which means that they will rank in right of payment behind other indebtedness of ours 
in addition  the notes are effectively subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of our subsidiaries 
we will be required to repay the full principal amount of the notes on november  unless they are previously converted  redeemed or repurchased 
the notes bear interest at an annual rate of from the date of issuance of the notes 
we will pay interest twice a year  on each may and november  until the principal is paid or made available for payment or the notes have been converted 
interest will be calculated on the basis of a day year consisting of twelve day months 
the note holders may convert the notes into shares of our common stock at any time before the close of business on november   unless the notes have been previously redeemed or repurchased 
the initial conversion rate which is subject to adjustment for the notes is shares of common stock per  principal amount of notes  which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share 
holders of notes called for redemption or submitted for repurchase will be entitled to convert the notes up to and including the business day immediately preceding the date fixed for redemption or repurchase 
at any time on or after november   we may redeem some or all of the notes at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of such notes plus accrued and unpaid interest including additional interest  if any to  but excluding  the redemption date 
the note holders will have the right to require us to repurchase their notes on november of  and in addition  if we experience a fundamental change which generally will be deemed to occur upon the occurrence of a change in control or a termination of trading of our common stock  note holders will have the right to require us to repurchase their notes 
in the event of certain fundamental changes that occur on or prior to november   we will also pay a make whole premium to holders that require us to purchase their notes in connection with such fundamental change 
off balance sheet transactions we do not engage in material off balance sheet transactions 
other inflation 
inflation did not have a significant impact on our results for year ended december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates 
we are exposed to market risk in the form of foreign exchange rate risk and interest rate risk 
foreign exchange rate risk our revenue earned in the year ended december  was derived from operations in the united kingdom 
the results of operations and financial position of our foreign operations were principally measured in their respective functional currencies and translated into us dollars 
the effect of us dollar currency fluctuations against the foreign currency in these countries is somewhat mitigated by the fact that expenses are generally incurred in the same currencies in which the revenue is generated 
our income will be higher or lower depending on the weakening or strengthening of the us dollar against the respective foreign currency 
additionally  approximately of our assets at december  were based in our foreign operations and translated into us dollars at the foreign currency exchange rate in effect as of the end of each accounting period  with the effect of such translation reflected as a separate component of consolidated shareholders equity deficit 
accordingly  our consolidated shareholders equity deficit will fluctuate depending on the weakening or strengthening of the us dollar against the respective foreign currency 
during  we purchased approximately million of land and buildings located in switzerland  and expended approximately an additional million for related build out costs 
these assets are translated from swiss francs into us dollars each accounting period and the effect of such translation is reflected as a separate component of consolidated shareholders equity deficit 
as discussed above  our consolidated shareholders equity deficit fluctuates depending on the weakening or strengthening of the us dollar against the foreign currency in which foreign assets and liabilities are denominated 
as a result of declining foreign currency exchange rates since december   specifically the exchange rate between the us dollar and the british pound and the swiss franc  our accumulated other comprehensive income of million at december  has decreased to an accumulated other comprehensive loss of million at december   or a change of approximately million 
however  this loss is considered unrealized and is reflected on the consolidated balance sheet 
accordingly  this unrealized loss may increase or decrease in the future  based on the movement of foreign currency exchange rates  but will not have an impact on net income loss until the related foreign capital investments are sold or otherwise realized 
further  during december we completed the substantial liquidation of our australian entity 
as such  the accumulated translation adjustment component was removed from equity by recording million as other income in the consolidated statement of operations 
interest rate risk at december  we had million invested in available for sale investments  comprised of marketable debt securities see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
such investments would generally subject us to interest rate risk  in that increases in interest rates would cause the market value of the investments to decline and decreases in interest rates would cause the market value of the investments to increase 
however  all million of our investments are in the form of auction rate securities for which the interest rate is reset periodically through a dutch auction process 
as a result  the interest rate we earn on those investments in future periods could decline if market interest rates decline  and could increase if market interest rates increase  yet the value of the investments should remain relatively fixed as a result of the periodic resetting of interest rates 
our investments represent the temporary investment of the proceeds of our equity and debt placements until these funds are needed for operating purposes 
accordingly  the december  level of investments will not be held throughout and beyond  and as a result our exposure to interest rate risk must be judged accordingly 
our  million convertible subordinated notes  pay interest at a fixed rate and  accordingly  we are not exposed to interest rate risk as a result of this debt 
however  the fair value of our million convertible subordinated notes does vary based upon  among other factors  the price of our common stock and current interest rates on similar instruments 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes
