overview 
we produce and sell pulverized limestone  quicklime  hydrated lime and lime slurry 
the principal factors affecting our success are the level of demand for our products  and whether we are able to maintain sufficient production levels and product quality while controlling costs 
inclement weather conditions generally reduce the demand for lime and limestone products supplied to construction related customers that account for a significant amount of our revenues 
inclement weather also 
table of contents interferes with our open pit mining operations and can disrupt our plant production  as in the case of flooding and winter ice storms in texas in recent years 
demand for our products in our market areas is also affected by general economic conditions  the pace of home construction and the demand for steel  as well as the level of governmental funding for highway construction 
in recent years  the demand and prices for lime and limestone products have continued to improve  although demand by the steel industry declined beginning in mid may and through the end of the year 
demand by the steel industry has improved in in august  president bush signed the safe  accountable  flexible  and equitable transportation equity act safetea which reauthorizes the federal highway  public transportation  highway safety  and motor carrier safety programs for fiscal years through safetea provides nearly a increase in funding over the transportation equity act for the st century 
as a result  we believe there will be a continuing strong level of demand for lime and limestone products used in highway construction for the next several years 
our recent modernization and expansion projects in texas and arkansas  including the construction of a third kiln at arkansas that should be completed in summer  and our december  acquisition of st 
clair have positioned us to meet the increasing demand for high quality lime and limestone products in our markets  with our lime out put capacity more than doubling and our limestone production capacity increasing more than since our modernization and expansion projects have also equipped us with up to date  fuel efficient plant facilities  which should result in lower production costs and greater operating efficiencies  thus enhancing our competitive position 
in order for our plants to operate at peak efficiency  we must meet operational challenges that arise from time to time  including bringing new facilities on line and refurbishing and or improving newly acquired facilities  such as st 
clair  as well as operating existing facilities efficiently 
our primary variable cost is energy 
natural gas prices remain high  and solid fuel and electric costs have also increased significantly 
in addition  due to delivery problems  we sometimes have to purchase higher priced coal from sources other than our normal provider 
we have been able to mitigate to some degree the adverse impact of these cost increases by varying the mixes of fuel used in our kilns  and by passing on some of our increased energy costs to our customers through higher prices and or surcharges on certain products 
we have not  to date  engaged in any significant hedging activity in an effort to control our energy costs 
in the past  we have  however  entered into forward purchase contracts for natural gas for the winter months in order to provide greater predictability to this cost component  and we may do so again in the future 
we financed our texas and arkansas modernization and expansion projects through a combination of a common stock rights offering to our shareholders  debt financing  including the issuance in august of  of unsecured subordinate notes  which have been fully repaid  and cash flows from operations 
we financed our  acquisition cost for the st 
clair acquisition primarily from a new long term loan 
during  we will need to borrow additional money to complete the third kiln at arkansas  which we estimate will cost approximately  given our increased level of debt  we must generate sufficient cash flows to cover ongoing capital and debt service needs 
all of our long term debt becomes due in as a result of our texas and arkansas modernization and expansion projects  our yearly depreciation  depletion and amortization expense included in cost of revenues increased from  in to  in  while our gross profit increased from  to  over the same period 
our construction of the third kiln at arkansas and the acquisitions of st 
clair and the delta  colorado facilities will further increase our depreciation expense 
in addition  since  our interest expense has increased from  to  in excluding approximately  of interest capitalized in  as the amount of our borrowings has increased 
during and  we refinanced our bank debt  reducing our interest rate to approximately from approximately  and prepaid the  of subordinated notes  which bore a interest rate 
however  we expect our interest expense in to be higher due to our increased debt levels 
in order for us to continue to increase our profitability in the face of these increased fixed and variable costs  we must maintain our revenues and cash flows and continue to control our operational and selling  general and administrative expenses  including new corporate governance compliance costs resulting from the sarbanes oxley act of and associated regulatory requirements 
we also continue to explore ways to expand our operations and production capacity through additional capital projects and acquisitions 
as of may  we entered into an oil and gas lease agreement with eog resources  inc eog with respect to oil and gas rights on our cleburne  texas property  that will continue so long as eog is continuously developing the leased property as set forth in the lease 
pursuant to the lease  we received lease bonus payments totaling  which are reflected in other income for in addition  we retained a royalty interest in oil and gas produced from any successful wells drilled on the leased property and an option to participate in any 
table of contents well drilled on the leased property as a working interest owner  provided we elect to participate prior to the commencement of each well 
during the fourth quarter  drilling of the first well under the company s oil and gas lease was completed  and gas production began in february in addition to our royalty interest  we elected to participate as a working interest owner in this well 
no reserves or production specifics for the well will be known until sufficient production has been logged 
we have also elected to participate as a working interest owner in the next two wells the operator drilled in january and february estimated drilling costs for our working interest are approximately  per well 
we believe the enhanced production capacity resulting from our modernization and expansion efforts at the texas and arkansas plants  including the third kiln at arkansas  our recent acquisition of st 
clair in oklahoma  and the operational strategies that we have implemented have allowed us to increase production  improve product quality  better serve existing customers  attract new customers and control our costs 
there can be no assurance  however  that demand and prices for our lime and limestone products will remain strong  that our production will not be adversely affected by weather related or other operational problems  that we can successfully integrate  refurbish and improve our newly acquired oklahoma operations  that our results will not be adversely affected by continued increases in energy costs or new environmental requirements  or that our production capacity  revenues  net income and cash flows will continue to be strong 
restatement of revenues and cost of revenues 
revenues for and have been restated to include external freight billed to customers with related costs in costs of revenues  resulting in no change in gross profit  operating profit or net income 
revenues and cost of revenues for and have both been increased for such external freight by  and  respectively 
critical accounting policies 
the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent liabilities  at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates and judgments under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant management judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies require the most significant management estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivable 
we are required to estimate the collectability of our trade receivables 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the ultimate realization of these receivables and determining our allowance for doubtful accounts 
the majority of our trade receivables are unsecured 
payment terms for our trade receivables are based on underlying purchase orders  contracts or purchase agreements 
credit losses relating to these receivables consistently have been within management expectations 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with the terms of purchase orders  contracts or purchase agreements  which are generally upon shipment  and payment is considered probable 
revenues include external freight billed to customers with related costs included in cost of revenues 
long lived assets 
we review long term assets for impairment in accordance with the guidelines of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
sfas requires that  when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable  we should determine if impairment of value exists 
if the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment exists and an impairment loss must be calculated and recorded 
if an impairment exists  the impairment loss is calculated based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over the asset s fair value 
any impairment loss is treated as a permanent reduction in the carrying value of the asset 
deferred tax assets 
we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need  if any  for a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in the event that we determine that all or part of the net deferred tax assets 
table of contents would not be realizable in the future  an adjustment to deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
environmental costs 
we record environmental accruals  based on studies and estimates  when it is probable that we have incurred a reasonably estimable liability 
the accruals are adjusted when further information warrants an adjustment 
environmental expenditures that extend the life  increase the capacity or improve the safety or efficiency of company owned assets or are incurred to mitigate or prevent future possible environmental contamination are capitalized 
other environmental costs are expensed when incurred 
contingencies 
we are party to proceedings  lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of business relating to environmental  labor  product and other matters 
we are required to estimate the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters  as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each individual issue  including coverage under our insurance policies 
this determination may change in the future because of new developments 
derivatives 
we record the fair value of gas forward purchase contracts on our balance sheet  with the offsetting entry to other operating expense 
any subsequent mark to market adjustments result in an increase or decrease of other operating expense 
we record the fair value of our interest rate hedge on our balance sheet and include any changes in fair value in other comprehensive income loss 
warrant share put liability 
prior to its waiver in august  we estimated the fair value of our warrant share put liability quarterly based on the per share average closing price of our common stock for the last days of the quarter compared to the per share exercise price 
the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the warrant share put liability was being accreted  and the effect on fair value of future changes in the repurchase price for each share was accreted or decreted  over the five year period from the date of issuance to august   after which the warrant holders could have required us to repurchase any or all shares acquired through exercise of the warrants 
therefore  prior to the waiver  increases in our per share common stock prices resulted in an increased liability and increased interest expense from accretion 
pension plan 
we have one noncontributory defined benefit pension plan 
all benefits for participants in the plan were frozen as of july  our costs  credits and funded status for this plan are developed from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions  including discount rates and expected long term return on plan assets 
future costs  credits and funded status for this plan may change should conditions warrant changes in the assumptions

the increase in revenues for compared to was primarily due to average price increases for our products of  and increased sales volumes to our construction customers during the fourth quarter due in part to unseasonably dry weather in the south central region 
in addition  higher than normal levels of rainfall in our texas market area in the third quarter resulted in reduced construction demand for products from our cleburne  texas plant

table of contents due in part to continuing lime shortages principally in the eastern half of the united states  we sold substantially all of the increased lime production at arkansas during these shortages were primarily due to increased consumption of lime for steel related uses and the closing of three lime plants in the midwest in our gross profit increased to  for from  for  an increase of  or

the largest changes in working capital items in were a  increase in trade receivables  primarily resulting from increased sales resulting from increased lime production from the second kiln at arkansas which came on line in late february  and a  increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
banking facilities and debt 
on october   we entered into an amendment to our credit agreement the amendment primarily to increase the loan commitments and extend the maturity dates 
as a 
table of contents result of the amendment  our credit agreement now includes a ten year  term loan the new term loan  a ten year  multiple draw term loan the draw term loan and a five year  revolving credit facility the new revolving facility collectively  the new credit facilities 
the proceeds from the new term loan were used primarily to repay the outstanding balances on our term loan and revolving credit facility under our credit agreement prior to the amendment 
in december  we drew down  on the draw term loan to acquire us lime company st 
clair described below 
we have not yet made any draws on the new revolving facility 
the new term loan requires quarterly principal payments of  beginning march   which equates to a year amortization  with a final principal payment of  due on december  the draw term loan will require quarterly principal payments  based on a year amortization  of the principal outstanding thereon on january   beginning march   with a final principal payment on december  equal to any remaining principal then outstanding 
the new revolving facility is scheduled to mature on october  the maturity of the new term loan  the draw term loan and the new revolving facility can be accelerated if any event of default  as defined under the new credit facilities  occurs 
the new credit facilities continue to bear interest  at our option  at either libor plus a margin of to  or the bank s prime rate plus a margin of minus to plus 
the margins are determined quarterly in accordance with a defined rate spread based upon the ratio of our average total funded senior indebtedness for the preceding four quarters to ebitda for the twelve months ended on the last day of the most recent calendar quarter 
there were no material changes to the covenants and restrictions contained in our credit agreement as a result of the amendment 
in conjunction with the amendment  we terminated our existing hedge and rolled its value into a new hedge the new term loan hedge to buy down the fixed interest rate 
the new term loan hedge fixes libor at on the  new term loan for the period december  through its maturity date  resulting in an interest rate of based on the current libor margin of 
effective december   we also entered into a hedge that fixes libor at on the  balance outstanding on the draw term loan through its maturity date  resulting in an interest rate of based on the libor margin of 
we designated both hedges as cash flow hedges  and as such  changes in the fair market value will be included in other comprehensive income or loss 
we will be exposed to credit losses in the event of non performance by the counterparty of the hedges 
on august   we entered into a credit agreement with a bank the lender that  prior to the amendment  included a five year  term loan the term loan  and a three year  revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility collectively  the credit facilities 
at the closing of the credit facilities  we borrowed  the entire term loan  and  on the revolving credit facility to repay the outstanding balances  including a prepayment penalty and accrued interest  on our previous bank term loan and revolving credit facility

the margins were for libor and for prime rate loans during from august to december   the weighted average interest rate on our borrowings under the credit facilities was approximately 
in conjunction with the credit facilities  we entered into a hedge to fix the libor rate for the term loan at on  for the period september  through the maturity date  and on the remaining principal balance of approximately  for the period december  through the maturity date  resulting in an interest rate of for the term loan based on the then existing margin of

the new credit facilities and security agreement contain  as did the credit facilities  covenants that restrict the incurrence of debt  guaranties and liens  and place restrictions on investments and the sale of significant assets 
we are also required to meet a minimum debt service coverage ratio and not exceed specified leverage ratios 
the new credit facilities provide that we may pay annual dividends  not to exceed  so long as 
table of contents after such payment  we remain solvent and the payment does not cause or result in any default or event of default as defined under the new credit facilities 
as a result of entering into the credit facilities and borrowings thereunder on august   we repaid all of the  then outstanding debt under our previous  senior secured term loan the old term loan and terminated the associated credit agreement that had been entered into on april  with a consortium of commercial banks 
the old term loan was repayable over a period of approximately eight years  maturing on march   and required monthly principal payments of  which began april   with a final principal payment of  on march   which equated to a year amortization

beall  who owns approximately of our outstanding shares 
we believe that the terms of the private placement were more favorable to the company than proposals previously received 
frost securities  inc frost provided an opinion to our board of directors that  from a financial point of view  the private placement was fair to the unaffiliated holders of our common stock in relation to other potential subordinated debt transactions then available to us 
we paid frost an aggregate of  for its advice  placement services and opinion 
the net proceeds of approximately  from the private placement were primarily used to fund the phase ii expansion of our arkansas facilities

the terms of the sub notes were identical to one another  except that the sub note for the affiliate of inberdon did not prohibit prepayment prior to august  and did not require a prepayment penalty if repaid before maturity  resulting in a weighted average prepayment penalty of approximately if the sub notes were repaid before maturity 
the sub notes require compliance with our other debt agreements and restrict the sale of significant assets 
the private placement also included six year detachable warrants  providing the sub note investors the right to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock  at of the average closing price of one share of common stock for the trailing trading days prior to closing  or 
the fair value of the warrants was recorded as a reduction of the carrying value of the sub notes and was accreted over the term of the sub notes  resulting in an effective annual interest rate of 
after august   or upon an earlier change in control  the investors could require us to repurchase any or all shares acquired through exercise of the warrants the warrant shares 
the repurchase price for each warrant share was equal to the average closing price of one share of our common stock for the trading days preceding the date the warrant shares were put back to us 
changes in the repurchase price for each warrant share were accreted or decreted to interest expense over the five year period from the date of issuance to august  the investors are also entitled to certain registration rights for the resale of their warrant shares 
effective august   the holders of the warrants agreed to waive their warrant share put rights 
our warrant share put liability was  as of august   which was eliminated by the waiver agreements

capital expenditures 
we completed the modernization and expansion project at our cleburne  texas facility at the end of in addition  during the fourth quarter  we commissioned a new line for the production of pulverized limestone pls at our cleburne facility and  in  constructed an additional storage facility there 
the lack of reliability of a single pls production line had been a restraining factor on sales to several large customers requiring around the clock availability 
these investments have allowed us to better serve existing customers and to pursue new business opportunities  resulting in new pls customers 
the first of two phases of the arkansas modernization and expansion project began in the fourth quarter phase i involved the redevelopment of the quarry plant  rebuilding of the railroad to standard gauge  the purchase of a facility to establish an out of state terminal in shreveport  louisiana  the installation of a rotary kiln with preheater and increased product storage and loading capacity 
we completed phase i in the second quarter phase ii doubled the arkansas plant s quicklime production capacity through the installation of a second preheater rotary kiln and additional kiln run storage capacity substantially identical to the kiln system built in phase i 
construction of the second kiln system commenced in the third quarter and was completed with lime production from the new kiln beginning in late february phase ii also included refurbishing the distribution terminal in shreveport  louisiana  which is connected to a railroad  to provide lime storage  hydrating and distribution capacity to service markets in louisiana and east texas 
this terminal began operations in december as of october   we entered into the initial contract for the construction of a third kiln at the company s arkansas facilities 
the third kiln will be similar to the existing two kilns and will increase quicklime production capacity at the arkansas facilities by approximately 
the project  which will also include certain crushing and stone handling enhancements  and additional finished goods silos and load outs  is currently expected to be completed in summer and cost approximately  which will be funded from draws on the draw term loan and or the new revolving facility and funds generated from operations

in september  we spent approximately  for the acquisition  in an asset purchase  of a new limestone grinding and bagging facility located in delta  colorado to process mine safety dust used in coal mining operations 
approximately  of our capital expenditures related to the arkansas phase ii expansion project in in  capital expenditures also included approximately  for the installation of a new kiln baghouse at our texas plant 
on december   we acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of o n minerals st 
clair company  renamed us lime company st 
clair  from a wholly owned subsidiary of oglebay norton company otc bulletin board ogby for  in cash  plus transaction costs 
the purchase price is subject to a working capital adjustment which is expected to be approximately  as of december   including transaction costs  we had paid  and had accrued approximately  we funded the st 
clair purchase with an advance from our draw term loan 
we expect to spend approximately  per year over the next several years for normal recurring capital  environmental compliance and re equipping projects at the plant facilities to maintain or improve efficiency  ensure compliance with environmental laws and reduce costs

we believe that cash on hand  funds generated from operations and amounts available under the new revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our operating needs  ongoing capital needs and debt service for additionally  with our increase in cash flows from operations following the completion of our modernization and expansion projects  including the third kiln at arkansas  and the acquisition of st 
clair  and funds available from our  new revolving credit facility  we believe we will have sufficient capital resources to meet our liquidity needs for the near future 
off balance sheet arrangements 
we do not utilize off balance sheet financing arrangements  however we lease some of our equipment used in our operations under non cancelable operating lease agreements 
as of december   the total future lease payments under various operating leases totaled  and are due in payments through as summarized in the table above 
new accounting pronouncements 
stock options 
on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payments sfas r which is a revision of sfas sfas r supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
accounting for stock issued to employees and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas r is similar to the approach described in sfas  accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
however  sfas r will require all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the our consolidated statements of income based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure will no longer be an alternative 
sfas r must be adopted no later than the annual period beginning after june  and permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method  in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after the adoption date and based on the requirements of sfas for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the adoption date 
a modified retrospective method  which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above but also permits entities to restate either all prior periods presented or prior interim periods of the year of adoption based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas for purposes of pro forma disclosures 
we adopted the provisions of sfas r on january  using the modified prospective method 
as permitted by sfas and noted above  we accounted for share based payments to employees using the intrinsic value method prescribed by apb and related interpretations 
as such  we generally have not 
table of contents recognized compensation expenses associated with employee stock options through december  accordingly  the adoption of sfas r s fair value method could have an adverse impact on our future results of operations  although it will have no material impact on our overall financial condition 
had we adopted sfas r in prior periods  the impact would have approximated the impact of sfas as described in the pro forma net income and earnings per share disclosures in note n of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we estimate that the adoption of sfas r  based on the outstanding unvested stock options at december   will result in an additional compensation expense in of  net of income tax benefit 
stripping costs in the mining industry 
the fasb emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus that stripping costs incurred after a mine begins production are costs of production and therefore should be accounted for as a component of inventory costs eitf issue no 

we currently capitalize certain stripping costs as deferred stripping costs  attribute them to the reserves that have been exposed and amortize them into cost of revenues using the units of production method 
as of december  and  we had  and  respectively  of capitalized deferred stripping costs 
the eitf stated that the new required accounting for stripping costs would be effective for years beginning after december  as a result of adopting this accounting change  we will expense the  capitalized deferred stripping costs in the first quarter inventory costs 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter this amendment requires abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted materials spoilage to be recognized as current period charges 
this standard also requires that the allocation of fixed production overhead to the cost of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
this standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we do not believe that compliance with this new pronouncement will have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations  cash flows or competitive position
