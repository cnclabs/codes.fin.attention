item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation  it is important to have an understanding of three factors the nature of the contracts from which we derive our revenues  the difficulty in comparing our results of operations across periods because of our acquisition activity  and the nature of our relationship with markwest hydrocarbon  inc our contracts we generate substantially all of our revenues and net operating margin defined as revenues less purchased product costs see explanation of net operating margin below from natural gas gathering  processing and transmission  ngl transportation  fractionation and storage  and crude oil gathering and transportation 
we have a variety of contract types 
in many cases  we provide services under contracts that contain a combination of more than one of the arrangements described below 
fee based arrangements 
under these arrangements  we receive fees for gathering  processing and transmission of natural gas  transportation  fractionation and storage of ngls  and gathering and transportation of crude oil 
the revenue we earn from these arrangements is directly related to the volume of natural gas  ngls or crude oil that flows through our systems and facilities  and is not directly dependent on commodity prices 
in certain cases  our arrangements provide for minimum annual payments 
should a sustained decline in commodity prices result in a decline in volumes  however  our revenues from these arrangements would be reduced 
percent of proceeds arrangements 
under these arrangements  we generally gather and process natural gas on behalf of producers  sell the resulting residue gas and ngls at market prices  and remit to producers an agreed upon percentage of the proceeds based on an index price 
in other cases  instead of remitting cash payments to the producer  we deliver an agreed upon percentage of the residue gas and ngls to the producer  and sell the volumes we keep to third parties at market prices 
under these types of arrangements  our revenues and net operating margins generally increase as natural gas prices and ngl prices increase  and our revenues and net operating margins decrease as natural gas and ngl prices decrease 
the most common arrangement is a percent of liquids or pol contract 
percent of index arrangements 
under these arrangements  we generally purchase natural gas at either a percentage discount to a specified index price  a specified index price less a fixed amount  or a percentage discount to a specified index price less an additional fixed amount 
we then gather and deliver the natural gas to pipelines  where we resell the natural gas at the index price  or at a different percentage discount to the index price 
the net operating margins we realize under these arrangements decrease in periods of low natural gas prices  because these net operating margins are based on a percentage of the index price 
conversely  our net operating margins increase during periods of high natural gas prices 
keep whole arrangements 
under these arrangements  we gather natural gas from the producer  process the natural gas to extract ngls  sell the ngls to third parties and pay the producer  in the form of processed gas or its cash equivalent  for the full thermal equivalent volume of raw natural gas we received from the producer 
accordingly  our net operating margin is a function of the difference between the value of the extracted ngls that we sell and the cost of the processed gas that would replace the thermal equivalent value of those ngls 
the profitability of these arrangements is subject not only to the commodity price risk of natural gas and ngls but also to the price of natural gas relative to the price of ngls 
our net operating margins increase under these arrangements when the value of ngls is high relative to the cost of a thermal equivalent amount of natural gas  and our net operating margins decrease when the cost of natural gas is high relative to the value of a thermal equivalent amount of ngls 
settlement margin 
typically  we are allowed to retain a fixed percentage of the volume gathered to cover the compression fuel charges and deemed line losses 
when our gathering systems operate more efficiently than specified  per contract allowance  we can retain the difference for our own account 
condensate sales 
during the gathering process  thermodynamic forces contribute to changes in operating characteristics of the natural gas flowing through the pipeline 
as a result  hydrocarbon dew points are reached  causing condensation of hydrocarbons in the high pressure pipelines 
condensate collected in the system is sold at a monthly crude oil index based price  and we keep the proceeds 
the terms of our contracts vary based on gas quality  the competitive environment at the time the contracts are signed and customer requirements 
our contract mix and  accordingly  our exposure to natural gas and ngl prices  may change due to changes in producer preferences  our expansion in regions where some types of contracts are more common  and other market factors 
any change in mix will affect our financial results 
at december   our primary exposure to keep whole contracts was limited to our arapaho oklahoma processing plant and our east texas processing contracts 
at the arapaho plant inlet  the btu content of the natural gas meets the downstream pipeline specification  meaning it does not need to be processed to remove contaminants  however  we have the option of extracting ngls when the processing margin environment is favorable 
in addition  approximately half  as measured in volumes  of the related gas gathering contracts include additional fees to cover plant operating costs  fuel costs and shrinkage costs in a low processing margin environment 
because of our ability to operate the plant in several recovery modes  including turning it off  coupled with the additional fees provided for in the gas gathering contracts  our overall keep whole contract exposure is limited to a small portion of the operating costs of the plant 
approximately of the gas processed in east texas for producers was processed under keep whole terms 
our keep whole exposure in this area was offset to a great extent because the east texas agreements provide for the retention of natural gas as a part of the gathering and compression arrangements with all producers on the system 
this excess gas helps offset the amount of replacement natural gas purchases required to keep our producers whole on an mmbtu basis  thereby creating a partial natural hedge 
the net result is a significant reduction in volatility for these changes in natural gas prices 
the remaining volatility for these contracts results from changes in ngl prices 
the partnership has an active commodity risk management program in place to reduce the impacts of changing ngl prices 
management evaluates contract performance on the basis of net operating margin a non gaap financial measure  which is defined as income loss from operations  excluding facility expenses  selling  general and administrative expense  depreciation  amortization  impairments and accretion of asset retirement obligations 
these charges have been excluded for the purpose of enhancing the understanding  by both management and investors  of the underlying baseline operating performance of our contractual arrangements  which management uses to evaluate our financial performance  for purposes of planning and forecasting future periods 
net operating margin does not have any standardized definition and  therefore  is unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other reporting companies 
net operating margin results should not be evaluated in isolation of  or as a substitute for  our financial results prepared in accordance with united states gaap 
our usage of net operating margin  and the underlying methodology in excluding certain charges  is not necessarily an indication of the results of operations that may be expected in the future  or that we will not  in fact  incur such charges in future periods 
the following reconciles this non gaap financial measure to income from operations  the most comparable gaap financial measure in thousands december  revenues purchased product costs net operating margin facility expenses selling  general and administrative expenses depreciation amortization of intangible assets accretion of asset retirement obligation impairments income from operations for the year ended december   the following table summarizes the percentages of revenue and net operating margin we generated by types of contracts  exclusive of the impact of commodity derivatives fee based percent of proceeds percent of index keep whole total revenues net operating margin includes other types of arrangements tied to ngl prices

our relationship with markwest hydrocarbon  inc we were formed by markwest hydrocarbon to acquire most of its natural gas gathering and processing assets and ngl transportation  fractionation and storage assets 
under a services agreement between markwest hydrocarbon and us  markwest hydrocarbon acts in a management capacity  rendering day to day operational  business  asset management  accounting  personnel and related administrative services to us 
in return  we reimburse markwest hydrocarbon for all expenses incurred on our behalf 
in addition  we entered into various agreements with markwest hydrocarbon in connection with the closing of our initial public offering 
specifically  we entered into an omnibus agreement company governing potential competition and indemnification obligations among us and the other parties to the agreement  a gas processing agreement governing our obligations with respect to the processing of natural gas at our kenova  boldman and cobb processing plants  a pipeline liquids transportation agreement governing our obligations with respect to the transportation of mixed ngls to our siloam fractionation facility  a fractionation  storage and loading agreement governing our obligations with respect to the unloading and fractionation of ngls and the storage of the ngl products at our siloam facility  and a natural gas liquids purchase agreement which governs our obligations with respect to the sale and purchase of ngl products we acquire under the gas processing maytown agreement between a third party producer and markwest hydrocarbon  which were assigned to us  as well as any other ngl products we acquire

segment reporting segments 
we have six segments  based on geographic areas of operations  described below 
for further information  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our contracts  included in item of this form k  and financial statements and supplementary data  included in item of this form k 
southwest business unit east texas 
we own the east texas system  consisting of natural gas gathering system pipelines  centralized compressor stations  and a natural gas processing facility and ngl pipeline that are currently under construction 
the east texas system is located in panola county and services the carthage field  one of texas largest onshore natural gas fields 
producing formations in panola county consist of the cotton valley  pettit and travis peak formations  which together form one of the largest natural gas producing regions in the united states 
the carthage field has an estimated tcf of remaining recoverable reserves  and cumulative historical production in excess of tcf 
oklahoma 
we own the foss lake gathering system and the arapaho gas processing plant  located in roger mills and custer counties of western oklahoma 
the gathering portion consists of a pipeline system that is connected to natural gas wells and associated compression facilities 
all of the gathered gas ultimately is compressed and delivered to the processing plant 
after processing  the residue gas is delivered to a third party pipeline and natural gas liquids are sold to a single customer 
other southwest 
we own natural gas gathering systems located in texas  louisiana  mississippi and new mexico 
these systems generally service long lived natural gas basins that continue to experience drilling activity 
we gather a significant portion of the gas produced from fields adjacent to our gathering systems 
in many areas we are the primary gatherer  and in some of the areas served by our smaller systems we are the sole gatherer 
in addition  we own four lateral pipelines in texas and new mexico 
northeast business unit appalachia 
we are the largest processor of natural gas in the appalachian basin with fully integrated processing  fractionation  storage and marketing operations 
the appalachian basin is a large natural gas producing region characterized by long lived reserves and modest decline rates 
our appalachian assets include five natural gas processing plants  an ngl pipeline  an ngl fractionation plant and two caverns for storing propane 
michigan 
we own a common carrier crude oil gathering pipeline in michigan 
we refer to this system as the michigan crude pipeline 
we also own a natural gas gathering system and a natural gas processing plant in michigan gulf coast business unit javelina 
on november   we acquired of the equity interests in javelina company  javelina pipeline company and javelina land company  llc  which were owned  and  respectively  by subsidiaries of el paso corporation  kerr mcgee corporation  and valero energy corporation 
the javelina entities own and operate a natural gas processing facility in corpus christi  texas  which treats and processes off gas from six local refineries 
the facility was constructed in to recover hydrogen and up to  barrels per day of ngls  including olefins ethylene and propylene  ethane  propane  mixed butane and pentanes 
the facility processes approximately to mmcf d of inlet gas  but is expected to process up to its capacity of mmcf d as refinery output continues to grow 
the following summarizes the percentage of our revenue and net operating margin generated by our assets  by geographic region  for the year ended december  east texas oklahoma other southwest appalachia michigan gulf coast total revenue net operating margin regulatory matters our activities are subject to various federal  state and local laws and regulations  as well as orders of regulatory bodies  governing a wide variety of matters  including marketing  production  pricing  community right to know  protection of the environment  safety and other matters 
in many cases  various phases of our gas  liquids and crude oil operations in the states in which we operate are subject to rate and service regulation 
applicable statutes generally require that our rates  and terms and conditions of service  provide no more than a fair return on the aggregate value of the facilities used to render services 
in general  the federal energy regulatory commission ferc has jurisdiction over natural gas pipelines and operators that provide natural gas pipeline transportation services in interstate commerce 
section b of the natural gas policy act nga  however  exempts natural gas gathering facilities from the jurisdiction of ferc 
we own a number of natural gas pipelines that we have evaluated  and concluded they meet the traditional tests ferc has used to establish a pipeline s status as a gatherer not subject to the agency s jurisdiction 
additionally  our intrastate natural gas pipeline operations generally are not subject to rate regulation by ferc  although they are regulated by various agencies of the states in which they are located  principally the texas railroad commission  or trrc 
our appalachian pipeline carries ngls across state lines 
the primary shipper on the pipeline is markwest hydrocarbon  which has entered into agreements with us providing for a fixed transportation charge for the term of the agreements 
they expire on december  we are the only other shipper on the pipeline 
as we neither operate our appalachian pipeline as a common carrier  nor hold it out for service to the public generally  there are currently no third party shippers on this pipeline and the pipeline is  and will continue to be  operated as a proprietary facility 
the likelihood of other entities seeking to utilize our appalachian pipeline is remote  so it should not be subject to regulation by the ferc in the future 
we cannot provide assurance  however  that ferc will not at some point determine that such transportation is within its jurisdiction  or that such an assertion would not adversely affect our results of operations 
in such a case  we would be required to file a tariff with ferc and provide a cost justification for the transportation charge 
regardless of any ferc action  however  markwest hydrocarbon has agreed to not challenge the status of our appalachian pipeline or the transportation charge during the term of our agreements 
with respect to the partnership s michigan crude pipeline  in response to a shipper inquiry to the federal energy regulatory commission and following unsuccessful ferc requested rate structure discussions with the shippers  ferc recently requested that we file a tariff 
the partnership filed a tariff with the agency establishing a cost of service rate structure to be effective starting january  two shippers and a producer protested the filing 
the partnership vigorously defended its tariff  and on december   the commission rejected the protestors request for interim rates and accepted the partnership s filing 
the new rate structure became effective january  the commission established hearing procedures for the tariff filing  but held them in abeyance pending the outcome of ferc sponsored settlement discussions  which the parties now have been referred to under the agency s procedures 
the partnership cannot predict whether the ferc tariff protest or any settlement will adversely affect its michigan crude pipeline results of operations 
environmental matters general 
our processing and fractionation plants  pipelines  and associated facilities are subject to multiple environmental obligations and potential liabilities under a variety of federal  state and local laws and regulations 
these include  without limitation the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act  the resource conservation and recovery act  the clean air act  the federal water pollution control act or the clean water act  the oil pollution act  and analogous state and local laws and regulations 
such laws and regulations affect many aspects of our present and future operations  and generally require us to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental registrations  licenses  permits  inspections and other approvals  with respect to air emissions  water quality  wastewater discharges  and solid and hazardous waste management 
failure to comply with these requirements may expose us to fines  penalties and or interruptions in our operations that could influence our results of operations 
if an accidental leak  spill or release of hazardous substances occurs at any facilities that we own  operate or otherwise use  or where we send materials for treatment or disposal  we could be held jointly and severally liable for all resulting liabilities  including investigation  remedial and clean up costs 
likewise  we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes or property contamination  including groundwater contamination 
we could also be required to perform remedial operations to prevent future contamination for properties owned  leased or acquired by us which may have been previously operated by third parties that may have released or disposed of hazardous substances or wastes 
any or all of this could materially affect our results of operations and cash flows 
we believe that our operations and facilities are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations  and that the cost of compliance with such laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
we cannot ensure  however  that existing environmental regulations will not be revised or that new regulations will not be adopted or become applicable to us 
the clear trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may be perceived to affect the environment  and thus there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental regulation compliance or remediation  and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate 
revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions  particularly if those costs are not fully recoverable from our customers  could have material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
ongoing remediation and indemnification from a third party 
the previous owner operator of our boldman and cobb facilities has been  or is currently involved in  investigatory or remedial activities with respect to the real property underlying these facilities 
these arise out of a september administrative order by consent for removal actions with epa regions ii  iii  iv  and v  and an agreed order entered into with the kentucky natural resources and environmental protection cabinet in october the previous owner operator has accepted sole liability and responsibility for  and indemnifies markwest hydrocarbon against  any environmental liabilities associated with the epa administrative order  the kentucky agreed order or any other environmental condition related to the real property prior to the effective dates of markwest hydrocarbon s lease or purchase of the real property 
in addition  the previous owner operator has agreed to perform all the required response actions at its expense in a manner that minimizes interference with markwest hydrocarbon s use of the properties 
on may   markwest hydrocarbon assigned to us the benefit of this indemnity from the previous owner operator 
to date  the previous owner operator has been performing all actions required under these agreements and  accordingly  we do not believe that the remediation obligation of these properties will have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
pipeline safety regulations our pipelines are subject to regulation by the us department of transportation dot under the pipeline safety act of  as amended pipeline safety act  and the hazardous liquid pipeline safety act of hlpsa  as amended  and the pipeline integrity management pim in high consequence areas gas transmission pipelines amendment to cfr part  effective february   relating to the design  installation  testing  construction  operation  replacement and management of pipeline facilities 
the pipeline safety act requires the research and special programs administration of the dot to consider environmental impacts  as well as its traditional public safety mandate  when developing pipeline safety regulations 
the dot s pipeline operator qualification rules require minimum qualification requirements for personnel performing operations and maintenance activities on hazardous liquid pipelines 
hlpsa covers crude oil  carbon dioxide  ngl and petroleum products pipelines and requires any entity which owns or operates pipeline facilities to comply with the regulations under hlpsa  to permit access to and allow copying of records and to make certain reports and provide information as required by the secretary of transportation 
the pipeline integrity management in high consequence areas gas transmission pipelines amendment to cfr part pim requires operators of gas transmission pipelines to ensure the integrity of their pipelines through hydrostatic pressure testing  the use of in line inspection tools or through risk based direct assessment techniques 
while we believe that our pipeline operations are in substantial compliance with applicable requirements  due to the possibility of new or amended laws and regulations  or reinterpretation of existing laws and regulations  there can be no assurance that future compliance with the requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial positions 
on november   a leak and release of vapors occurred in a pipeline transporting ngls from the partnership s maytown gas processing plant to the partnership s siloam fractionator 
this pipeline is owned by a third party  and leased and operated by the partnership s subsidiary  markwest energy appalachia  llc 
a subsequent ignition and fire from the leaked vapors resulted in property damage to five homes and injuries to some of the residents 
pursuant to a corrective action order issued by the federal office of pipeline safety ops on november  and amended november   ops required pipeline and valve integrity evaluation  testing and repair efforts  which markwest successfully completed on the affected pipeline segment 
based on  among other things  the successful integrity testing of the affected pipeline  ops authorized a partial return to service of the affected pipeline in october our partial return to service has allowed us to transport substantially all of the volumes through the pipeline that were being transported prior to the incident 
we believe we should be able to satisfy relevant requirements to return to full service and are working with ops 
we anticipate filing a request with ops in the near future to return to full service 
employee safety the workplaces associated with the processing and storage facilities and the pipelines we operate are also subject to oversight from the federal occupational safety and health administration  osha  as well as comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers 
in addition  the osha hazard communication standard requires that we maintain information about hazardous materials used or produced in operations  and that this information be provided to employees  state and local government authorities  and citizens 
we believe that we have conducted our operations in substantial compliance with osha requirements  including general industry standards  record keeping requirements and monitoring of occupational exposure to regulated substances 
in general  we expect industry and regulatory safety standards to become stricter over time  resulting in increased compliance expenditures 
while these expenditures cannot be accurately estimated at this time  we do not expect such expenditures will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
employees we do not have any employees 
our general partner  or its affiliates  employs approximately individuals to operate our facilities and provide general and administrative services  as our agents 
the paper  allied industrial  chemical and energy workers international union local represents employees at our siloam fractionation facility in south shore  kentucky 
the collective bargaining agreement with this union was renewed on july   for a term of three years 
the agreement covers only hourly  non supervisory employees 
we consider labor relations to be satisfactory at this time

item a 
risk factors in addition to the other information set forth elsewhere in this form k  you should carefully consider the following factors when evaluating markwest energy partners 
risks inherent in our business if we are unable to successfully integrate our recent or future acquisitions  our future financial performance may suffer 
our future growth will depend in part on our ability to integrate our recent acquisitions  as well as our ability to acquire additional assets and businesses at competitive prices 
we recently completed the starfish and javelina acquisitions  which geographically expanded our operations into offshore and onshore gulf of mexico operations 
we cannot guarantee that we will successfully integrate these  or any other  acquisitions into our existing operations  or that we will achieve the desired profitability and anticipated results from such acquisitions 
failure to achieve such planned results could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
the integration of acquisitions with our existing business involves numerous risks  including operating a significantly larger combined organization and integrating additional midstream operations into our existing operations  difficulties in the assimilation of the assets and operations of the acquired businesses  especially if the assets acquired are in a new business segment or geographical area  the loss of customers or key employees from the acquired businesses  the diversion of management s attention from other existing business concerns  the failure to realize expected synergies and cost savings  coordinating geographically disparate organizations  systems and facilities  integrating personnel from diverse business backgrounds and organizational cultures  and consolidating corporate and administrative functions 
further  unexpected costs and challenges may arise whenever businesses with different operations or management are combined  and we may experience unanticipated delays in realizing the benefits of an acquisition 
following an acquisition  we may discover previously unknown liabilities subject to the same stringent environmental laws and regulations relating to releases of pollutants into the environment and environmental protection as our existing plants  pipelines and facilities 
if so  our operation of these new assets could cause us to incur increased costs to attain or maintain compliance with such requirements 
if we consummate any future acquisition  our capitalization and results of operation may change significantly  and unitholders will not have the opportunity to evaluate the economic  financial and other relevant information that we will consider in determining the application of these funds and other resources 
our acquisition strategy is based in part on our expectation of ongoing divestitures of assets within the midstream petroleum and natural gas industry 
a material decrease in such divestitures could limit our opportunities for future acquisitions  and could adversely affect our operations and cash flows available for distribution to our unitholders 
growing our business by constructing new pipelines and processing and treating facilities subjects us to construction risks and risks that natural gas supplies will not be available upon completion of the facilities 
one of the ways we intend to grow our business is through the construction of additions to our existing gathering systems and construction of new gathering  processing and treating facilities 
the construction of gathering  processing and treating facilities requires the expenditure of significant amounts of capital  which may exceed our expectations  and involves numerous regulatory  environmental  political and legal uncertainties 
if we undertake these projects  we may not be able to complete them on schedule or at all or at the budgeted cost 
moreover  our revenues may not increase immediately upon the expenditure of funds on a particular project 
for instance  if we build a new pipeline  the construction will occur over an extended period of time  and we will not receive any material increases in revenues until after completion of the project 
furthermore  we may have only limited natural gas supplies committed to these facilities prior to their construction 
moreover  we may construct facilities to capture anticipated future growth in production in a region in which anticipated production growth does not materialize 
we may also rely on estimates of proved reserves in our decision to construct new pipelines and facilities  which may prove to be inaccurate because there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves 
as a result  new facilities may not be able to attract enough natural gas to achieve our expected investment return  which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
our substantial debt and other financial obligations could impair our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows  and our ability to fulfill our debt obligations 
we have substantial indebtedness and other financial obligations 
subject to the restrictions governing our indebtedness and other financial obligations  and the indenture governing our outstanding notes  we may incur significant additional indebtedness and other financial obligations 
our substantial indebtedness and other financial obligations could have important consequences 
for example  they could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our existing debt  impair our ability to obtain additional financings in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  or general corporate and other purposes  have a material adverse effect on us if we fail to comply with financial and restrictive covenants in our debt agreements  and an event of default occurs as a result of that failure that is not cured or waived  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to payments on our indebtedness and other financial obligations  thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures  distributions and other general partnership requirements  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have proportionately less debt 
furthermore  these consequences could limit our ability  and the ability of our subsidiaries  to obtain future financings  make needed capital expenditures  withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general  conduct operations or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities that may arise 
our existing credit facility contains covenants requiring us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial conditions 
we may be unable to meet those ratios and conditions 
any future breach of any of these covenants or our failure to meet any of these ratios or conditions could result in a default under the terms of our credit facility  which could result in acceleration of our debt and other financial obligations 
if we were unable to repay those amounts  the lenders could initiate a bankruptcy or liquidation proceeding  or proceed against the collateral 
a significant decrease in natural gas and refinery off gas supplies in our areas of operation  due to a decline in production from existing wells  refinery operations  depressed commodity prices  reduced drilling activities or other factors  could adversely affect our revenues and operating income and cash flow 
our profitability depends on the volume of natural gas we gather  transmit and process  and ngls we transport and fractionate at our facilities 
a decrease in natural gas or refinery off gas supplies in our areas of operation would result in a decline in the volume of natural gas delivered to our pipelines and facilities for gathering  transporting and processing  and ngls delivered to our pipelines and facilities for fractionation  storage  transportation and sale 
this would reduce our revenue and operating income 
fluctuations in energy prices can greatly affect production rates  and investments by third parties in the development of new oil and natural gas reserves 
drilling activity generally decreases as oil and natural gas prices decrease 
we have no control over the level of drilling activity in our areas of operations  the amount of reserves underlying the wells and the rate at which production from a well declines 
in addition  we have no control over producers or their production decisions  which are affected by  among other things prevailing and projected energy prices  demand for hydrocarbons  the level of reserves  geological considerations  governmental regulation  and the availability and cost of capital 
failure to connect new wells to our gathering systems would  therefore  result in a reduction of the amount of natural gas we gather  transmit and process  and the amount of ngls we transport and fractionate 
over time  as the current wells exhaust  this could cause us to abandon our gathering systems and  possibly  cease gathering operations 
as a consequence of such declines  our revenues would drop 
we depend on third parties for the natural gas and refinery off gas we process  and the ngls we fractionate at our facilities  and a reduction in these quantities could reduce our revenues and cash flow 
although we obtain our supply of natural gas  refinery off gas and ngls from numerous third party producers  a significant portion comes from a limited number of key producers suppliers who are committed to us under processing contracts 
according to these contracts or other supply arrangements  however  the producers are under no obligation to deliver a specific quantity of natural gas or ngls to our facilities 
if these key suppliers  or a significant number of other producers  were to decrease the supply of natural gas or ngls to our systems and facilities for any reason  we could experience difficulty in replacing those lost volumes 
because our operating costs are primarily fixed  a reduction in the volumes of natural gas or ngls delivered to us would result not only in a reduction of revenues  but also a decline in net income and cash flow of similar magnitude 
we derive a significant portion of our revenues from our gas processing  transportation  fractionation and storage agreements with markwest hydrocarbon  and its failure to satisfy its payment or other obligations under these agreements could reduce our revenues and cash flow 
markwest hydrocarbon accounts for a significant portion of our revenues and net operating margin 
these revenues and margins are generated by the volumes of natural gas contractually committed to markwest hydrocarbon by the appalachian producers described above  as well as the fees generated from processing  transportation  fractionation and storage services provided to markwest hydrocarbon 
we expect to derive a significant portion of our revenues and net operating margin from the services we provide under our contracts with markwest hydrocarbon for the foreseeable future 
any default or nonperformance by markwest hydrocarbon could significantly reduce our revenues and cash flows 
thus  any factor or event adversely affecting markwest hydrocarbon s business  creditworthiness or its ability to perform under its contracts with us  or its other contracts related to our business  could also adversely affect us 
the fees charged to third parties under our gathering  processing  transmission  transportation  fractionation and storage agreements may not escalate sufficiently to cover increases in costs 
the agreements may not be renewed or may be suspended in some circumstances 
our costs may increase at a rate greater than the fees we charge to third parties 
furthermore  third parties may not renew their contracts with us 
additionally  some third parties obligations under their agreements with us may be permanently or temporarily reduced due to certain events  some of which are beyond our control  including force majeure events wherein the supply of either natural gas  ngls or crude oil are curtailed or cut off 
force majeure events include but are not limited to revolutions  wars  acts of enemies  embargoes  import or export restrictions  strikes  lockouts  fires  storms  floods  acts of god  explosions  mechanical or physical failures of equipment or facilities of the partnership or third parties 
if the escalation of fees is insufficient to cover increased costs  if third parties do not renew or extend their contracts with us or if any third party suspends or terminates its contracts with us  our financial results would suffer 
we are exposed to the credit risk of our customers and counterparties  and a general increase in the nonpayment and nonperformance by our customers could reduce our revenues and cash flow 
we are diligent in attempting to ensure that we issue credit to only credit worthy customers 
even if our credit review and analysis mechanisms work properly  however  we may experience losses in dealing with operators and other parties 
any increase in the nonpayment and nonperformance by our customers could reduce our revenues and cash flow 
we may not be able to retain existing customers  or acquire new customers  which would reduce our revenues and limit our future profitability 
the renewal or replacement of existing contracts with our customers at rates sufficient to maintain current revenues and cash flows depends on a number of factors beyond our control  including competition from other gatherers  processors  pipelines  fractionators  and the price of  and demand for  natural gas  ngls and crude oil in the markets we serve 
our competitors include large oil  natural gas  refining and petrochemical companies  some of which have greater financial resources  more numerous or greater capacity pipelines  processing and other facilities  and greater access to natural gas and ngl supplies than we do 
additionally  our customers that gather gas through facilities that are not otherwise dedicated to us may develop their own processing and fractionation facilities in lieu of using our services 
certain of our competitors may also have advantages in competing for acquisitions  or other new business opportunities  because of their financial resources and synergies in operations 
as a consequence of the increase in competition in the industry  and the volatility of natural gas prices  end users and utilities are reluctant to enter into long term purchase contracts 
many end users purchase natural gas from more than one natural gas company and have the ability to change providers at any time 
some of these end users also have the ability to switch between gas and alternative fuels in response to relative price fluctuations in the market 
because there are numerous companies of greatly varying size and financial capacity that compete with us in the marketing of natural gas  we often compete in the end user and utilities markets primarily on the basis of price 
the inability of our management to renew or replace our current contracts as they expire and to respond appropriately to changing market conditions could affect our profitability 
for more information regarding our competition  please see industry overview  competition in item of part i of this report 
our profitability is affected by the volatility of ngl product and natural gas prices 
changes in the prices of ngl products have historically correlated closely with changes in the price of crude oil 
crude oil  ngl products and natural gas prices have been volatile in recent years in response to relatively minor changes in the supply and demand for ngl products and natural gas  market uncertainty  and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control  including the level of domestic oil  natural gas and ngl production  demand for natural gas and ngl products in localized markets  imports of crude oil  natural gas and ngls  seasonality  the condition of the us economy  political conditions in other oil producing and natural gas producing countries  and domestic government regulation  legislation and policies 
our net operating margins under many of our various types of commodity based contracts are directly affected by changes in ngl product prices and natural gas prices  thus are more sensitive to volatility in commodity prices than our fee based contracts 
additionally  our purchase and resale of gas in the ordinary course of business exposes us to significant risk of volatility in gas prices due to the potential difference in the time of the purchases and sales  and the existence of a difference in the gas price associated with each transaction 
finally  changes in natural gas prices may indirectly affect our profitability  since prices can influence drilling activity and well operations and  thus  the volume of gas we gather and process 
in the past  the prices of natural gas and ngls have been extremely volatile  and we expect this volatility to continue 
our commodity derivative activities may reduce our earnings  profitability and cash flows 
our operations expose us to fluctuations in commodity prices 
we utilize derivative financial instruments related to the future price of crude oil  natural gas and certain ngls with the intent of reducing volatility in our cash flows due to fluctuations in commodity prices 
we account for derivative instruments in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the extent of our commodity price exposure is related largely to the effectiveness and scope of our derivative activities 
we have a policy to enter into derivative transactions related to only a portion of the volume of our expected production or fuel requirements and  as a result  we will continue to have direct commodity price exposure to the unhedged portion 
please read management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
our actual future production or fuel requirements may be significantly higher or lower than we estimate at the time we enter into derivative transactions for such period 
if the actual amount is higher than we estimate  we will have greater commodity price exposure than we intended 
if the actual amount is lower than the amount that is subject to our derivative financial instruments  we might be forced to satisfy all or a portion of our derivative transactions without the benefit of the cash flow from our sale or purchase of the underlying physical commodity  resulting in a substantial diminution of our liquidity 
as a result of these factors  our hedging activities may not be as effective as we intend in reducing the volatility of our cash flows  and in certain circumstances may actually increase the volatility of our cash flows 
in addition  our hedging activities are subject to the risks that a counterparty may not perform its obligation under the applicable derivative instrument  the terms of the derivative instruments are imperfect  and our hedging policies and procedures are not properly followed 
it is possible that the steps we take to monitor our derivative financial instruments may not detect and prevent violations of our risk management policies and procedures  particularly if deception or other intentional misconduct is involved 
we have found material weaknesses in our internal controls that require remediation and concluded  pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act of  that our internal controls over financial reporting at december   were not effective 
as we discuss in our management s report on internal control over financial reporting in part ii  item a  controls and procedures  of this form k  we have discovered deficiencies  including material weaknesses  in our internal controls over financial reporting as of december  in particular  we identified  and deloitte touche s audit report on management s assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of december  confirmed the presence of  the following material weaknesses ineffective control environment  and risk management and accounting for derivative financial instruments 
we are fully committed to remediating the material weaknesses described above  and we believe that we are taking the steps that will properly address these issues 
further  our audit committee has been and expects to remain actively involved in the remediation planning and implementation 
however  the remediation of the design of the deficient controls and the associated testing efforts are not complete  and further remediation may be required 
while we are taking immediate steps and dedicating substantial resources to correct these material weaknesses  they will not be considered remediated until the new and improved internal controls operate for a period of time  are tested and are found to be operating effectively 
pending the successful completion of such testing and the hiring of additional personnel  we will perform mitigating procedures 
if we fail to remediate any material weaknesses  we could be unable to provide timely and reliable financial information  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
we are subject to operating and litigation risks that may not be covered by insurance 
our industry is subject to numerous operating hazards and risks incidental to processing  transporting  fractionating and storing natural gas and ngls  and to transporting and storing crude oil 
these include damage to pipelines  plants  related equipment and surrounding properties caused by floods and other natural disasters  inadvertent damage from construction and farm equipment  leakage of crude oil  natural gas  ngls and other hydrocarbons  fires and explosions  and other hazards  including those associated with high sulfur content  or sour gas  that could also result in personal injury and loss of life  pollution and suspension of operations 
as a result  we may be a defendant in various legal proceedings and litigation arising from our operations 
we may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates 
market conditions could cause certain insurance premiums and deductibles to become unavailable  or available only for reduced amounts of coverage 
for example  insurance carriers now require broad exclusions for losses due to war risk and terrorist acts 
if we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured  it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position 
transportation on certain of our pipelines may be subject to federal or state rate and service regulation  and the imposition and or cost of compliance with such regulation could adversely affect our profitability 
some of our gas  liquids and crude oil transmission operations are subject to rate and service regulations under ferc or various state regulatory bodies  depending upon jurisdiction 
ferc generally regulates the transportation of natural gas and oil in interstate commerce  and ferc s regulatory authority includes facilities construction  acquisition  extension or abandonment of services or facilities  accounts and records  and depreciation and amortization policies 
intrastate natural gas pipeline operations are generally not subject to regulation by ferc  and the natural gas act nga specifically exempts some gathering systems 
yet such operations may still be subject to regulation by various state agencies 
the applicable statutes and regulations generally require that our rates and terms and conditions of service provide no more than a fair return on the aggregate value of the facilities used to render services 
ferc rate cases can involve complex and expensive proceedings 
for more information regarding regulatory matters that could affect our business  please see item  regulatory matters 
we are indemnified for liabilities arising from an ongoing remediation of property on which our facilities are located and our results of operation and our ability to make payments of principal and interest on the notes could be adversely affected if the indemnifying party fails to perform its indemnification obligation 
columbia gas is the previous or current owner of the property on which our kenova  boldman  cobb and kermit facilities are located and is the previous operator of our boldman and cobb facilities 
columbia gas has been or is currently involved in investigatory or remedial activities with respect to the real property underlying the boldman and cobb facilities pursuant to an administrative order by consent for removal actions entered into by columbia gas and the us environmental protection agency and  in the case of the boldman facility  an agreed order with the kentucky natural resources and environmental protection cabinet 
columbia gas has agreed to retain sole liability and responsibility for  and to indemnify markwest hydrocarbon against  any environmental liabilities associated with these regulatory orders or the real property underlying these facilities to the extent such liabilities arose prior to the effective date of the agreements pursuant to which such properties were acquired or leased from columbia gas 
at the closing of our initial public offering  markwest hydrocarbon assigned us the benefit of its indemnity from columbia gas with respect to the cobb  boldman and kermit facilities 
while we are not a party to the agreement under which columbia gas agreed to indemnify markwest hydrocarbon with respect to the kenova facility  markwest hydrocarbon has agreed to provide to us the benefit of its indemnity  as well as any other third party environmental indemnity of which it is a beneficiary 
markwest hydrocarbon has also agreed to provide us an additional environmental indemnity pursuant to the terms of the omnibus agreement 
our results of operation and our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders could be adversely affected if in the future either columbia gas or markwest hydrocarbon fails to perform under the indemnification provisions of which we are the beneficiary 
our business is subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations with respect to environmental  safety and other regulatory matters  and the violation of  or the cost of compliance with  such laws and regulations could adversely affect our profitability 
numerous governmental agencies enforce complex and stringent laws and regulations on a wide range of environmental  safety and other regulatory matters 
we could be adversely affected by increased costs due to stricter pollution control requirements or liabilities resulting from non compliance with operating or other regulatory permits 
new environmental laws and regulations might adversely influence our products and activities 
federal  state and local agencies also could impose additional safety requirements  any of which could affect our profitability 
in addition  we face the risk of accidental releases or spills associated with our operations 
these could result in material costs and liabilities  including those relating to claims for damages to property and persons 
our failure to comply with environmental or safety related laws and regulations could result in administrative  civil and criminal penalties  the imposition of investigatory and remedial obligations and even injunctions that restrict or prohibit our operations 
for more information regarding the environmental  safety and other regulatory matters that could affect our business  please see item  regulatory matters  environmental matters  and pipeline safety regulations 
the amount of gas we process  gather and transmit  or the crude oil we gather and transport  may be reduced if the pipelines to which we deliver the natural gas or crude oil cannot  or will not  accept the gas or crude oil 
all of the natural gas we process  gather and transmit is delivered into pipelines for further delivery to end users 
if these pipelines cannot  or will not  accept delivery of the gas due to downstream constraints on the pipeline  we will be forced to limit or stop the flow of gas through our pipelines and processing systems 
in addition  interruption of pipeline service upstream of our processing facilities would likewise limit or stop flow through our processing facilities 
likewise  if the pipelines into which we deliver crude oil are interrupted  we will be limited in  or prevented from conducting  our crude oil transportation operations 
any number of factors beyond our control could cause such interruptions or constraints on pipeline service  including necessary and scheduled maintenance  or unexpected damage to the pipeline 
because our revenues and net operating margins depend upon the volumes of natural gas we process  gather and transmit  the throughput of ngls through our transportation  fractionation and storage facilities and the volume of crude oil we gather and transport  any reduction of volumes could result in a material reduction in our net operating margin 
our business would be adversely affected if operations at any of our facilities were interrupted 
our operations depend upon the infrastructure that we have developed  including processing and fractionation plants  storage facilities  and various means of transportation 
any significant interruption at these facilities or pipelines  or our inability to transmit natural gas or ngls  or transport crude oil to or from these facilities or pipelines for any reason  would adversely affect our results of operations 
operations at our facilities could be partially or completely shut down  temporarily or permanently  as the result of circumstances not within our control  such as unscheduled turnarounds or catastrophic events at our physical plants  labor difficulties that result in a work stoppage or slowdown  and a disruption in the supply of crude oil to our crude oil pipeline  natural gas to our processing plants or gathering pipelines  or a disruption in the supply of ngls to our transportation pipeline and fractionation facility 
due to our lack of asset diversification  adverse developments in our gathering  processing  transportation  transmission  fractionation and storage businesses would reduce our ability to make distributions to our unitholders 
we rely exclusively on the revenues generated from our gathering  processing  transportation  transmission  fractionation and storage businesses 
an adverse development in one of these businesses would have a significantly greater impact on our financial condition and results of operations than if we maintained more diverse assets 
a shortage of skilled labor may make it difficult for us to maintain labor productivity  and competitive costs and could adversely affect our profitability 
our operations require skilled and experienced laborers with proficiency in multiple tasks 
in recent years  a shortage of workers trained in various skills associated with the midstream energy business has caused us to conduct certain operations without full staff  which decreases our productivity and increases our costs 
this shortage of trained workers is the result of the previous generation s experienced workers reaching the age for retirement  combined with the difficulty of attracting new laborers to the midstream energy industry 
thus  this shortage of skilled labor could continue over an extended period 
if the shortage of experienced labor continues or worsens  it could have an adverse impact on our labor productivity and costs and our ability to expand production in the event there is an increase in the demand for our products and services  which could adversely affect our profitability 
risks related to our partnership structure cost reimbursements and fees due our general partner may be substantial and reduce our cash available for distribution to unitholders 
prior to making any distribution on the common units  we reimburse our general partner for all expenses it incurs on our behalf 
our general partner has sole discretion in determining the amount of these expenses 
our general partner and its affiliates also may provide us other services for which we will be charged fees 
markwest hydrocarbon and its affiliates have conflicts of interest and limited fiduciary responsibilities  which may permit them to favor their own interests to the detriment of the unitholders markwest hydrocarbon and its affiliates own and control our general partner 
markwest hydrocarbon and its affiliates also own a significant limited partner interest in us 
a number of officers and employees of markwest hydrocarbon and our general partner also own interests in the partnership 
conflicts of interest may arise between markwest hydrocarbon and its affiliates  including our general partner and the partnership 
as a result of these conflicts  our general partner may favor its own interests  and the interests of its affiliates  over the interests of our unitholders 
these conflicts include  among others  the following situations conflicts relating to control employees of markwest hydrocarbon who provide services to us also devote significant time to the businesses of markwest hydrocarbon and are compensated by markwest hydrocarbon for these services 
neither our partnership agreement nor any other agreement requires markwest hydrocarbon to pursue a future business strategy that favors the partnership or utilizes the partnership s assets for processing  transportation or fractionation services we provide 
markwest hydrocarbon s directors and officers have a fiduciary duty to make these decisions in the best interests of the stockholders of markwest hydrocarbon 
our general partner is allowed to take into account the interests of other parties  such as markwest hydrocarbon  in resolving conflicts of interest  which has the effect of limiting its fiduciary duty to our unitholders 
our general partner may limit its liability and reduce its fiduciary duties  while also restricting the remedies available to our unitholders for actions that  without the limitations  might constitute breaches of fiduciary duty 
as a result of purchasing units  our unitholders consent to some actions and conflicts of interest that might otherwise constitute a breach of fiduciary or other duties under applicable state law 
our general partner controls the enforcement of obligations owed to the partnership by our general partner and its affiliates  including the processing  transportation and fractionation agreements with markwest hydrocarbon 
our general partner decides whether to retain separate counsel  accountants or others to perform services for the partnership 
in some instances  our general partner may cause us to borrow funds in order to make cash distributions  even if the purpose or effect of the borrowing is to make a distribution on the subordinated units or to make incentive distributions or to hasten the conversion of subordinated units 
our partnership agreement gives our general partner broad discretion in establishing financial reserves for the proper conduct of our business 
these reserves also will affect the amount of cash available for distribution 
our general partner may establish reserves for distribution on the subordinated units  but only if those reserves will not prevent us from distributing the full minimum quarterly distribution  plus any arrearages  on the common units for the following four quarters 
conflicts relating to costs our general partner determines the amount and timing of asset purchases and sales  capital expenditures  borrowings  issuance of additional partnership securities and reserves  each of which can affect the amount of cash that is distributed to our unitholders 
our general partner determines which costs incurred by markwest hydrocarbon and its affiliates are reimbursable by us 
our partnership agreement does not restrict our general partner from causing us to pay it or its affiliates for any services rendered on terms that are fair and reasonable to us or entering into additional contractual arrangements with any of these entities on our behalf 
unitholders have less ability to elect or remove management than holders of common stock in a corporation 
unlike the holders of common stock in a corporation  unitholders have only limited voting rights on matters affecting our business  and therefore limited ability to influence management s decisions regarding our business 
unitholders did not elect our general partner or its board of directors  and have no right to elect our general partner or its board of directors on an annual or other continuing basis 
markwest hydrocarbon and its affiliates choose the board of directors of our general partner 
the directors of our general partner also have a fiduciary duty to manage our general partner in a manner beneficial to its members  markwest hydrocarbon and its affiliates 
furthermore  if unitholders are dissatisfied with the performance of our general partner  they have little ability to remove our general partner 
first  our general partner generally may not be removed except upon the vote of the holders of at least of the outstanding units voting together as a single class 
also  if our general partner is removed without cause during the subordination period  and units held by markwest hydrocarbon and its affiliates are not voted in favor of that removal  all remaining subordinated units will automatically be converted into common units  and any existing arrearages on the common units will be extinguished 
a removal under these circumstances would adversely affect the common unitholders by prematurely eliminating their contractual right to distributions over the subordinated units  which would otherwise have continued until we had met certain distribution and performance tests 
cause is narrowly defined to mean that a court of competent jurisdiction has entered a final  non appealable judgment finding our general partner liable for actual fraud  gross negligence  or willful or wanton misconduct in its capacity as our general partner 
cause does not include most cases of charges of poor management of the business  so the removal of our general partner because of the unitholders dissatisfaction with its performance in managing our partnership will most likely result in the termination of the subordination period 
unitholders voting rights are restricted by the partnership agreement provision 
it states that any units held by a person who owns or more of any class of units then outstanding  other than our general partner  its affiliates  their transferees and persons who acquired such units with the prior approval of the board of directors of our general partner  cannot be voted on any matter 
in addition  the partnership agreement contains provisions limiting the ability of unitholders to call meetings or to acquire information about our operations  as well as other provisions limiting the unitholders ability to influence the manner or direction of management 
these provisions may discourage a person or group from attempting to remove our general partner or otherwise change our management 
as a result of these provisions  the price at which the common units will trade may be lower because of the absence or reduction of a takeover premium in the trading price 
the control of our general partner may be transferred to a third party  and that party could replace our current management team  in each case without unitholder consent 
our general partner may transfer its general partner interest to a third party in a merger  or in a sale of all or substantially all of its assets  without the consent of the unitholders 
furthermore  there is no restriction in the partnership agreement on the ability of the owners of our general partner from transferring their ownership interest in our general partner to a third party 
the new owner of our general partner would then be in a position to replace the board of directors and officers of our general partner with its own choices  and to control the decisions taken by the board of directors and officers 
our general partner s absolute discretion in determining the level of cash reserves may adversely affect our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders 
our partnership agreement requires our general partner to deduct from operating surplus cash reserves that  in its reasonable discretion  are necessary to fund our future operating expenditures 
in addition  the partnership agreement permits our general partner to reduce available cash by establishing cash reserves for the proper conduct of our business  to comply with applicable law or agreements to which we are a party  or to provide funds for future distributions to partners 
these cash reserves will affect the amount of cash available for distribution to our unitholders 
our partnership agreement contains provisions that reduce the remedies available to unitholders for actions that might otherwise constitute a breach of fiduciary duty by our general partner 
our partnership agreement limits the liability and reduces the fiduciary duties of our general partner to our unitholders 
the partnership agreement also restricts the remedies available to unitholders for actions that would otherwise constitute breaches of our general partner s fiduciary duties 
if you hold common units  you will be treated as having consented to the various actions contemplated in the partnership agreement and conflicts of interest that might otherwise be considered a breach of fiduciary duties under applicable state law 
we do not have any employees and rely solely on employees of markwest hydrocarbon and its affiliates who serve as our agents 
markwest hydrocarbon and its affiliates conduct businesses and activities of their own in which we have no economic interest 
if these separate activities are significantly greater than our activities  there could be material competition for the time and effort of the employees who provide services to our general partner 
if the employees of markwest hydrocarbon and its affiliates do not devote sufficient attention to the management and operation of our business  our financial results may suffer  and our ability to make distributions to our unitholders may be reduced 
we may issue additional common units without your approval  which would dilute your ownership interests 
during the subordination period  our general partner  without the approval of our unitholders  may cause the partnership to issue up to  additional common units 
our general partner  without unitholder approval  may also cause the partnership to issue an unlimited number of additional common units or other equity securities of equal rank with the common units  in several circumstances 
these include the issuance of common units in connection with acquisitions or capital improvements that increase cash flow from operations per unit on a pro forma basis  the conversion of subordinated units into common units  the conversion of units of equal rank with the common units into common units under some circumstances  the conversion of the general partner interest and the incentive distribution rights into common units as a result of the withdrawal of our general partner  issuances of common units under our long term incentive plan  or issuances of common units to repay indebtedness  the cost of servicing which is greater than the distribution obligations associated with the units issued in connection with the debt s retirement 
the issuance of additional common units or other equity securities of equal or senior rank will have the following effects our unitholders proportionate ownership interest in the partnership will decrease  the amount of cash available for distribution on each unit may decrease  because a lower percentage of total outstanding units will be subordinated units  the risk that a shortfall in the payment of the minimum quarterly distribution will be borne by our common unitholders will increase  the relative voting strength of each previously outstanding unit may be diminished  and the market price of the common units may decline 
after the end of the subordination period  we may issue an unlimited number of limited partner interests of any type without the approval of our unitholders 
our partnership agreement does not give our unitholders the right to approve our issuance of equity securities ranking junior to the common units at any time 
our general partner has a limited call right that may require you to sell your common units at an undesirable time or price 
if at any time more than of the outstanding common units are owned by our general partner and its affiliates  our general partner will have the right  but not the obligation  which it may assign to any of its affiliates or to the partnership  to acquire all  but not less than all  of the remaining common units held by unaffiliated persons at a price not less than their then current market price 
as a result  you may be required to sell your common units at an undesirable time or price and may not receive any return on your investment 
you may also incur a tax liability upon a sale of your units 
you may not have limited liability if a court finds that unitholder action constitutes control of our business 
under delaware law  you could be held liable for our obligations as a general partner if a court determined that the right or the exercise of the right by our unitholders as a group to remove or replace our general partner  to approve some amendments to the partnership agreement  or to take other action under our partnership agreement was considered participation in the control of our business 
our general partner usually has unlimited liability for the obligations of the partnership  such as its debts and environmental liabilities  except for those contractual obligations of the partnership that are expressly made without recourse to our general partner 
in addition  section of the delaware revised uniform limited partnership act provides that  under some circumstances  a unitholder may be liable to us for the amount of a distribution for a period of three years from the date of the distribution

item legal proceedings markwest energy partners  in the ordinary course of business  is subject to a variety of risks and disputes normally incident to its business  a defendant in various lawsuits and a party to various other legal proceedings 
we maintain insurance policies with insurers in amounts and with coverage and deductibles as we believe are reasonable and prudent 
we cannot assure  however  that the insurance companies will promptly honor their policy obligations or that the coverage or levels of insurance will be adequate to protect us from all material expenses related to potential future claims for property loss or business interruption to the partnership or for third party claims of personal and property damage  or that the coverage or levels of insurance it presently has will be available in the future at economical prices 
in early  the partnership and several of its affiliates were served with two lawsuits  ricky j

markwest hydrocarbon  inc et al 
filed february  
and charles c 
reid  et al 
v 
markwest hydrocarbon  inc et al  filed february   presently removed to and under the jurisdiction of the us district court for the eastern district of kentucky  pikeville division 
the partnership was served with an additional lawsuit  community trust and investment co  et al 
v 
markwest hydrocarbon  inc et al  filed november  in floyd county circuit court  kentucky  that added five new claimants but essentially alleged the same facts and claims as the earlier two suits 
these actions are for third party claims of property and personal injury damages sustained as a consequence of an ngl pipeline leak and an ensuing explosion and fire that occurred on november  the pipeline was owned by an unrelated business entity and leased and operated by the partnership s subsidiary  markwest energy appalachia  llc 
it transports ngls from the maytown gas processing plant to the partnership s siloam fractionator 
the fire from the leaked vapors resulted in property damage to five homes and injuries to some of the residents 
the pipeline owner  the us department of transportation  office of pipeline safety ops  and the partnership continue to investigate the incident 
the partnership notified its general liability insurance carriers of the incident and of the filed kentucky actions in a timely manner and is coordinating the defense of these third party lawsuits with the insurers 
at this time  the partnership believes that it has adequate general liability insurance coverage for third party property damage and personal injury liability resulting from the incident 
to date  the partnership has settled with several of the claimants for third party property damage claims damage to residences and personal property  in addition to reaching settlement for some of the personal injury claims 
these settlements have been paid for or reimbursed under the partnership s general liability insurance 
as a result  the partnership has not provided for a loss contingency 
pursuant to ops regulation mandates and to a corrective action order issued by the ops on november   pipeline and valve integrity evaluation  testing and repairs were conducted on the affected pipeline segment before service could be resumed 
based on  among other things  the successful integrity testing of the affected pipeline  ops authorized a partial return to service of the affected pipeline in october markwest is currently preparing its application for return to full service 
the partnership has filed an independent action captioned markwest hydrocarbon  inc  et al

cv filed august   as removed to the us district court for the district of colorado  civil action no 
cv  on october   against its all risks property and business interruption insurance carriers as a result of the insurance companies refusal to honor their insurance coverage obligation to pay the partnership for certain expenses 
these include the partnership s internal expenses and costs incurred for damage to  and loss of use of the pipeline  equipment  products  the extra transportation costs incurred for transporting the liquids while the pipeline was out of service  the reduced volumes of liquids that could be processed  and the costs of complying with the ops corrective action order hydrostatic testing  repair replacement and other pipeline integrity assurance measures 
these expenses and costs have been expensed as incurred and any potential recovery from the all risks property and business interruption insurance carriers will be treated as other income if and when they are received 
the partnership has not provided for a receivable for these claims because of the uncertainty as to whether and how much the partnership will ultimately recover under these policies 
the partnership has also asserted that the cost of pipeline testing  replacement and repair are subject to an equitable sharing arrangement with the pipeline owner  pursuant to the terms of the pipeline lease agreement 
on september   a lawsuit captioned cf qualia operating  inc v

under the gas purchase agreement  markwest energy partners paid the plaintiff based on volumes of gas measured at the wellhead delivery point 
plaintiff claims that it is entitled to a prorated portion of any system gain  ie  that is to be paid for more gas than it actually sold and delivered to the partnership 
markwest energy partners has filed an answer to the complaint denying plaintiff s allegations and has asserted a counter claim for declaratory judgment on the contract terms as being clear and unambiguous as to payment being limited to those measured at the wellhead  that plaintiff s claims are without merit  and that markwest also may have overpaid plaintiff based on  among other things  the wet versus dry btu measurements 
discovery has just begun  and at this time  the partnership is not able to predict the ultimate outcome of this matter 
as a result  the partnership has not provided for a loss contingency

the hipolito gonzales action is subject to a settlement in principle reached in a mediation held december  the partnership s involvement and engagement in the other cases has been limited to this point  but the actions have been and are being vigorously defended and  based on initial evaluation and consultations  it appears at this time that these actions should not have a material impact on the partnership 
in response to a shipper inquiry to the federal energy regulatory commission ferc regarding the partnership s michigan crude pipeline  and following unsuccessful ferc requested rate structure discussions with the shippers  ferc recently requested that we file a tariff 
the partnership filed on november  a tariff with ferc establishing a cost of service rate structure to be effective starting january  two shippers and a producer filed a joint protest to the ferc filing with the commission  and the partnership filed a response to this joint protest vigorously defending its filing and opposing the protest 
the commission issued an order on december   rejecting the protestor s request for interim rates and accepting the partnership s filing  and the new rates and rate structure became effective january  the commission established hearing procedures for the tariff filing  but held them in abeyance pending the outcome of ferc sponsored settlement discussions  which the parties have been referred to under the ferc procedures 
the partnership and the shippers subsequently negotiated a settlement  that resulted in the partnership filing a new tariff which  for the most part  returns the rates to those in effect prior to the effective date of the november  tariff filing  and established such rates for a prospective three year period

available cash is defined in our partnership agreement  and generally consists of all cash and cash equivalents of the partnership on hand at the end of each quarter  less reserves established by the general partner for future requirements  plus all cash on the date of determination of available cash for the quarter resulting from working capital borrowings made after the end of the quarter 
the general partner has the discretion to establish cash reserves that are necessary  or appropriate  to i provide for the proper conduct of our business  ii comply with applicable law  any of our debt instruments or other agreements  or iii provide funds for distributions to unitholders and the general partner for any one or more of the next four quarters 
distributions of available cash during the subordination period during the subordination period as defined in the partnership agreement and discussed further below  our quarterly distributions of available cash will be made in the following manner first  to the common unitholders and to our general partner  until each common unitholder has received a minimum quarterly distribution of  plus any arrearages from prior quarters 
second  to the subordinated unitholders and to our general partner  until each subordinated unitholder has received a minimum quarterly distribution of  plus any arrearages from prior quarters 
third  to all unitholders  pro rata  and to our general partner  until each unitholder has received a distribution of per quarter 
thereafter  in the manner described in incentive distribution rights below 
distributions of available cash after the subordination period we will make distributions of available cash for any quarter after the subordination period in the following manner first  to all unitholders  pro rata  and to our general partner  until we distribute for each outstanding unit an amount equal to the minimum quarterly distribution for that quarter  and thereafter  in the manner described in incentive distribution rights below 
incentive distribution rights incentive distribution rights represent the right to receive an increasing percentage of quarterly distributions of available cash after the minimum quarterly distribution and the target distribution levels  as described below  have been achieved 
our general partner holds the incentive distribution rights  but may transfer these rights separately from its general partner interest  subject to restrictions in the partnership agreement 
if for any quarter we have distributed available cash to the common and subordinated unitholders in an amount equal to the minimum quarterly distribution  and we have distributed available cash on outstanding common units in an amount necessary to eliminate any cumulative arrearages in payment of the minimum quarterly distribution  then  we will distribute any additional available cash for that quarter among the unitholders and our general partner in the following manner first  to all unitholders  pro rata  and to our general partner until each unitholder receives a total of per unit for that quarter the first target distribution  second  to all unitholders  pro rata  and to our general partner  until each unitholder receives a total of per unit for that quarter the second target distribution  third  to all unitholders  pro rata  and to our general partner  until each unitholder receives a total of per unit for that quarter the third target distribution  and thereafter  to all unitholders  pro rata  and to our general partner 
in each case  the amount of the target distribution set forth above is exclusive of any distributions to common unitholders  to eliminate any cumulative arrearages in payment of the minimum quarterly distribution 
we are currently distributing in excess of per unit per quarter 
there is no guarantee that we will pay the minimum quarterly distribution on the common units in any quarter  and we are prohibited from making any distributions to unitholders if it would cause an event of default under our credit facility 
the subordination period generally will not end earlier than june  a portion of the subordinated units  however  may be converted into common units at an earlier date on a one for one basis based upon the achievement of certain financial goals defined in the partnership agreement

these statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors 
overview we reported net income of million for the year ended december   or per diluted limited partner unit  compared to net income of million  or per diluted limited partner unit  for the year ended december  this decrease in net income compared to was primarily attributed to expenses incurred in our testing and repair program on the appalachian liquids pipeline system alps  as well as additional trucking costs for moving product while the line was out of service  which was approximately million higher than decreased liquids fractionation in appalachia  primarily due to alps being out of service and upstream interruptible customer curtailments in increased sg a expense related to ongoing audit and compliance requirements and non cash compensation expense 
reduced throughput volumes on our systems in michigan 
higher interest expense related to increased borrowing to fund acquisitions 
these items were partially offset by the following improved gathering volumes on our carthage  appleby and western oklahoma systems compared to the prior year 
improved processing margins relative to the prior year 
higher ngl and gas prices on our equity gallons and volumes 
on january   the board of directors of the general partner of the partnership declared the partnership s quarterly cash distribution of per unit for the fourth quarter of the fourth quarter distribution was paid on february   to unitholders of record on february  impact of recent acquisitions on comparability of financial results in reviewing our historical results of operations  you should be aware of the impact of our recent acquisitions  which fundamentally affect the comparability of our results of operations over the periods discussed 
since our initial public offering  we have completed eight acquisitions for an aggregate purchase price of million  net of working capital 
four of these acquisitions occurred in and their results are included in the results of operations from the acquisition date 
the pinnacle acquisition closed on march   for consideration of million 
the lubbock pipeline acquisition also known as the power tex lateral pipeline closed september   for consideration of million 
the western oklahoma acquisition closed december   for consideration of million 
the michigan crude pipeline acquisition closed december   for consideration of million 
two acquisitions occurred in and their results are included in the results of operations from the acquisition date 
the hobbs acquisition closed april   for consideration of million 
as a result  only nine months of activity for hobbs is reflected in the results of operations for the year ended december  the east texas acquisition closed on july   for consideration of million  so only five months of activity for east texas is reflected in the results of operations for the year ended december  two acquisitions occurred in and are included in the results of operations from the acquisition date

as a result  only two months of activity for javelina is reflected in the results of operations for the year ended december  our relationship with markwest hydrocarbon  inc we were formed by markwest hydrocarbon to acquire most of its natural gas gathering and processing assets  and ngl transportation  fractionation and storage assets 
markwest hydrocarbon remains one of our largest customers 
for the year ended december   it accounted for of our revenues and of our net operating margin 
this represents a decrease from the year ended december   when markwest hydrocarbon accounted for of our revenues and of our net operating margin 
we expect to continue deriving a significant portion of our revenues from the services we provide under our contracts with markwest hydrocarbon for the foreseeable future  however  as our other operations grow  the relative contribution from markwest hydrocarbon will continue to decline 
at december   markwest hydrocarbon and its subsidiaries  in the aggregate  owned a interest in the partnership  consisting of  subordinated limited partner units  which represents a interest in the partnership   common partner units  which represents interest  and of the general partner  which owns a interest in the partnership and associated incentive distribution rights 
under a services agreement  markwest hydrocarbon acts in a management capacity rendering day to day operational  business and asset management  accounting  personnel and related administrative services to the partnership 
in return  the partnership reimburses markwest hydrocarbon for all expenses incurred on behalf of the partnership

amortization of deferred financing costs increased in relative to due to the debt re financings completed in and the deferred financing costs associated with the issuance of the senior notes 
during  we amortized approximately million of deferred financing costs related to debt issuance costs incurred to finance our acquisitions 
of that  million represented accelerated amortization due to the refinancing of our credit facility in july and again in october deferred financing costs are being amortized over the estimated term of the related obligations  which approximates the effective interest method 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity  to meet operating expenses and fund capital expenditures other than for certain acquisitions  are cash flows generated by our operations  and our access to equity and debt markets 
the equity and debt markets  public and private  retail and institutional  have been our principal source of capital used to finance a significant amount of our growth  including acquisitions 
during the first quarter of  we borrowed million from our credit facility to finance the starfish acquisition 
in the fourth quarter of  the million javelina acquisition and then existing borrowings  were financed with an interim bridge credit facility that was subsequently replaced by a new long term credit facility  as described below 
during the year ended december   we spent million on capital expenditures  primarily for the construction of a new processing plant and gathering systems in east texas to handle our future contractual commitments  and construction of the new replacement cobb processing facility in appalachia 
during  we borrowed approximately million  primarily to finance our acquisitions 
we received approximately million in proceeds from a private placement of common units  which was used to pay down our credit facility 
on december   markwest energy operating company  llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of markwest energy partners lp  entered into the fifth amended and restated credit agreement partnership credit facility  which provides for a maximum lending limit of million for a five year term 
the credit facility includes a revolving facility of million and a million term loan  which can be repaid at any time without penalty 
under certain circumstances  the partnership credit facility can be increased from million up to million 
the credit facility is guaranteed by the partnership and all of the partnership s subsidiaries and is collateralized by substantially all of the partnership s assets and those of its subsidiaries 
the borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at a variable interest rate  plus basis points 
the variable interest rate is typically based on the london inter bank offering rate libor  however  in certain borrowing circumstances the rate would be based on the higher of a the federal funds rate plus  and b a rate set by the facility s administrative agent  based on the us prime rate 
the basis points correspond to the ratio of the partnership s consolidated senior debt as defined in the partnership credit facility to consolidated ebitda as defined in the partnership credit facility  ranging from to for base rate loans  and to for eurodollar rate loans 
the basis points will increase by during any period not to exceed days where the partnership makes an acquisition for a purchase price in excess of million acquisition adjustment period 
borrowings under the partnership credit facility were used to finance  in part  the javelina acquisition discussed above 
on december   the available borrowing capacity under the partnership credit facility was million 
under the provisions of the partnership credit facility  the partnership is subject to a number of restrictions on its business  including restrictions on its ability to grant liens on assets  make or own certain investments  enter into any swap contracts other than in the ordinary course of business  merge  consolidate or sell assets  incur indebtedness other than subordinated indebtedness  make distributions on equity investments  and declare or make  directly or indirectly  any restricted payments 
at december   the partnership and its subsidiary  markwest energy finance corporation  also have million in senior notes outstanding  at a fixed rate of 
the notes mature on november  the proceeds from these notes were used to pay down our outstanding debt under our credit facility in october subject to compliance with certain covenants  we may issue additional notes from time to time under the indenture pursuant to rule a and regulation s under the securities act of the indenture governing the senior notes limits the activity of the partnership and its restricted subsidiaries 
the provisions of such indenture places limits on the ability of the partnership and its restricted subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness  declare or pay dividends or distributions or redeem  repurchase or retire equity interests or subordinated indebtedness  make investments  incur liens  create any consensual limitation on the ability of the partnership s restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends  make loans or transfer property to the partnership  engage in transactions with the partnership s affiliates  sell assets  including equity interests of the partnership s subsidiaries  make any payment on or with respect to  or purchase  redeem  defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value any subordinated obligation or guarantor subordination obligation except principal and interest at maturity  and consolidate  merge or transfer assets 
the partnership agreed to file an exchange offer registration statement  or under certain circumstances  a shelf registration statement  pursuant to a registration rights agreement relating to the senior notes 
the partnership failed to complete the exchange offer in the time provided for in the subscription agreements april  and  as a consequence  is incurring an interest rate penalty of  increasing every days thereafter up to  until such time as the exchange offer is completed 
the partnership is currently being charged an interest rate penalty of 
the registration statement was filed on january   and the interest penalty ceased on march  cash generated from operations  borrowings under our credit facility and funds from our private and public equity offerings are our primary sources of liquidity 
the timing of our efforts to raise equity in the future  however  will be influenced by our inability to timely file our annual report on form k for the year ended december   and our quarterly report on form q for the quarter ending march  should we choose to raise capital through a public offering with the sec  we will not have the ability to incorporate by reference information from our future filings into a new registration statement until october  if we raise additional capital through public debt or equity offerings  we are required to file a form s  which is a long form type of registration statement 
the requirement to file a form s registration statement may affect our ability to access the capital markets on a timely basis and may increase the costs of doing so 
we believe  nonetheless  that funds from raising equity  together with cash generated from operations and borrowings under our credit facility  will be sufficient to meet both our short term and long term working capital requirements and anticipated capital expenditures 
funding of additional acquisitions will likely require the issuance of additional common units  the expansion of our credit facility  or both 
our ability to pay distributions to our unitholders and to fund planned capital expenditures and make acquisitions will depend upon our future operating performance 
that  in turn  will be affected by prevailing economic conditions in our industry  as well as financial  business and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
one of our largest customers is markwest hydrocarbon 
consequently  matters affecting the business and financial condition of markwest hydrocarbon including its operations  management  customers  vendors  and the like could affect our liquidity 
the partnership has budgeted million for capital expenditures in  exclusive of any acquisitions  consisting of million for expansion capital and million for sustaining capital 
expansion capital includes expenditures made to expand or increase the efficiency of the existing operating capacity of our assets  or facilitate an increase in volumes within our operations  whether through construction or acquisition 
sustaining capital includes expenditures to replace partially or fully depreciated assets in order to extend their useful lives 
cash flow december  in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities net cash provided by operating activities decreased less than million during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the decrease was impacted by a decrease in net income  offset by an increase in certain non cash operating expenses  primarily depreciation and amortization for a full year from our east texas acquisition  and two months from our november acquisition of javelina 
we expect that  overall  our volumes will be higher than in  and that cash provided by operating activities in will exceed levels 
a precipitous decline in natural gas  ngl or crude oil prices or volumes  however  could significantly affect the amount of cash flow that would be generated from operations 
net cash used in investing activities was higher during the year ended december   than during the year ended december   primarily due to our million investment in a non operating interest in starfish and our million acquisition of javelina in november in july  we acquired east texas for million 
the partnership used cash of million for capital expenditures in  primarily for the construction of a new processing plant and gathering systems in east texas to handle our future contractual commitments and construction of the new replacement cobb processing facility in appalachia 
in  the partnership used cash of million for capital expenditures 
net cash provided by financing activities increased million during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the increase was due primarily to net proceeds from additional long term debt and private placements to fund our acquisitions 
distributions to unitholders increased to million in  from million in total contractual cash obligations a summary of our total contractual cash obligations as of december   is as follows  in thousands payment due by period type of obligation total obligation due in due in due in thereafter long term debt operating leases purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations off balance sheet arrangements other than facility and equipment leasing arrangements  the partnership does not engage in off balance sheet financing activities 
matters influencing future results we earn fees for transporting  fractionating and selling the ngls recovered from the kenova  maytown  and boldman plants to siloam via our appalachian pipeline 
in november  a leak and ensuing explosion and fire occurred on a leased section of this pipeline 
the company and several of its affiliates were served in early with two lawsuits presently under the jurisdiction of the us district court for the eastern district of kentucky  pikeville division 
in early november  we were served with an additional lawsuit filed in floyd county circuit court  kentucky  adding five new claimants  but essentially alleging the same facts and claims as the earlier two suits 
these suits are for third party claims of property and personal injury damages sustained as a consequence of the explosion and fire 
the partnership has timely notified its general liability insurance carriers of the incident and of the filed kentucky actions and is coordinating the defense of these third party lawsuits with the insurers 
while investigation into the incident continues  at this time the partnership believes that it has adequate general liability insurance coverage for third party property damage and personal injury liability 
the partnership has settled with several of the claimants for property damage claims damage to residences and personal property  in addition to reaching settlement for some of the personal injury claims related to the incident 
these settlements have been paid for or reimbursed under the partnership s general liability insurance 
as a result  the partnership has not provided for a loss contingency 
pursuant to ops regulation mandates and to a corrective action order issued by the ops on november   pipeline and valve integrity evaluation  testing and repairs were conducted on the affected pipeline segment before service could be resumed 
based on  among other things  the successful integrity testing of the affected pipeline  ops authorized a partial return to service of the affected pipeline in october markwest is currently preparing its application for return to full service 
the partnership has filed an independent action captioned markwest hydrocarbon  inc  et al 
v 
liberty mutual ins

district court  arapahoe county  colorado  case no 
cv filed august   as removed to the us district court for the district of colorado  civil action no 
cv  on october   against its all risks property and business interruption insurance carriers as a result of the insurance companies refusal to honor their insurance coverage obligation to pay the partnership for certain expenses 
these include the partnership s internal expenses and costs incurred for damage to  and loss of use of the pipeline  equipment  products  the extra transportation costs incurred for transporting the liquids while the pipeline was out of service  the reduced volumes of liquids that could be processed  and the costs of complying with the ops corrective action order hydrostatic testing  repair replacement and other pipeline integrity assurance measures 
these expenses and costs have been expensed as incurred and any potential recovery from the all risks property and business interruption insurance carriers will be treated as other income if and when they are received 
the partnership has not provided for a receivable for these claims because of the uncertainty as to whether and how much the partnership will ultimately recover under these policies 
the partnership has also asserted that the cost of pipeline testing  replacement and repair are subject to an equitable sharing arrangement with the pipeline owner  pursuant to the terms of the pipeline lease agreement 
on september   a lawsuit captioned cf qualia operating  inc v 
markwest pinnacle  lp  district court of midland  texas  th judicial district  case no 
cv  was served on a partnership subsidiary  markwest pinnacle  lp  alleging breach of contract  conversion  fraud and breach of implied duty of good faith with respect to a dispute on volumes of gas purchased by the partnership under a gas purchase agreement 
under the gas purchase agreement  markwest energy partners paid the plaintiff based on volumes of gas measured at the wellhead delivery point 
plaintiff claims that it is entitled to a prorated portion of any system gain  ie  that is to be paid for more gas than it actually sold and delivered to the partnership 
markwest energy partners has filed an answer to the complaint denying plaintiff s allegations and has asserted a counter claim for declaratory judgment on the contract terms as being clear and unambiguous as to payment being limited to those measured at the wellhead  that plaintiff s claims are without merit  and that markwest also may have overpaid plaintiff based on  among other things  the wet versus dry btu measurements 
discovery has just begun  and at this time  the partnership is not able to predict the ultimate outcome of this matter 
as a result  the partnership has not provided for a loss contingency 
the partnership acquired the javelina gas processing  transportation and fractionation business located in corpus christi  texas the javelina business on november  the javelina business was a party with numerous other defendants to three lawsuits brought by plaintiffs who had residences or businesses located near the corpus christi industrial area  an area which included the javelina gas processing plant  and several petroleum  petrochemical and metal processing and refining operations

the hipolito gonzales action is subject to a settlement in principle reached in a mediation held december  the partnership s involvement and engagement in the other cases has been limited to this point  but the actions have been and are being vigorously defended and  based on initial evaluation and consultations  it appears at this time that these actions should not have a material impact on the partnership 
the partnership has a non operating ownership interest in starfish pipeline company llc starfish  which operates  through its subsidiaries  certain gulf coast offshore and onshore facilities 
both hurricanes katrina and rita impacted the starfish operations 
based on our discussions with the operator and other owner of starfish  enbridge offshore gas transmission llc enbridge  the partnership has been informed that initial inspections indicate no major damage to starfish s offshore platform facilities 
however  as a result of hurricane rita  repair and rerouting of at least two sections of offshore pipeline will be required  and are expected to be underway through the beginning of the second quarter of further sonar and other inspections of the underwater pipe to assess sediment support and cover  and any other damage  is ongoing 
additionally  structural damage occurred at the onshore starfish dehydration and compressor facilities 
the hurricane caused significant damage to the electrical systems  control equipment and office buildings at the onshore facilities  requiring significant repair 
repair  refurbishment and replacement efforts will continue through the first quarter of starfish operations have been substantially curtailed since shortly before the hurricanes hit the gulf coast in september  and until such repairs are completed starfish is not able to fully return to normal operations and this will have a continuing material impact on operating income through the first quarter of our evaluation of the starfish venture is subject to a number of factors 
we are still in the process of determining the full extent of the damage incurred by hurricane rita  and we must all continue to evaluate our claims for insurance recovery for property damage and business interruption 
in addition  we are also still in discussions with various operators of interconnecting production and processing facilities to the extent their activities were also affected by hurricane damage in the region 
commodity price sensitivity our earnings and cash flow are dependent on sales volumes and our ability to achieve positive sales margins on the product we sell 
the volumes of our sales and our margin on sales can be adversely affected by the prices of commodities  which are subject to significant fluctuation depending upon numerous factors beyond our control  including the supply of and demand for commodity products 
the supply of and demand for our products can be affected by  among other things  production levels  industry wide inventory levels  the availability of imports  the marketing of products by competitors  and the marketing of competitive fuels 
seasonality for the portion of our business that is affected by commodity prices  sales volumes also are affected by various other factors such as fluctuating and seasonal demands for products  changes in transportation and travel patterns and variations in weather patterns from year to year 
effects of inflation inflation in the united states has been relatively low in recent years and did not have a material impact our results of operations for the years ended december   or although the impact of inflation has been insignificant in recent years  it is still a factor in the united states economy and may increase the cost to acquire or replace property  plant and equipment 
it may also increase the costs of labor and supplies 
to the extent permitted by competition  regulation and our existing agreements  we have and will continue to pass along increased costs to our customers in the form of higher fees 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
estimates are used in accounting for  among other items  valuing identified intangible assets  determining the fair value of derivative instruments  evaluating impairments of long lived assets  establishing estimated useful lives for long lived assets  valuing asset retirement obligations  and in determining liabilities  if any  for legal contingencies 
the policies and estimates discussed below are considered by management to be critical to an understanding of the partnership s financial statements  because their application requires the most significant judgments from management in estimating matters for financial reporting that are inherently uncertain 
see note of the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k for additional information on these policies and estimates  as well as a discussion of additional accounting policies and estimates 
intangible assets the partnership s intangible assets are comprised of customer contracts and relationships acquired in business combinations  recorded under the purchase method of accounting at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
using relevant information and assumptions  management determines the fair value of acquired identifiable intangible assets 
fair value is generally calculated as the present value of estimated future cash flows using a risk adjusted discount rate 
the key assumptions include contract renewals  economic incentives to retain customers  historical volumes  current and future capacity of the gathering system  pricing volatility  and the discount rate 
amortization of intangibles with definite lives is calculated using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the intangible asset 
the contracts estimated economic lives are determined by assessing the life of the related assets  likelihood of renewals  competitive factors  regulatory or legal provisions  and maintenance and renewal costs 
impairment of long lived assets the partnership evaluates its long lived assets  including intangibles  for impairment when events or changes in circumstances warrant such a review 
a long lived asset group is considered impaired when the estimated undiscounted cash flows from such asset group are less than the asset group s carrying value 
in that event  a loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long lived asset group 
fair value is determined primarily using estimated discounted cash flows 
management considers the volume of reserves behind the asset and future ngl product and natural gas prices to estimate cash flows 
the amount of additional reserves developed by future drilling activity depends  in part  on expected natural gas prices 
projections of reserves  drilling activity and future commodity prices are inherently subjective and contingent upon a number of variable factors  many of which are difficult to forecast 
any significant variance in any of these assumptions or factors could materially affect future cash flows  which could result in the impairment of an asset 
for assets identified to be disposed of in the future  the carrying value of these assets is compared to the estimated fair value  less the cost to sell  to determine if impairment is required 
until the assets are disposed of  an estimate of the fair value is re determined when related events or circumstances change 
investment in starfish on march   the partnership acquired its non controlling  interest in starfish pipeline company  llc starfish  accounted for under the equity method 
differences between the partnership s investment and its proportionate share of starfish s reported equity are amortized based upon the respective useful lives of the assets to which the differences relate 
we believe the equity method is an appropriate means for us to recognize increases or decreases measured by gaap in the economic resources underlying the investments 
regular evaluation of these investments is appropriate to evaluate any potential need for impairment 
we use the following types of triggers to identify a loss in value of an investment that is other than a temporary decline 
examples of a loss in value may be identified by our belief in the ability to recover the carrying amount of the investment  a current fair value of an investment that is less than its carrying amount  and other operational criteria that cause us to believe the investment may be worth less than otherwise accounted for by using the equity method 
derivative instruments sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  established accounting and reporting standards requiring that derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded at fair value and included in the consolidated balance sheet as assets or liabilities 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation  which is established at the inception 
to the extent derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges are effective  changes in fair value are recognized in other comprehensive income until the underlying hedged item is recognized in earnings 
effectiveness is evaluated by the derivative instrument s ability to offset changes in fair value or cash flows of the underlying hedged item 
any change in the fair value resulting from ineffectiveness is recognized immediately in earnings 
changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges  as well as the changes in the fair value of the underlying hedged item  are recognized currently in earnings 
any differences between the changes in the fair values of the hedged item and the derivative instrument represent gains or losses from ineffectiveness 
to the extent the partnership elects hedge accounting treatment for specific derivatives  the partnership formally documents  designates and assesses the effectiveness of transactions receiving hedge accounting treatment 
as of december   no transactions had been designated for hedge accounting treatment 
in general  the partnership exempts those contracts that qualify as normal purchase and sale contracts from the mark to market requirements of fas no 
and marks all other derivatives to market 
settlements of ngl and natural gas derivative transactions are generally reflected in revenue 
revenue recognition the partnership generates the majority of its revenues from natural gas gathering and processing  ngl fractionation  transportation and storage  and crude oil gathering and transportation 
while all of these services constitute midstream energy operations  the partnership provides its services pursuant to six different types of arrangements 
in many cases  the partnership provides services under contracts that contain a combination of more than one of the arrangements 
the following is a description of the partnership s six arrangements 
fee based arrangements under fee based arrangements  the partnership receives a fee or fees for one or more of the following services gathering  processing  and transmission of natural gas  transportation  fractionation and storage of ngls  and gathering and transportation of crude oil 
the revenue the partnership earns from these contracts is directly related to the volume of natural gas  ngls or crude oil that flows through its systems and facilities and is not directly dependent on commodity prices 
percent of proceeds arrangements under percent of proceeds arrangements  the partnership generally gathers and processes natural gas on behalf of producers  sells the resulting residue natural gas and ngls at market prices and remits to the producers an agreed upon percentage of the proceeds based on an index price 
in other cases  instead of remitting cash payments to the producer  markwest energy delivers an agreed upon percentage of the residue gas and ngls to the producer and sells the volumes it keeps to third parties at market prices 
percent of index arrangements under percent of index arrangements  the partnership generally purchases natural gas at either a percentage discount to a specified index price  a specified index price less a fixed amount or a percentage discount to a specified index price less an additional fixed amount 
markwest energy then gathers and delivers the natural gas to pipelines where it resells the natural gas at the index price 
keep whole arrangements 
under keep whole arrangements  we gather natural gas from the producer  process the natural gas to extract ngls  sell the ngls to third parties and pay the producer  in the form of processed gas or its cash equivalent  for the full thermal equivalent volume of raw natural gas we received from the producer 
accordingly  our net operating margin is a function of the difference between the value of the extracted ngls that we sell and the cost of the processed gas that would replace the thermal equivalent value of those ngls 
the profitability of these arrangements is subject not only to the commodity price risk of natural gas and ngls but also to the price of natural gas relative to the price of ngls 
our net operating margins increase under these arrangements when the value of ngls is high relative to the cost of a thermal equivalent amount of natural gas  and our net operating margins decrease when the cost of natural gas is high relative to the value of a thermal equivalent amount of ngls 
settlement margin under settlement margin  the partnership is allowed to retain a fixed percentage of the natural gas volume gathered to cover the compression fuel charges and deemed line losses 
to the extent the partnership s gathering systems are operated more efficiently than specified per contract allowance  we are entitled to retain the difference for its own account 
condensate sales during the gathering process  thermodynamic forces contribute to changes in operating conditions of the natural gas flowing through the pipeline infrastructure 
as a result  hydrocarbon dew points are reached  causing condensation of hydrocarbons in the high pressure pipelines 
under these arrangements  condensate collected in the system is retained by us and sold at market prices 
under all six arrangements  revenue is recognized at the time the product is delivered and title is transferred 
it is upon delivery and title transfer that the partnership meets all four revenue recognition criteria  and it is at such time that the partnership recognizes revenue 
the partnership s assessment of each of the four revenue recognition criteria as they relate to its revenue producing activities is as follows persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 
the partnership s customary practice is to enter into a written contract  executed by both the customer and the partnership 
delivery 
delivery is deemed to have occurred at the time the product is delivered and title is transferred or  in the case of fee based arrangements  when the services are rendered 
to the extent we retain our equity liquids as inventory  delivery occurs when the inventory is subsequently sold and title is transferred to the third party purchaser 
the fee is fixed or determinable 
the partnership negotiates the fee for its services at the outset of its fee based arrangements 
in these arrangements  the fees are nonrefundable 
the fees are generally due within ten days of delivery or services rendered 
for other arrangements  the amount of revenue is determinable when the sale of the applicable product has been completed upon delivery and transfer of title 
proceeds from the sale of products are generally due in days 
collectibility is probable 
collectibility is evaluated on a customer by customer basis 
new and existing customers are subject to a credit review process  which evaluates the customers financial position eg cash position and credit rating and their ability to pay 
if collectibility is not considered probable at the outset of an arrangement in accordance with the partnership s credit review process  revenue is recognized when the fee is collected 
certain revenue from sales of customer gas to a third party processor is recognized net  under eitf  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  as the partnership earns a fixed amount and does not take ownership of the gas 
earnings per unit except as discussed in the following paragraph  basic and diluted net income per limited partner unit is calculated by dividing net income  after deducting amounts specially allocated to the general partner s interests  including interests in incentive distribution rights  by the weighted average number of limited partner common and subordinated units outstanding during the period 
emerging issues task force issue no 
eitf participating securities and the two class method under fasb statement no 
addresses the computation of earnings per share by entities that have issued securities other than common stock that contractually entitle the holder to participate in dividends and earnings of the entity 
eitf provides that the general partner s interest in net income is to be calculated based on the amount that would be allocated to the general partner if all the net income for the period were distributed  and not on the basis of actual cash distributions for the period 
the application of eitf may have an impact on earnings per limited partner unit in future periods if there are material differences between net income and actual cash distributions or if other participating securities are issued 
the following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per limited partner unit 
the net income available to limited partners and the weighted average limited partner units outstanding have been adjusted for instruments considered common unit equivalents in  and numerator for basic and diluted earnings per limited partner unit net income adjustments general partner s incentive distribution paid participation plan depreciation special allocations see note subtotal general partner s interest net income to limited partners denominator denominator for basic earnings per limited partner unit weighted average number of limited partner units effect of dilutive securities weighted average of restricted units outstanding denominator for diluted earnings per limited partner unit weighted average number of limited partner units basic net income per limited partner unit diluted net income per limited partner unit incentive compensation plans the partnership has elected to continue to measure compensation costs for unit based employee compensation plans as prescribed by accounting principles board apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  as permitted under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
the partnership issues restricted units under the markwest energy partners  lp long term incentive plan 
a restricted unit is a phantom unit that entitles the grantee to receive a common unit upon the vesting of the phantom unit or  at the discretion of the compensation committee  cash equivalent to the value of a common unit 
in accordance with apb  the partnership applies variable accounting for the plan because a phantom unit is an award to employees entitling them to increases in the market value of the partnership s units subsequent to the date of grant without issuing units to the employees  similar to a stock appreciation right 
as a result  the partnership is required to mark to market the awards at the end of each reporting period 
compensation expense is measured for the phantom unit grants using the market price of markwest energy partners common units on the date the units are granted 
the fair value of the units awarded is amortized into earnings over the period of service  adjusted quarterly for the change in the fair value of the unvested units granted 
the phantom units vest over a stated period 
vesting is accelerated for certain employees  if specified performance measures are met 
the accelerated vesting criteria provisions are based on annualized distribution goals 
if the partnership s distributions are at or above the goal for a certain number of consecutive quarters  vesting of the employee s phantom units is accelerated 
the vesting of any phantom units  however  may not occur until at least one year following the date of grant 
the general partner of the partnership may also elect to accelerate the vesting of outstanding awards  which results in an immediate charge to operations for the unamortized portion of the award 
markwest hydrocarbon also has entered into arrangements with certain of its employees and directors referred to as the participation plan 
under the participation plan  markwest hydrocarbon sells subordinated partnership units of the partnership and interests in the partnership s general partner to employees and directors of markwest hydrocarbon under a purchase and sale agreement 
in accordance with the provisions of apb  the participation plan is accounted for as a variable plan 
since the employees and directors are vested except for two non executives who have restricted general partnership interests on the date they purchase the subordinated units or general partner interests  compensation expense for the subordinated units is measured as the difference in the market value of the subordinated partnership units and the amount paid by those individuals 
compensation related to the general partner interest is calculated as the difference in the formula value and the amount paid by those individuals 
the formula value is the amount markwest hydrocarbon would have to pay the directors and employees to repurchase the general partner interests and is based on the current market value of the partnership s common units and the current quarterly distribution paid 
increases or decreases in the market value of the subordinated units and the formula value of the general partner interests between the date they are acquired and the end of each reporting period result in a change in the measure of compensation  which is reflected currently in operations 
under topic b of the codification of the staff accounting bulletins  allocation of expenses and related disclosure in financial statements of subsidiaries  divisions or lesser business components of another entity  compensation expense related to services provided by markwest hydrocarbon s employees and directors recognized under the participation plan should be allocated to the partnership 
the allocation is based on the percent of time that each employee devotes to the partnership 
compensation attributable to interests that were sold to individuals who serve on both the partnership s board of directors and on the board of directors of markwest hydrocarbon is allocated equally 
these charges are included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
assuming the compensation cost for the long term incentive plan and the participation plan had been determined based on the fair value methodology of sfas no 
 the net income and earnings per share would have been the same as reported on the financial statements for the year ended december    and  respectively 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment 
this statement addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for a equity instruments of the enterprise  or b liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
sfas no 
r requires an entity to recognize the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation issued to employees in the income statement 
the revised statement requires that an entity account for those transactions using the fair value based method  and eliminates the intrinsic value method of accounting in apb  accounting for stock issued to employees  which was permitted under sfas no 
 as originally issued 
the revised statement requires entities to disclose information about the nature of the share based payment transactions and the effects of those transactions on the financial statements 
sfas r is effective for public companies for the first fiscal year beginning after december  all public companies must use either the modified prospective or the modified retrospective transition method

the standard also requires presentation within the financial statements that identifies those hybrid financial instruments for which the fair value election has been applied and information on the income statement impact of the changes in fair value of those instruments 
the partnership is required to apply sfas to all financial instruments acquired  issued or subject to a remeasurement event beginning january   although early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an entity s fiscal year 
the provisions of sfas are not expected to have an impact recorded at adoption 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk includes the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
we face market risk from commodity price changes and  to a lesser extent  interest rate changes 
commodity price risk our primary risk management objective is to manage volatility in our cash flows 
a committee  which includes members of senior management of our general partner  oversees all of our derivative activity 
we may utilize a combination of fixed price forward contracts  fixed for floating price swaps and options on the over the counter otc market 
the partnership may also enter into futures contracts traded on the new york mercantile exchange nymex 
swaps and futures contracts allow us to manage volatility in our margins because corresponding losses or gains on the financial instruments are generally offset by gains or losses in our physical positions 
we enter into otc swaps with financial institutions and other energy company counterparties 
we conduct a standard credit review on counterparties and have agreements containing collateral requirements where deemed necessary 
we use standardized swap agreements that allow for offset of positive and negative exposures 
we may be subject to margin deposit requirements under otc agreements with non bank counterparties and nymex positions 
the use of derivative instruments may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances  including instances when i ngls do not trade at historical levels relative to crude oil  ii sales volumes are less than expected requiring market purchases to meet commitments  or iii our otc counterparties fail to purchase or deliver the contracted quantities of natural gas  ngls or crude oil or otherwise fail to perform 
to the extent that we enter into derivative instruments  we may be prevented from realizing the benefits of favorable price changes in the physical market 
we are similarly insulated  however  against unfavorable changes in such prices 
as part of an ongoing comprehensive risk management plan  designed to manage risk and stabilize future cash flows  the partnership has entered into the following derivative instruments that settle monthly through december  costless collars period floor cap fair value at december  crude oil bbl d crude oil bbl d crude oil bbl d propane  gal d propane  gal d propane  gal d jan june ethane  gal d natural gas  mmbtu d jan mar natural gas  mmbtu d april oct natural gas  mmbtu d nov mar natural gas mmbtu d jan mar natural gas mmbtu d april june swaps fixed price fair value at december  crude oil bbl d crude oil bbl d crude oil bbl d fair value is based on available market information for the particular derivative instrument  and incorporates the commodity  period  volume and pricing 
positive negative amounts represent unrealized gains losses 
while we expect these derivative instruments to provide economic stability against the impact of changing commodity prices on our physical positions  for accounting purposes  we will not designate these derivatives as cash flow hedges and will not apply hedge accounting 
as a result of our decision not to designate these derivatives as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes  we are required to mark each contract to market with the resulting unrealized gain or loss recorded in revenue in the income statement 
for the year ended december   unrealized losses of approximately  were recorded 
the fair value of our derivative contracts at december  of  was recorded as a derivative liability 
changes in forward price curves can result in significant changes in the fair value of our derivative contracts as reported  however  we expect the actual settlements to be largely offset by changes in the settlement of our physical positions 
interest rate our primary interest rate risk exposure results from our million long term debt agreement  entered into on december  the debt related to this agreement bears interest at variable rates that are tied to either the us prime rate or libor at the time of borrowing 
we may make use of interest rate swap agreements in the future  to adjust the ratio of fixed and floating rates in our debt portfolio 
long term debt due outstanding at december  variable rate million december  million fixed rate million november  million based on our overall interest rate exposure at december   a hypothetical instantaneous increase or decrease of one percentage point in interest rates applied to borrowings under our credit facility would change earnings by approximately million over a month period
