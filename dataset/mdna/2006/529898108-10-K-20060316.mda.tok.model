in addition  it is the basis on which we internally assess performance  and certain non gaap measures are relevant to our determination of compliance with financial covenants included in our debt agreements

table of contents critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the areas described below are affected by critical accounting estimates and are impacted significantly by judgments and assumptions in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these critical accounting estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts our accounts receivable balance  net of allowances for doubtful accounts  was million in  compared to million in the allowance for doubtful accounts was million in  compared to million in the allowance for doubtful accounts is established through charges to the provision for bad debts 
we regularly evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical trends in collections and write offs  our judgment as to the probability of collecting accounts and our evaluation of business risk 
this evaluation is inherently subjective  as it requires estimates that are susceptible to revision as more information becomes available 
accounts are determined to be uncollectible when the debt is deemed to be worthless or only recoverable in part and are written off at that time through a charge against the allowance 
allowance for slow moving and obsolete inventory we identify slow moving or obsolete inventories and estimate appropriate allowance provisions accordingly 
we provide inventory allowances based upon excess and obsolete inventories driven primarily by future demand forecasts 
historically  these loss provisions have not been significant  as the majority of our inventories are valued using the last in  first out lifo method 
at december   our inventories were million  with loss provisions of million  compared to inventories of million and loss provisions of million at december  the allowance increase in compared to is mainly attributable to syracuse china write downs to lower of cost or market of million and an increase in our allowance that we established for our inventory reduction plans 
asset impairment investments we review our investment in vitrocrisa if indicators of impairment arise 
to the extent that the analysis is performed  the analysis is based upon the discounted cash flow method to determine the fair value of our investment 
the fair value is then compared to the carrying amount of our investment 
to the extent the fair value exceeds the carrying value  no impairment exists 
for all periods presented  no impairment existed 
fixed assets we review fixed assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
determining whether impairment has occurred typically requires various estimates and assumptions 
in  we wrote down the value of certain assets to fair value at our syracuse china facility based upon appraisals performed by an independent third party 
in  due to the closure of our facility in city of industry  california  we wrote down the values of certain assets based upon appraisals performed by an independent third party 
these write downs are further disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets goodwill impairment tests are completed for each reporting unit on an annual basis  or more frequently in certain circumstances where impairment indicators arise 
when performing our test for impairment  we use the discounted cash flow method which incorporates the weighted average cost of capital of a hypothetical third party buyer 
to compute the fair value of each reporting unit 
the fair value is then compared to the carrying value 
to the extent that fair value exceeds the carrying value  no impairment exists 
this was done as of october st for each year presented 
our review indicated an impairment of goodwill of million at our syracuse china facility during this impairment is further disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
individual indefinite life intangible assets are also evaluated for impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently in certain circumstances where impairment indicators arise 
when performing our test for impairment  we use the discounted cash flow method to compute the fair value  which is then compared to the carrying value of the indefinite life intangible asset 
to the extent that fair value exceeds the carrying value  no impairment exists 
this was done as of october for each year presented 
an impairment loss for intangible assets of million was recorded in for our syracuse china facility 
this impairment is further disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
if the company s projected future cash flows were lower  or if the assumed weighted average cost of capital were higher  the testing performed as of october   may have indicated an impairment of one or more of the company s other reporting units and  as a result  the related goodwill would also have been impaired 
as of october  the excess of fair value of the royal leerdam reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately million 

table of contents revenue recognition revenue is recognized when products are shipped and title and risk of loss has passed to the customer 
revenue is recorded net of returns  discounts and sales incentive programs offered to customers 
we offer our various incentive programs to a broad base of customers and we record accruals for these as sales occur 
these programs typically offer incentives for purchase activities by customers that include growth objectives 
criteria for payment include the achievement by customers of certain purchase targets and the purchase by customers of particular product types 
management regularly reviews the adequacy of the accruals based on current customer purchases  targeted purchases and payout levels 
self insurance reserves we use self insurance mechanisms to provide for potential liabilities related to workers compensation and employee health care benefits that are not covered by third party insurance 
workers compensation accruals are recorded at the estimated ultimate payout amounts received from our third party administrator based on individual case estimates 
in addition  we record estimates of incurred but not reported losses as developed by an independent third party actuary 
the workers compensation accrual increased million in primarily due to state audit adjustments  increased claims activity related to significant employment level reductions from the closure of our city of industry  california plant  increased manufacturing down time  and an increase in our estimate of incurred but not reported losses 
group health accruals include estimates of incurred but not reported estimates received from our third party administrator of the plan 
although we believe that the estimated liabilities for self insurance are adequate  the estimates described above may not be indicative of current and future losses 
in addition  the actuarial calculations used to estimate self insurance liabilities are based on numerous assumptions  some of which are subjective 
we will continue to adjust our estimated liabilities for self insurance  as deemed necessary  in the event that future loss experience differs from historical loss patterns 
pension assumptions the following are the assumptions used to determine the benefit obligations and pretax income effect for our pension plan benefits for  and us plans us plans year ended december  discount rate expected long term rate of return on plan assets rate of compensation increase to to to to we account for our defined benefit pension plans on an expense basis that reflects actuarial funding methods 
two critical assumptions  discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets  are important elements of plan expense and asset liability measurement 
we evaluate these critical assumptions on our annual measurement date of december other assumptions involving demographic factors such as retirement age  mortality and turnover are evaluated periodically and are updated to reflect our experience 
actual results in any given year often will differ from actuarial assumptions because of demographic  economic and other factors 
the discount rate enables us to estimate the present value of expected future cash flows on the measurement date 
the rate used reflects a rate of return on high quality fixed income investments that match the duration of expected benefit payments at our december measurement date 
the discount rate at december is used to measure the year end benefit obligations and the earnings effects for the subsequent year 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
to determine the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  we consider the current and expected asset allocations  as well as historical and expected returns on various categories of plan assets 
we made no change to the expected long term rate of return for our non us plans at december  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets at december is used to measure the earnings effects for the subsequent year 
the assumed long term rate of return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets that recognizes gains and losses in the fair 
table of contents value of plan assets that recognizes gains and losses in the fair value of plan assets compared to expected returns over the next five years 
this produces the expected return on plan assets that is included in pension expense income 
the difference between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred and amortized over five years 
the net deferral of past asset gains losses affects the calculated value of plan assets and  ultimately  future pension expense income 
sensitivity to changes in key assumptions is as follows a change of in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would change total pension expense by approximately million based on year end data 
a change of in the discount rate would change our total pension expense by approximately million 
nonpension postretirement assumptions we use various actuarial assumptions  including the discount rate and the expected trend in health care costs  to estimate the costs and benefit obligations for our retiree health plan 
the discount rate is determined based on high quality fixed income investments that match the duration of expected retiree medical benefits at our december measurement date to establish the discount rate 
the discount rate at december is used to measure the year end benefit obligations and the earnings effects for the subsequent year 
the following are the actuarial assumptions used to determine the benefit obligations and pretax income effect for our nonpension postretirement benefits us plans us plans year ended december  discount rate initial health care trend ultimate health care trend years to reach ultimate trend rate sensitivity to changes in key assumptions is as follows a change in the health care trend rate would not have a material impact upon the nonpension postretirement expense and would change the benefit obligation by approximately million 
a change in the discount rate would change the nonpension postretirement expense by million 
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in both the us and certain foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes 
during the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations as to which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
we establish reserves for tax related uncertainties based on estimates of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes and interest will be due 
these reserves are established when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable  we believe that certain positions are likely to be challenged and may not be sustained on review by tax authorities 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit and the expiration of a statute of limitation

table of contents item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk currency we are exposed to market risks due to changes in currency values  although the majority of our revenues and expenses are denominated in the us dollar 
the currency market risks include devaluations and other major currency fluctuations relative to the us dollar  euro or mexican peso that could reduce the cost competitiveness of our products or those of vitrocrisa compared to foreign competition and the impact of exchange rate changes in the mexican peso relative to the us dollar on the earnings of vitrocrisa expressed under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
interest rates we are exposed to market risk associated with changes in interest rates on our floating debt and have entered into interest rate protection agreements rate agreements with respect to million of debt as a means to manage our exposure to fluctuating interest rates 
the rate agreements effectively convert a portion of our long term borrowings from variable rate debt to fixed rate debt  thus reducing the impact of interest rate changes on future income 
we had million of debt subject to fluctuating interest rates at december  a change of one percentage point in such rates would result in a change in interest expense of approximately million on an annual basis 
if the counterparties to these rate agreements were to fail to perform  we would no longer be protected from interest rate fluctuations by these rate agreements 
however  we do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties 
natural gas we are also exposed to market risks associated with changes in the price of natural gas 
we use commodity futures contracts related to forecasted future natural gas requirements of our domestic manufacturing operations 
the objective of these futures contracts is to limit the fluctuations in prices paid and potential losses in earnings or cash flows from adverse price movements in the underlying natural gas commodity 
we consider our forecasted natural gas requirements of our domestic manufacturing operations in determining the quantity of natural gas to hedge 
we combine the forecasts with historical observations to establish the percentage of forecast eligible to be hedged  typically ranging from to of our anticipated requirements  generally six or more months in the future 
for our natural gas requirements that are not hedged  we are subject to changes in the price of natural gas  which affect our earnings 
pension we are exposed to market risks associated with changes in the various capital markets 
changes in long term interest rates affect the discount rate that is used to measure our pension benefit obligations and related pension expense 
changes in the equity and debt securities markets affect the performance of our pension plan asset performance and related pension expense 
sensitivity to these key market risk factors is as follows a change of in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would change total pension expense by approximately million based on year end data 
a change of in the discount rate would change our total pension expense by approximately million
