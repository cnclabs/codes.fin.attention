executive overview management s strategy is to position virco as the overall value supplier of moveable furniture and equipment 
the markets that virco serves include the education market the company s primary market  which is made up of public and private schools preschool through th grade  junior and community colleges  four year colleges and universities  and trade  technical and vocational schools  convention centers and arenas  the hospitality industry  with respect to their banquet and meeting facilities requirements  government facilities at the federal  state  county and municipal levels  and places of worship 
in addition  the company sells to wholesalers  distributors  retailers and catalog retailers that serve these same markets 
these institutions are frequently characterized by extreme seasonality and or a bid based purchasing function 
the company s business model  which is designed to support this strategy  includes the development of several competencies to enable superior service to the markets in which virco competes 
an important element of virco s business model is the company s emphasis on developing and maintaining key manufacturing  warehousing  distribution  and service capabilities 
the company has developed a comprehensive product offering for the furniture  fixtures  and equipment ff e needs for the k education market  enabling a school to procure all of its ff e requirements from one source 
this product offering consists primarily of items manufactured by virco  complemented with product sourced from other furniture manufacturers 
the product offering is continually enhanced with an ongoing new product development program that incorporates internally developed product as well as product lines developed with accomplished designers 
finally  management continues to hone virco s ability to forecast  finance  manufacture  warehouse  deliver  and install furniture within the relatively narrow delivery window associated with the highly seasonal demand for education sales 
in fiscal year  over of the company s total sales were delivered in june  july  august and september with an even higher portion of educational sales delivered in that period 
virco s substantial warehouse space allows the company to build adequate inventories to service this narrow delivery window for the education market 
the commercial furniture markets are recovering from the worst recorded recession in recent history 
as a group  the members of bifma the business and institutional furniture manufacturer s association recorded a increase in shipments in calendar year  and a increase in this followed decreases of  and in  and  respectively 
the impact of the recession on the school market lagged the commercial market and did not hit with full intensity until during this time virco incurred sales declines of   and in   and respectively 
throughout these years of declining sales  virco took appropriate corrective measures to reduce the company s cost structure to match sales volumes 
during  virco s sales volume increased by approximately  and in sales volume increased by approximately 
although sales results have stabilized  during the last two years the company incurred supply chain disruptions and severe cost increases in certain raw materials 
during  the severe hurricanes in the gulf coast region of the united states impacted the availability of certain raw materials used in the production of steel 
in addition to steel shortages  virco obtains plastic used in the production of certain high volume components from the gulf coast region 
both the cost and availability of plastic was severely affected 
finally  virco incurs significant costs relating to energy 
the most significant of the company s energy costs are for diesel fuel  for both outbound freight and inbound materials  though the company also incurs significant costs for both electricity and natural gas 
in the cost of steel  which is the company s largest raw material  doubled and was nearly three times higher than at the beginning of the company incurred severe supply chain disruptions related to steel in  and incurred unfavorable yield variances as the company substituted more expensive or heavier gauge steel when the standard steel required was unavailable 
the cost of plastic and fuel also increased 
due to the nature of the company s annual contracts with school districts  the company was not able to pass on the increased material costs 
the causes  and effects on virco  of general economic conditions are discussed below under industry overview 
in response to the recession and the resulting decrease in sales of virco s products during   and  the company has used a variety of tactics to reduce spending  including its assemble to ship ats operating model  which permits the company to hold reduced inventory levels  strict disciplines over capital expenditures to reduce the investment in pp e  wage and hiring freezes  and reductions in its workforce 
these cost saving measures allowed the company to finish the last two years with cash flow from operations being slightly positive  despite having incurred operating losses for the years 
the company does not anticipate that demand for furniture in the education markets will change substantially in the coming year 
rather we anticipate a continued strong market in bond funded projects  with project completions being flat compared to in addition  management anticipates relatively flat demand for replacement furniture due to the continued financial pressures placed on school operating budgets 
it is our intent to raise prices substantially  in order to recover the increased raw material costs as well as the freight and service costs for those customers that require full service installation and delivery 
actual volume shipped during will be impacted by the behavior of our competitors in response to the increased material costs and selling prices 
we will maintain our core workforce at current levels for the near future  supplemented with temporary labor as considered necessary in order to produce  warehouse  deliver  and install furniture during the coming summer 
because the company has not closed any manufacturing 
table of contents or distribution facilities  any increase in demand for our product can be met without any required investment in physical infrastructure 
critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion and analysis of virco s financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company s financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires virco management to make estimates and judgments that affect the company s reported assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  management evaluates such estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation of inventory including lifo and obsolescence reserves  self insured retention for products and general liability insurance  self insured retention for workers compensation insurance  provision for warranty  liabilities under defined benefit and other compensation programs  and estimates related to deferred tax assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
this forms the basis of judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include the factors discussed above under item  business  and elsewhere in this report on form k 
virco s critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  as revised by sab no 
sales are recorded when title passes and collectability is reasonably assured under its various shipping terms 
the company reports sales as net of sales returns and allowances 
allowances for doubtful accounts considerable judgment is required when assessing the ultimate realization of receivables  including assessing the probability of collection  current economic trends  historical bad debts and the current creditworthiness of each customer 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts that may result from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
over the past five years  the company s allowance for doubtful accounts has ranged from approximately to of accounts receivable at year end 
the allowance is evaluated using historic experience combined with a detailed review of past due accounts 
the company does not typically obtain collateral to secure credit risk 
the primary reason that virco s allowance for doubtful accounts represents such a small percentage of accounts receivable is that a large portion of the accounts receivable are attributable to low credit risk governmental entities  giving virco s receivables a historically high degree of collectability 
although many states are experiencing budgetary difficulties  it is not anticipated that virco s credit risk will be significantly impacted by these events 
over the next year  no significant change is expected in the company s sales to government entities as a percentage of total revenues 
inventory valuation inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market 
the company uses the lifo last in  first out method of accounting for the material component of inventory 
the company maintains allowances for estimated obsolete inventory to reflect the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value 
valuation allowances are determined through a physical inspection of the product in connection with a physical inventory  a review of slow moving product  and consideration of active marketing programs 
the market for education furniture is traditionally driven by value  not style  and the company has not typically incurred significant obsolescence expense 
if market conditions are less favorable than those anticipated by management  additional allowances may be required 
due to reductions in sales volume in the past years  the manufacturing facilities are operating at reduced levels of capacity 
the company records the cost of excess capacity as a period expense  not as a component of capitalized inventory valuation 
self insured retention for   and  the company was self insured for product liability losses up to  per occurrence  for workers compensation losses up to  per occurrence  and for auto liability up to  per occurrence 
the company obtains annual actuarial valuations for the self insured retentions 
product liability and auto reserves for known and unknown incurred but not reported ibnr losses are recorded at the net present value of the estimated losses using a discount rate 
given the relatively short term over which the ibnr losses are discounted  the sensitivity to the discount rate is not significant 
estimated workers compensation losses are funded during the insurance year and subject to retroactive loss adjustments 
the company s exposure to self insured retentions varies depending upon the market conditions in the insurance industry and the availability of cost effective insurance coverage 
it is anticipated that self insured retentions for will be comparable to the retention levels for warranty reserve the company provides a product warranty on most products 
the standard warranty offered on products sold through january   is five years 
effective february   the standard warranty was increased to years on products sold after february  it generally warranties that customers can return a defective product during the specified warranty period following purchase in exchange for a replacement product or that the company can repair the product at no charge to the customer 
the company determines whether replacement or repair is appropriate in each circumstance 
the company uses historic data to estimate appropriate levels of warranty reserves 
because product mix  production methods  and raw material sources change over 
table of contents time  historic data may not always provide precise estimates for future warranty expense 
warranty expense for the last three years has been higher than normal due to a recurring cosmetic complaint relating to a high volume component 
in  the company made appropriate engineering modifications to correct this condition  but may still incur warranty related costs for components produced and sold in prior years 
defined benefit obligations the company has three defined benefit plans  the virco employees retirement plan  the virco important performers vip plan and the non employee directors retirement plan  which provide retirement benefits to employees and outside directors 
virco discounts the pension obligations under the plans using a discount rate  before a assumed rate of increases in compensation rates  and estimating a return on plan assets 
these rate assumptions can vary due to changes in interest rates  the employment market  and expected returns in the stock market 
in prior years  the discount rate and the anticipated rate of return on plan assets have decreased by several percentage points  causing pension expense and pension obligations to increase 
although the company does not anticipate any change in these rates in the coming year  any moderate change should not have a significant effect on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
effective december   the company froze new benefit accruals under all three plans 
the effect of freezing future benefit accruals minimizes the impact of future raises in compensation  but introduces a new assumption related to the plan freeze 
it is the company s intent to resume some form of a retirement benefit when the profitability and the financial condition of the company allow  and the actuarial valuations assume the plans will be frozen for three years 
if the assumption is modified to a permanent freeze  the company would be required to immediately recognize any prior service cost benefit 
if the company had assumed a permanent freeze  pension expense for and would have increased decreased by approximately  and  respectively 
the company obtains annual actuarial valuations for all three plans 
deferred tax assets and liabilities the company recognizes deferred income taxes under the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
deferred income taxes are recognized for differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities at enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  the company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income or reversal of deferred tax liabilities during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
the company considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
based on this consideration  the company anticipates that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will not be realized  and a valuation allowance has been recorded against the net deferred tax assets at january  and january  at january   the company has net operating loss carried forward for federal and state income tax purposes  expiring at various dates through if not utilized 
federal net operating losses that can potentially be carried forward total approximately  at january  state net operating losses that can potentially be carried forward total approximately  at january  industry overview as discussed above  the commercial furniture markets  including virco s core school markets  have suffered from the recent economic recession 
the financial difficulties experienced by our core education customers derive primarily from budgetary pressures and shortfalls at state and local government levels 
in  the state of california received significant press coverage regarding its billion budget shortfall  but funding issues existed at virtually every state and local level 
in and funding levels were more stable  but budgetary pressures to control spending were still prevalent 
the last time states faced such difficult fiscal conditions was after the recession  but the states have reacted differently during the last four years 
in  the states raised taxes by approximately of the previous year s tax collections 
in  states raised taxes by only of the previous year s revenues 
reluctance to raise taxes aggressively may extend the current budget condition 
because many states used debt to bridge budget gaps instead of balancing budgets with tax increases or spending reductions  and because state and local governments are facing continued financial pressure to fund medical and retirement benefits  the outlook for suggests that the market for school furniture will improve  but not substantially in the short term 
funding for school furniture comes from two primary sources 
the first source is from bonds issued to fund new school construction  make major renovations of older schools  and fully equip new and renovated schools 
funding from bond financing has been relatively stable during the past year 
the second source is the general operating fund  which is a primary source of replacement furniture 
the decline in virco s sales in recent years is primarily attributable to sharp reductions in replacement furniture purchased from the general fund 
approximately of a school s budget is spent on salaries and benefits for teachers and administrators 
in times of budget shortfalls  schools traditionally attempt to retain teachers and spend less on repairs  maintenance  and replacement furniture 

table of contents while the short term economic conditions impacting our core customer base are not overwhelmingly positive  there are certain underlying demographics  customer responses  and changes in the competitive landscape that provide opportunities 
first  the underlying demographics of the student population are very stable compared to the volatility of furniture purchases 
the student population grows slowly 
the volatility is attributable to the financial health of the school systems 
virco management believes that there is a pent up demand for quality school furniture 
second  management believes that parents and voters will demand that we educate our children and make this an ongoing priority for future government spending 
third  many schools have responded to the budget strains by reducing their support infrastructure 
school districts historically have operated central warehouses and professional purchasing departments in a central business office 
in order to retain teaching staff  many school districts have shut down the warehouses and reduced their purchasing departments 
this change provides opportunities to sell services to schools  such as project management for new or renovated schools  delivery to individual school sites rather than truckload deliveries to central warehouses  installation of furniture in classrooms  and opportunity to provide a complete product assortment allowing one stop shopping as opposed to sourcing furniture needs from a variety of suppliers 
fourth  many suppliers have shut down or dramatically curtailed their domestic manufacturing capabilities  making it difficult for competitors to provide custom colors or finishes during a tight seasonal summer delivery window when they are reliant upon a supply chain extending to china 
finally  the financial health of the competition  both manufacturers and dealers  has been adversely impacted by the continued downturn in the school furniture business  creating opportunities for suppliers that can provide dependable delivery of quality product and services 
a final opportunity  which can impact short term industry demand  is the rebuilding of school systems that have been destroyed by hurricanes and flooding 
school furniture is one of the last items acquired when building a new school  and there is a time lag between funding a new school and the eventual shipment of school furniture 
this rebuilding is traditionally funded by fema or other disaster relief  not through traditional school funding mechanisms 
virco response to the industry environment in response to robust industry growth during the mid to late s  virco built and equipped a large new furniture manufacturing and distribution facility in conway  arkansas  that initiated operations in and in addition to that significant capital expansion of physical capacity  the company implemented an sap erp system in in response to yk concerns coupled with limitations to its legacy computer system 
the timing of these large capital investments was unfortunate  as the industry recession discussed above initiated approximately one year after this new capacity came on line 
in response to the volatile changes in what has traditionally been a relatively stable market  virco has pursued a variety of programs to improve its competitive position in the market  to reduce its cost structure to be appropriate for reduced sales volume  and to position the company for growth in volume and market share as the industry recovers 
in response to the sharp decline in sales  many furniture manufacturers responded by shutting down significant portions of their manufacturing capacity and laying off thousands of workers  incurring large restructuring charges in the process 
because the education market was not impacted as rapidly as the commercial markets  in the first two years of this recession  virco responded with a different approach designed to preserve the company s manufacturing and distribution infrastructure and save the jobs of virco s trained workforce 
the company used a variety of tactics to reduce spending 
capital expenditures were reduced to approximately one quarter of depreciation expense in and  and one third of depreciation expense in the company embraced the ats operating model  which facilitated reductions in inventory levels and improved levels of customer service 
to control and reduce the cost of virco s workforce  the company used traditional measures such as wage freezes and hiring freezes  as well as more creative measures that addressed the unique demands of a highly seasonal business  including programs to encourage workforce flexibility 
the tactics used by virco to weather the reductions in sales during and were not adequate to address the reduction in sales in in addition to the cost saving efforts used in the prior two years  virco implemented a voluntary separation program  which was accepted by employees of the workforce in the second quarter 
in the third quarter  the company laid off an additional employees 
in  there were no reductions in force  but the company held capital expenditures to approximately one quarter of depreciation expense  and the company used temporary labor to supplement the permanent workforce during busy times of the year 
during  the company continued to use temporary labor to supplement the permanent labor force during busy times of the year  held capital expenditures to less than one half of depreciation expense  and in the third quarter completed what management is confident will be the final reduction in force by laying off approximately employees 
the cumulative result of these five years of cost reductions has been significant 
virco s headcount of permanent employees has declined from a peak of nearly  in august to a total of approximately  permanent employees at january  factory overhead  which peaked at over million in fiscal year ended january  was approximately million in fiscal year ended january  for the fiscal year ended january   factory overhead as a percentage of sales is less than it was prior to the significant capital expenditures in   and  despite the reduction in sales volume 
virco has accomplished this with out closing factories and without closing any of the primary distribution facilities 
selling  general  and administrative expenses  which do not fluctuate significantly 
table of contents with volume have declined by approximately million from their peak and currently represent the same percentage of sales as in  despite our reduced sales volume 
in addition to significant cost reductions  the company has made several investments in both product and process to strengthen its competitive position 
during the last five years  virco has completed three modest acquisitions  all within the constrained capital expenditure budgets discussed above 
the first acquisition was furniture focus tm  a reseller of ff e that was a former virco customer 
the acquisition of furniture focus included their proprietary planscape software  used to bid and manage projects to furnish all items in the ff e budget category of a new school project 
over the past four years  furniture focus has been integrated into virco  and at the february sales meeting  a new release of the planscape software was rolled out to the entire virco sales force 
virco has embraced the relationships furniture focus had developed with other furniture manufacturers that provide ff e not manufactured by virco 
virco has incorporated these items into our product offering  enabling virco to provide one stop shopping for ff e needs 
in addition to furniture focus  virco has acquired assets from two furniture component manufacturers 
while the production of many furniture components has moved to low cost locations such as china  many components are too bulky to import on a cost effective basis 
in  virco purchased assets and intellectual property of corex products  inc  a component manufacturer of compression molded parts 
the acquired equipment was integrated into our existing compression molding facility in conway  arkansas 
in  virco purchased substantial injection molding capacity from a former supplier  allowing virco to bring the production of certain high volume components in house 
these machines are currently being moved into our conway  arkansas facility  and a portion of these machines are in operation 
finally  during the past five years of cost reductions  virco has continued to invest in new products  including our successful zuma and zumafrd lines of education furniture 
initiatives to improve product and service quality have been successful  and the company has improved its track record for dependable on time delivery of product during the tight summer delivery window 
the company s lack of financial performance during the last two years have been attributable to the consequences of annual fixed price contracts  coupled with extraordinary volatility in our most significant commodity and energy costs 
during the past five years  it has been difficult to raise prices in the midst of the most significant sales downturn we have ever experienced 
in  the company did not charge high enough prices to cover the variable cost of services  especially related to small orders delivered to customer locations 
this was exacerbated with the extreme increase in steel and other commodity costs 
for  the company raised prices  but not enough 
continued commodity cost increases  fueled by petroleum related costs for plastics and fuel  accompanied by supply chain disruptions related to gulf coast hurricanes  adversely impacted operating margins 
for  the company has significantly raised prices  and introduced tiered pricing under its most significant contracts to cover the costs of servicing small orders 
while substantial price increases always risk a related loss of sales volume  the cost pressures experienced by virco have impacted the entire industry  and the company believes that competitors will also raise prices to recover their increased costs 
management believes that the company s dependable delivery  enhanced product offering  and new product offerings will enable virco to execute this substantial price increase without a significant impact on volume 
results of operations vs 
financial results and cash flow for the year ended january   the company had a net loss of  on net sales of  compared to a net loss of  on net sales of  in the same period last year 
the loss was per share for the year ended january   compared to a net loss of per share in the prior year 
cash flow from operations was  compared to  in the prior year 
during  the company incurred a large operating loss  yet managed to finish the year with cash flow from operations being slightly positive 
to accomplish this  the company was able to substantially finance the increase in inventory with vendor credit 
the company limited capital expenditures to  compared to depreciation expense of  sales virco s sales increased by in to  compared to  in as discussed above  the furniture industry stabilized in and after three consecutive years of decline 
the increased sales volume was attributable to increased prices  offset by a slight decline in unit volume 
the company benefited from increased project sales and increased sales through commercial channels 
sales of virco s new zuma product line increased significantly  but were offset by reductions in older product lines 
for the company will significantly raise selling prices to cover the cumulative impact of the increased cost of raw materials and freight expenses that have adversely impacted the last two years financial results 
the company continues to emphasize the value of 
table of contents virco s products  the value of virco s distribution and delivery capabilities  and the value of timely deliveries during the peak seasonal delivery period 
although this policy may have an adverse effect on unit volume  the company intends to restore its gross margins to levels that will restore profitable operations 
cost of sales cost of sales was of sales in and of sales for the cost of sales in total was slightly improved  but the components of the cost varied in compared to at the beginning of  the company raised prices with the intent of covering the increased cost of raw materials experienced in the company was successful in raising prices  but did not raise them enough to recover the cumulative impact of increased material costs compounded with the increases incurred in as a percentage of sales  material cost increased in  but was offset by reduced direct labor and overhead costs  resulting in a net improvement in gross margin 
in  the company intends to maintain the improved overhead cost structure attained through the restructurings in and  and recover the increased material costs incurred in and by increased selling prices 
the company intends to more tightly integrate the ats model with our marketing programs  product development programs  and product stocking plan 
this anticipated improvement in execution of ats should allow the company to offer a wide variety of product while improving on time delivery performance 
although the company is beginning the year with slightly more inventory  production levels  which will vary depending upon selling volumes  are anticipated to be comparable to the company anticipates continued uncertainty and upward pressure on costs  particularly in the areas of certain raw materials  transportation  energy  and employee benefits in the coming year 
steel and plastic have stabilized during the first quarter of  but remain at high prices 
for more information  please see the section below entitled inflation and future change in prices 
selling  general and administrative and others selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended january   excluding severance costs  increased by approximately million  but were as a percentage of sales as compared to in freight costs were flat and decreased slightly as a percentage of sales 
freight costs were adversely impacted by increased fuel rates  offset by a reduction in the numbers of smaller orders delivered to customers 
installation costs increased as a result of increased project orders  and selling expenses increased as a result of variable sales costs and rebates paid to customers 
for  the company intends to raise selling prices to cover increased raw material costs as well as increase prices on smaller orders and orders requiring full service 
if successful  this should cause freight and installation costs to decline as a percentage of sales in  but there can be no assurance of attaining a reduction due to volatility in fuel and freight rates as well as fluctuations in the portion of business requiring full service 
interest expense was nearly  more than the prior year 
borrowing levels were slightly higher than the prior year  and interest rates were higher 
in  the company anticipates slightly higher average borrowing levels and an increase in the average interest rate paid 
provision for income taxes the company recognizes deferred income taxes under the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
deferred income taxes are recognized for differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities at enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse

the company limited capital expenditures to  compared to depreciation expense of  by year end  the company was able to reduce its long term debt by more than million 
sales virco s sales increased by in to  compared to  in as discussed above  the furniture industry recovered modestly in after three consecutive years of decline 
the increase in sales was primarily attributable to increased projects 
in addition  the commercial furniture markets enjoyed a modest recovery as well 
although the market for school furniture improved in  states and local governments were still suffering budgetary pressures  and the market still remained weak 
due to the significant reduction in the school furniture sales in  competition was pronounced and virco was unable to increase prices during when the company incurred large increases in raw material costs  it was unable to pass along these costs under the annual contracts with school districts 
the increase in sales was attributable to volume increases as opposed to price 
cost of sales cost of sales was of sales for both and the cost of sales in total was stable  but the components of the cost varied dramatically in compared to during  the cost of raw materials increased dramatically  offset by a comparable reduction in manufacturing overhead spending in compared to during the beginning of  virco had incurred significant disruption in the supply of steel in addition to markedly higher prices 
very significant purchases of steel by china  of both finished product and raw materials to produce steel  impacted the market for steel 
in addition  a fire in one of the largest coal mines in the united states disrupted the supply of domestic steel 
during the cost of steel nearly doubled 
in addition to higher steel prices  the company incurred increases in the prices of raw materials and operating expenses that were impacted by the cost of oil  especially plastics and freight expense 
the increase in raw material costs was offset by a reduction in overhead spending 
during  in response to a decline in sales volume  production volume was reduced to match the decline in sales volume  and further reduced to facilitate a million reduction in inventory 
the decreases in production volume  combined with certain inefficiencies associated with the reduction in workforce  caused overhead variances to increase 
selling  general and administrative and others selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended january   excluding severance costs  decreased by more than million despite a increase in sales  and were as a percentage of sales as compared to in freight costs increased by approximately  and decreased slightly as a percentage of sales 
freight and installation costs in were adversely impacted by increased fuel costs and an increase in small orders requiring freight and installation 
during the summer of the company reduced its workforce by employees 
while the reduction in the workforce successfully lowered the company s cost structure  the company incurred certain inefficiencies in coordinating production  shipment  and installation of customer orders during the third quarter of the company did not incur comparable inefficiencies in for  the company initiated programs to streamline product offerings  tightly integrated the inventory stocking program to coordinate with marketing programs  and reorganized freight and installation teams to improve the efficiency of freight and installation costs 
during  the company initiated a voluntary separation program in the second quarter followed by a non voluntary reduction in workforce in the third quarter 
in connection with these reductions  the company incurred  of severance costs 
during  the company incurred no restructuring costs  and was able to support an increased volume in sales by supplementing the existing workforce with part time or temporary labor 

table of contents interest expense was approximately  more than the prior year 
both borrowing levels and interest rates were comparable to the prior year 
in virco had no gain or loss on the disposition of assets  compared to when virco realized a significant gain on the sale of a former manufacturing facility 
this facility had been held as rental property since when the company relocated to the torrance  california  manufacturing and distribution operation 
the gain on sale for was  liquidity and capital resources working capital requirements virco addresses liquidity and capital requirements in the context of short term seasonal requirements and the long term capital requirements of the business 
the company s core business of selling furniture to publicly funded educational institutions is extremely seasonal 
the seasonal nature of this business permeates most of virco s operational  capital  and financing decisions 
the company s working capital requirements during and in anticipation of the peak summer season oblige management to make estimates and judgments that affect virco s assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
management expends a significant amount of time during the year  and especially in the first quarter  developing a stocking plan and estimating the number of employees  the amount of raw materials  and the types of components and products that will be required during the peak season 
if management underestimates any of these requirements  virco s ability to fill customer orders on a timely basis or to provide adequate customer service may be diminished 
if management overestimates any of these requirements  the company may be required to absorb higher storage  labor and related costs  each of which may affect profitability 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates such estimates  including those related to market demand  labor costs  and inventory levels  and continually strives to improve virco s ability to correctly forecast business requirements during the peak season each year 
as part of virco s efforts to address seasonality  financial performance and quality without sacrificing service or market share  management has been refining the company s ats operating model 
ats is virco s version of mass customization  which assembles standard  stocked components into customized configurations before shipment 
the company s ats program reduces the total amount of inventory and working capital needed to support a given level of sales 
it does this by increasing the inventory s versatility  delaying assembly until the last moment  and reducing the amount of warehouse space needed to store finished goods 
in addition  virco finances its largest balance of accounts receivable during the peak season 
this occurs for two primary reasons 
first  accounts receivable balances naturally increase during the peak season as shipments of products increase 
second  many customers during this period are government institutions  which tend to pay accounts receivable more slowly than commercial customers 
as the capital required for the summer season generally exceeds cash available from operations  virco has historically relied on third party bank financing to meet seasonal cash flow requirements 
virco has established a long term relationship with its primary lender  wells fargo bank 
on an annual basis  the company prepares a forecast of seasonal working capital requirements  and renews its revolving line of credit 
for fiscal  virco has entered into a revolving credit facility with wells fargo bank  amended and restated december   which provides a term loan of  and a secured revolving line of credit that varies with levels of inventory and receivables  up to a maximum of  the term loan is a two year line amortizing at  per year with interest payable monthly at a fluctuating rate equal to the bank s prime rate plus 
the revolving line has a month maturity with interest payable monthly at a fluctuating rate equal to the bank s prime rate plus a margin of 
the revolving line typically provides for advances of on eligible accounts receivable and on eligible inventory 
the revolving credit facility with wells fargo bank is subject to various financial covenants and places certain restrictions on capital expenditures  new operating leases  dividends and the repurchase of the company s common stock 
approximately  was available for borrowing as of january  during fiscal years and  the company incurred operating losses  yet managed to have positive cash flow from operations 
during and  the company incurred large operating losses  yet managed to finish each year with less debt than at the beginning of the year 
this was accomplished through the following actions 
in  the company spent million on capital expenditures compared to million of depreciation expense 
increases in inventory were substantially financed by increases in vendor credit 
in  the company spent million on capital expenditures  compared to depreciation expense of million 
in addition  receivables were reduced by over million and inventories were reduced by nearly million 
in fiscal year  the company reduced inventory balances by over million 
this was accomplished by streamlining the product offering for fiscal year  delaying until february virco s seasonal production of stock inventory for summer delivery  and aggressively reducing other inventories 
the company spent million on capital expenditures  compared to depreciation expense of million  providing 
table of contents more than million of cash 
the company sold a former manufacturing facility  formerly held as rental property  which generated nearly  in cash 
finally  the company terminated or curtailed certain benefit programs  including split dollar life insurance and deferred compensation plans  which reduced other non current assets by million 
many of these actions are one time events  and will not be repeated in future years 
the only anticipated recurring event is the excess of depreciation over capital expenditures 
the company is budgeting for capital expenditures to be less than depreciation for fiscal year  and the amount of cash generated is expected to be approximately million 
as a result of the increased material costs previously described  the company violated debt covenants related to the line of credit with wells fargo at the end of the third quarter of the violation of covenants was waived at the end of the quarter  and the company re negotiated its line of credit with the bank effective december  as a result of the increased material costs previously described  the company violated debt covenants related to the line of credit with wells fargo and at the end of the third quarter of the violation of covenants was waived at the end of the quarter  and the company re negotiated its line of credit with the bank effective january  management believes cash generated from operations and from the previously described sources will be adequate to meet its capital requirements in the next months 
long term capital requirements in addition to short term liquidity considerations  the company continually evaluates long term capital requirements 
in  the company initiated two large capital projects  which have had significant effects on cash flow for the past five years 
in the   and fiscal years the company expended significant amounts of capital on these projects 
upon completion of these projects  the company dramatically reduced capital spending 
as shown in the company s consolidated statements of cash flows  during    and capital expenditures ranged from one quarter to one third of depreciation expense 
during capital expenditures were approximately of depreciation 
the first project was the implementation of the sap enterprise resources planning system  initiated in october the company went live with the new system in march  implemented a business to business website along with sales force automation in the first quarter of  and upgraded to a more current version of sap in the fourth quarter of the initial portion of this project was financed with a lease from general electric capital corporation gecc 
capital and training costs not funded by the lease were financed from cash flows from operations and from the loan facility from wells fargo bank 
during fiscal year the company paid off the balance of the capital lease 
the second project was the expansion and re configuration of the conway  arkansas  manufacturing and distribution facility 
during    and the company expended approximately  to purchase acres of land  and build a  sq 
ft 
manufacturing and distribution facility equipped with new manufacturing and warehousing equipment 
to finance this project  the company borrowed  from wells fargo bank  obtained equipment with operating leases from gecc  and used operating cash flow 
as phases of the conway expansion were completed  the company was able to vacate several leased warehouses  sell a small production facility  and convert a second production facility into a warehouse 
in addition  virco sold a warehouse located in torrance  california  which had been held as rental property 
upon the completion of these substantial capital projects  the company significantly reduced capital spending in   and management intends to limit future capital spending until growth in sales volume fully utilizes the new plant and distribution capacity 
the company has established a goal of limiting capital spending to less than  for  which is approximately one half of anticipated depreciation expense 
asset impairment in  virco acquired certain assets of furniture focus  including its proprietary planscape software 
as part of this acquisition  the company recorded goodwill of  during  the company rolled out the furniture focus package business nationwide 
for  virco expended significant effort training the sales force in package selling 
in  virco will release the next generation of the planscape software to its entire sales force 
in addition  virco stocks selected products of other manufacturers that complement virco s product line  enabling virco to fill nearly the entire ff e budget line item for a k school from products carried in stock 
virco evaluates the impairment of goodwill at least annually  or when indicators of impairment occur 
as of january   there has been no impairment to the goodwill recorded 
in december  virco acquired certain assets of corex products  inc  a manufacturer of compression molded components  for approximately million 
the assets have been transferred to the company s conway  arkansas  location where they have been integrated with virco s existing compression molding operation 
in connection with this acquisition  virco acquired certain patents and other intangible assets 
as of january   there has been no impairment to the intangible assets recorded 

table of contents virco made substantial investments in its infrastructure in   and the investments included a new factory  new warehouse  and new production and distribution equipment 
the factory  warehouse  and equipment acquired are used to produce  store  and ship a variety of product lines  and the use of any one piece of equipment is not dependent on the success or volume of any individual product 
new products are designed to use as many common or existing components as practical 
as a result  both our ats inventory components and the machines used to produce them become more versatile 
virco evaluates the potential for impaired assets on a quarterly basis 
as of january   there has been no impairment to the long term assets of the company 
contractual obligations the company leases manufacturing  transportation  and office equipment  as well as real estate under a variety of operating leases 
the company leases substantially all vehicles  including trucks and passenger cars under operating leases where the lessor provides fleet management services for the company 
the fleet management services provide virco with operating efficiencies relating to the acquisition  administration  and operation of leased vehicles 
the use of operating leases for manufacturing equipment has enabled the company to qualify for and use industrial revenue bond financing 
real estate leases have been used where the company did not want to make a long term commitment to a location  or when economic conditions favored leasing 
the torrance manufacturing and distribution facility is leased under an operating lease through the company has one five year option to extend the lease 
the company does not have any lease obligations or purchase commitments in excess of normal recurring obligations 
leasehold improvements and tenant improvement allowances are depreciated over the lesser of the expected life of the asset or the lease term 
contractual obligations payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations interest on long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term obligations virco s largest market is publicly funded school districts 
a significant portion of this business is awarded on a bid basis 
many school districts require that a bid bond be posted as part of the bid package 
in addition to bid bonds  many districts require a performance bond when the bid is awarded 
at january   the company had bonds outstanding valued at approximately  to the best of management s knowledge  in over years of selling to schools  virco has never had a bid or performance bond called 
the company accrues an estimate of its exposure to warranty claims based upon both product sales data and warranty claims incurred 
in  warranty claims returned to more typical level 
at the current time  management cannot reasonably determine whether warranty claims for the upcoming fiscal year will be less than  equal to  or greater than warranty claims incurred in for  warranty claims were higher than normal due to a recurring cosmetic complaint relating to a high volume component 
the following is a summary of the company s warranty claim activity during and january  beginning balance provision costs incurred ending balance retirement obligations 
table of contents the company provides retirement benefits to employees and non employee directors under three defined benefit retirement plans  the virco employee s retirement plan  the virco important performers vip retirement plan  and the retirement plan for non employee directors 
the virco employee retirement plan is a qualified retirement plan that is funded through a trust held at wells fargo bank trustee 
the other two plans are non qualified retirement plans 
the vip plan is secured by life insurance policies held in a rabbi trust and the plan for non employee directors is not funded 
for  and the company used a expected return on plan assets  a expected rate of increase in compensation  and a discount rate 
three significant events occurred during that affected the retirement plans 
first  approximately of virco s employees severed their employment with virco during the year 
the majority of these employees accepted a voluntary severance package 
this severance was treated as plan curtailment 
second  a significant number of employees that severed their employment elected a lump sum benefit 
during the pension trust disbursed approximately million to severed employees 
these distributions were accounted for as a plan settlement 
finally  effective december   virco froze all future benefit accruals under the plans 
employees can continue to vest under the benefits earned to date  but no covered participants will earn additional benefits under the plan freeze 
as a result of these activities  virco incurred additional pension expense of approximately  related to the plan curtailment  additional pension expense of approximately  related to the plan settlement  and additional pension expense of approximately  related to the plan freeze 
as a result of the freeze  the projected benefit obligation decreased by approximately  the plan freeze is not intended to be permanent 
it is management s intention to restore some form of a retirement benefit when the company s profitability and cash flow allow 
during and  the company s results of operations and financial position did not allow for a retirement benefit to be restored 
benefit accruals under the plans have remained frozen 
for and  expenses related to the pensions decreased by more than million compared to it is the company s intent to maintain the funded status of the qualified plan at a minimum of of the current liability as determined by the plan s actuaries 
during  the company contributed approximately  to the qualified plan and paid approximately  under the non qualified plans 
during and the company paid approximately  under the non qualified plans 
it is anticipated that contributions for will be less than million 
the company does not anticipate making any significant changes to the pension assumptions in the near future 
if the company were to have used different assumptions in the fiscal year ended january   a reduction in investment return would have increased expense by approximately  a change in the rate of compensation increase would had no impact  and a reduction in the discount rate would have increased expense by  a reduction in the discount rate would have increased the pbo by approximately million 
if virco elected to make the plan freeze permanent  pension expense would decrease by approximately  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the pension plans and related expenses 
stockholders equity in april  the board of directors approved a stock buy back program giving authorization to buy back up to  of company stock 
the authorization of this stock buy back program was increased to    and  in january  april  december and december  respectively 
the current line of credit with wells fargo bank does not allow for repurchases of stock 
when the results of operations and cash flow allow  the company will re evaluate the stock buyback program 
as of the end of january and  the company had repurchased approximately  and  shares at a cost of approximately  and  respectively 
during  the company retired the shares of treasury stock 
the company did not repurchase any shares of stock during and prior to  virco had established a track record of paying cash dividends to its stockholders for more than consecutive years 
as a result of the recent operating losses  the company discontinued paying dividends in the second quarter of the current line of credit with wells fargo bank does not allow for cash dividends 
when the results of operations  cash flow  and loan covenants allow  the company intends to reinstate the cash dividend policy 
virco issued a stock dividend or stock split every year beginning in through although the stock dividend has no cash consequences to the company  the accounting methodology required for dividends has affected the equity section of the balance sheet 
when the company records a stock dividend  of the market capitalization of the company on the date of the declaration is reclassified from retained earnings to additional paid in capital 
during the period from through  the cumulative effect of the stock dividends has been to reclassify over million from retained earnings to additional paid in capital 
the equity section of the balance sheet on january   reflects additional paid in capital of approximately million and deficit retained earnings of approximately million 
other than the losses incurred in the past three years  the retained deficit is a 
table of contents result of the accounting reclassification  and is not the result of accumulated losses 
environmental and contingent liabilities the company and other furniture manufacturers are subject to federal  state  and local laws and regulations relating to the discharge of materials into the environment and the generation  handling  storage  transportation  and disposal of waste and hazardous materials 
in addition to policies and programs designed to comply with environmental laws and regulations  virco has enacted programs for recycling and resource recovery that have earned repeated commendations  including the california waste reduction awards program  designation in as a charter member of the wastewise hall of fame  in as a wastewise partner of the year  and in as a wastewise program champion for large businesses by the united states environmental protection agency 
despite these significant accomplishments  environmental laws have changed rapidly in recent years  and virco may be subject to more stringent environmental laws in the future 
the company has expended  and expects to continue to expend  significant amounts in the future for the investigation of environmental conditions  installation of environmental control equipment  and remediation of environmental contamination 
in and  the company was self insured for product liability losses up to  per occurrence  for workers compensation losses up to  per occurrence  and for auto liability up to  per occurrence 
in prior years the company has been self insured for workers compensation  automobile  product  and general liability losses 
the company has purchased insurance to cover losses in excess of the self insured retention or deductible up to a limit of  for the insurance year beginning april   the company will be self insured for product liability losses up to  per occurrence  for workers compensation losses up to  per occurrence  and for auto liability up to  per occurrence 
in future years  the company s exposure to self insured retentions will vary depending upon the market conditions in the insurance industry and the availability of cost effective insurance coverage 
during the past years the company has aggressively pursued a program to improve product quality  reduce product liability claims and losses  and to more aggressively litigate product liability cases 
this program has continued through and has resulted in reductions in product liability claims and litigated product liability cases 
in addition  the company has active safety programs to improve plant safety and control workers compensation losses 
management does not anticipate that any related settlement  after consideration of the existing reserves for claims and potential insurance recovery  would have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
off balance sheet arrangements the company did not enter into any material off balance sheet arrangements during its fiscal year  nor did the company have any material off balance sheet arrangements outstanding at january  new accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs 
this statement amends the guidance in accounting research bulletin no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material scrap 
sfas no 
requires that those items be recognized as current period charges 
in addition  sfas no 
requires that the allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for inventory costs incurred in fiscal years beginning after june  as such  the company plans to adopt these provisions for the annual reporting period beginning february  the company does not believe that the adoption of sfas will have a material effect on its results of operations or consolidated financial position 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  or sfas sfas replaces apb no 
 accounting changes and sfas no

the reporting of a correction of an error by restating previously issued financial statements is also addressed 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  the company does not believe that the adoption of sfas will have a material effect on its results of operations or consolidated financial position 
on december   the fasb issued sfas no

in april  the securities and exchange commission sec adopted a new rule which defers the compliance date of sfas no 
r until february   for the company 
consistent with the new rule  the company intends to adopt sfas no 
r in the first quarter of fiscal the company has not yet determined the impact of the adoption of sfas r upon its results of operations or consolidated financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk inflation and future change in prices inflation rates had a significant impact on the results of operations for   and during these years the company incurred substantial increases in the cost of raw materials and energy  particularly steel  plastic  and diesel fuel 
in  president bush announced that he would impose  tariffs of up to on imports of selected steel products pursuant to section of the trade act of during the second half of  the company incurred higher costs related to steel prices 
during  steel prices remained relatively stable  but at the higher levels incurred in the later half of during the beginning of  virco incurred significant disruption in the supply of steel in addition to markedly higher prices 
very significant purchases of steel by china  of both finished product and raw materials to produce steel  have impacted the market for steel 
in addition  a fire in one of the largest coal mines in the united states disrupted the supply of domestic steel 
during the cost of steel nearly doubled 
in addition to higher steel prices  the company incurred increases in the prices of raw materials and operating expenses that are impacted by the cost of oil  especially plastics and freight expense 
during  the company again incurred increased commodity prices and supply disruptions  primarily related to petroleum related fuel and plastics 
steel  which has experienced volatile price increases in recent years remained expensive 
furthermore  one of the company s significant suppliers of steel obtained of a key component of their steel processing from the gulf coast region 
steel deliveries were disrupted as a result of the hurricanes 
the company uses large quantities of plastic to manufacture certain high volume components 
the company s suppliers of plastic are concentrated in the gulf coast region 
for a period of time during and after the storms  price  availability  and rail car delivery of plastic was adversely impacted 
for  the company anticipates continued upward pressure on costs  particularly in the areas of certain raw materials  transportation  energy and employee benefits 
the price and supply of steel have stabilized compared to and  but continue to be expensive 
there is continued uncertainty on raw material costs that are affected by the price of oil  especially plastics 
transportation costs are also expected to be adversely affected by increased oil prices  in the form of increased operation costs for our fleet  and surcharges on freight paid to third party carriers 
virco expects to incur continued pressure on employee benefit costs 
virco has aggressively addressed these costs by reducing headcount  freezing pension benefits  passing on a portion of increased medical costs to employees  and hiring temporary workers who are not eligible for benefit programs 
to recover the cumulative impact of increased costs  the company has raised the list prices for virco s products 
as a significant portion of virco s business is obtained through competitive bids  the company is carefully considering the increased material cost in addition to increased transportation costs as part of the bidding process 
total material costs for  as a percentage of sales  could be higher than in  but it is the company s intention to raise selling prices enough so that material costs  as a percentage of sales  will decline compared to and however  no assurance can be given that the company will experience stable  modest or substantial increases in prices in the company is working to control and reduce costs by improving production and distribution methodologies  investigating new packaging and shipping materials  and searching for new sources of purchased components and raw materials 
the company uses the lifo method of accounting for the material component of inventory 
under this method  the cost of products sold as reported in the financial statements approximates current cost  and reduces the distortion in reported income due to increasing costs 
depreciation expense represents an allocation of historic acquisition costs and is less than if based on the current cost of productive capacity consumed 
in    and  the company significantly reduced its expenditures for capital assets  but in the previous three fiscal years   and the company made the significant fixed asset acquisitions described above 
the assets acquired result in higher depreciation charges  but due to technological advances should result in operating cost savings and improved product quality 
in addition  some depreciation charges were offset by a reduction in lease expense 
the company is also subject to interest rate risk related to its  of borrowings as of january   and any seasonal borrowings used to finance additional inventory and receivables 
rising interest rates may adversely affect the company s results of operations and cash flows related to its variable rate bank borrowings 
accordingly  a basis point upward fluctuation in the lender s base rate would have caused the company to incur additional interest charges of approximately  for the months ended january  the company would have benefited from a similar interest savings if the base rate were to have fluctuated downward by a like amount
