as noted elsewhere in this annual report to stockholders  the company experienced its most difficult year ever in the adverse jury verdict in the island mortgage network  inc island mortgage or imn litigation coupled with a difficult interest rate environment resulting from an essentially flat yield curve provided significant operating and non operating challenges for management and the board of directors throughout the past year 
management expects that the upcoming year will again provide difficult challenges as the company appeals the imn decision while facing similar interest rate issues as well as a host of competitors for its traditional small business and middle market commercial and industrial customer base 
competition in the company s tri county trade area continues to intensify with each passing year from a variety of new and existing competitors through de novo branching  acquisition and strategic alliances 
the company will continue to focus on its core business strengths of careful expansion of the loan and lease portfolios  expense reduction initiatives  capital management and strategies to improve noninterest income generation 
state bank of long island opened its sixteenth branch facility in westbury  long island in january of and early indications are that this location will provide excellent deposit and loan growth opportunities from a strategic location on a main thoroughfare contiguous to an industrial park in the heart of nassau county 
during  the company continued to expand its staff of professional bankers in the areas of branch banking  professional services deposit generation and commercial lending 
industry consolidation continues to provide the company with the opportunity to add experienced  relationship oriented bankers to its staff to support future growth and market penetration 
several strategic technology upgrades and new products are expected to be introduced in to support branch deposit growth and improve cross selling efforts in all areas of the organization 
by continuing our long standing philosophy of measured  orderly growth  maintaining a customer first attitude and adhering to the ideals contained in our mission statement which are continually reinforced by our board of directors and executive management team  the company has been able to apply a consistent standard of excellence honed over many years that management is hopeful will again produce a productive year during critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates the discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of the company are based on the consolidated financial statements  which are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
management evaluates those estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis  including those related to the allowance for probable loan losses  income taxes  other than temporary impairment of investment securities and recognition of contingent liabilities 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other factors and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these form the basis for making judgments on the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents allowance for probable loan losses in management s opinion  one of the most critical accounting policies impacting the company s financial statements is the evaluation of the allowance for probable loan losses 
management carefully monitors the credit quality of the loan portfolio and  on a quarterly basis  charges off the amounts of those loans deemed uncollectible 
management evaluates the fair value of collateral supporting the impaired loans using independent appraisals and other measures of fair value 
this process involves subjective judgments and assumptions and is subject to change based on factors that may be outside the control of the company 
management of the company recognizes that  despite its best efforts to minimize risk through a rigorous credit review process  losses will occur 
in times of economic slowdown  either regional or national  the risk inherent in the company s loan portfolio will increase 
the timing and amount of loan losses that occur are dependent upon several factors  most notably qualitative and quantitative factors about both the micro and macro economic conditions as reflected in the loan portfolio and the economy as a whole 
factors considered in this evaluation include  but are not limited to  estimated losses from loan and other credit arrangements  general economic conditions  changes in credit concentrations or pledged collateral  historical loan loss experience and trends in portfolio volume  maturity  composition  delinquencies and nonaccruals 
the allowance for probable loan losses is available to absorb charge offs from any loan category 
additions to the allowance are made through the provision for probable loan losses  which is a charge to operating earnings 
the adequacy of the provision and the resulting allowance for probable loan losses is determined by management s continuing review of the loan portfolio  including identification and review of individual problem situations that may affect a borrower s ability to repay  delinquency and nonperforming loan data  collateral values  regulatory examination results and changes in the size and character of the loan portfolio 
thus  an increase in the size of the loan portfolio or in any of its components could necessitate an increase in the allowance even though credit quality and problem loan totals may be improving 
accounting for income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 which requires the recording of deferred income taxes that reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
management exercises significant judgment in the evaluation of the amount and timing of the recognition of the resulting tax assets and liabilities and the judgments and estimates required for the evaluation are periodically updated based upon changes in business factors and the tax laws 
the company s new york state income taxes are under examination for the years ended december   and at this time  management believes it is more likely than not that tax positions taken by the company will be upheld and that no material additional taxes will be due 
as such  no liability has been recognized in the consolidated balance sheets at december  or 
table of contents other than temporary impairment of investment securities if the company deems any investment security s decline in market value to be other than temporary  the security is written down to a new cost basis and the resulting loss is charged against earnings 
the determination of whether a decline in market value is other than temporary is necessarily a matter of subjective judgment 
the timing and amount of any realized losses reported in the company s financial statements could vary if management s conclusions were to change as to whether an other than temporary impairment exists 
consideration is given to the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer and the intent and ability of the company to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
in analyzing an issuer s financial condition  the company s management considers whether the securities are issued by the us government or its agencies  whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred and industry analysts reports 
the company s management currently conducts impairment evaluations at least on a quarterly basis and has concluded that  at december   there were no other than temporary impairments of the company s investment securities 
recognition of contingent liabilities the company and the bank are subject to proceedings and claims that arise in the normal course of business 
management assesses the likelihood of any adverse outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
there can be no assurance that actual outcomes will not differ from those assessments 
a liability is recognized in the company s consolidated balance sheets if such liability is both probable and estimable 
results of operations and financial condition summary of financial performance the company recorded a net loss of million during versus net income of million in the loss resulted from expenses incurred as a result of the imn litigation 
a basic loss per common share of was recorded in versus earnings per common share of a year ago per share earnings have been adjusted to reflect the impact of a six for five stock split paid by the company during

a significant increase in legal expenses related to the imn litigation  in particular a million expense resulting from an adverse jury verdict in the warehouse lender case captioned hsa residential mortgage services of texas v 
state bank of long island  along with a slightly narrower net interest margin were the reasons for the loss 
growth in net interest income coupled with a lower provision for probable loan losses contributed positively to operating income during the increase in net interest income resulted from an expanded interest earning asset base  primarily through growth in commercial loans and commercial mortgages and leases originated at swlc 
revenue of state bancorp  inc dollars in thousands for the years ended december  over under net interest income service charges on deposit accounts net security gains income from bank owned life insurance other operating income total revenue the company s capital position  by all industry standard measures  remains strong 
the ratio of average total stockholders equity to average total assets was and in and  respectively 
based upon banking industry regulatory guidelines  a well capitalized institution must maintain a tier i leverage ratio of at least and tier i and total capital to risk weighted assets ratios of at least and  respectively 
at december   the company s tier i leverage ratio was while its risk weighted ratios were for tier i capital and for total capital 
the tier i leverage and tier i capital to risk weighted assets ratios are in excess of the regulatory guidelines for a well capitalized institution while the total capital to risk weighted assets ratio is not 
however  the total capital to risk weighted assets ratio does exceed the regulatory minimum guideline 
the decline in the company s year end capital ratios from the comparable date resulted from the net loss recorded during as a result of the aforementioned imn related legal expenses incurred primarily during the third and fourth quarters of the year 

table of contents as a result of the company s net loss in  each of the primary measures of financial performance declined during the past year 
return on average equity decreased to from a year ago 
return on average assets decreased to in versus in as a result of the unusually flat slope of the yield curve prevalent throughout  the company s net interest margin tax equivalent basis narrowed by five basis points to from a year ago 
the company s primary market area of nassau  suffolk and queens counties  provides ample opportunity for deposit growth and commercial and residential lending 
well over four million people live and work in this contiguous area and over thousand businesses also call this home 
higher real estate values and consumer spending continued to drive the local economy during  albeit at a slower pace than in recent years 
the diversity of the local marketplace combined with a highly educated work force has produced a fertile growth area for small business creation  particularly in the high tech  medical  biotech and services sectors 
the company s lending  cash management and deposit products have been developed to address the diverse credit related needs of the businesses  municipalities and residents in this area 
continued growth in consumer  business  professional services and municipal deposits is expected to fund projected loan growth in loan demand once again improved during on a year over year basis  total gross loans and leases grew  on average  by versus on a spot basis  year end loans and leases outstanding were million or above the comparable date 
consumer spending again supported the local and national economies during  however  an increase in business demand and investment was also evident during the year 
mortgage refinance activity  while not at levels experienced several years ago  improved somewhat in higher real estate values continued to provide a wealth effect for consumers that propelled spending throughout the year 
however  as a result of the increased volatility of world events  growth in short term interest rates and the continued overall weakness of the us dollar  many businesses have yet to increase their capital investment in infrastructure to support expansion in a meaningful way 
many economic signs point to a more pronounced economic expansion during for the corporate sector throughout the country  a critical element of the company s core business model 
the company enters hopeful that an improved outlook for its business clientele will translate into greater demand for all varieties of credit and deposit products 
management of the company is  however  well aware that any economic improvement is inextricably linked to both the outlook for interest rates and  more importantly  the shape of the yield curve 
these issues  coupled with volatile geopolitical events occurring half a world away from the company s trade area  may also negatively impact near term economic growth 
management of the company has historically been very conservative with respect to granting credit to current and prospective borrowers 
coupled with the continued economic uncertainty both locally and nationally  management expects that loan growth of approximately to in the company s core competencies of commercial and industrial credits  commercial mortgages and equipment leasing will be achieved in it is expected that spreads will continue to tighten as competitive pressures and a flat interest rate yield curve result in thin margins on most loan offerings 
funding costs are expected to rise during as the federal open market committee fomc  under new leadership  may increase the overnight funds rate by up to an additional to basis points from current levels 
although the asset sensitivity inherent in the company s balance sheet would normally result in an improved net interest margin in a period of rising rates  the lack of slope in the yield curve is expected to mitigate this improvement again in management expects that  absent a change in the shape of the yield curve  the company s net interest margin will decline modestly in from current levels 
excluding the loan portfolio  asset growth in will likely come from the fixed income investment portfolio  primarily in the medium duration  taxable area 
the company s branch network is expected to provide low cost core deposit funding to support anticipated asset growth 
the company will continue to aggressively pursue product delivery expense reductions and operating efficiencies along with revenue generating sales initiatives to improve net income 
net interest income versus net interest income  the difference between interest earned on loans and investments and interest paid on deposits and borrowed funds  is the company s primary source of operating earnings 
net interest income is influenced by the average balance and mix of the company s interest earning assets  the yield on those assets and the current level of market interest rates 
these rates are significantly influenced by the actions of the fomc  which periodically adjusts the federal funds rate  the rate at which banks borrow funds from one another on an overnight basis 
during  the fomc increased the federal funds rate eight times from its low of to its year end level of 
since  the fomc has increased the fed funds rate consecutive times by a total of basis points 

table of contents during  net interest income increased by to million 
this improvement was driven by an increase in average interest earning assets of million  primarily loans and short term investments 
growth in commercial loans  commercial mortgages and lease receivables led the million or increase in average loans outstanding to million in versus the loan growth resulted from several sources  most notably our relationships with experienced builders that the company has successfully worked with for many years  commercial lending opportunities developed in queens county and expansion of the equipment leasing portfolio 
management of the company expects that economic growth in will provide additional opportunity for the company s equipment leasing subsidiary  swlc  to further expand its portfolio 
swlc has expanded beyond its traditional base of computer and office equipment over the past five years through cross sell opportunities developed by the bank s relationship officers 
average short term investments  principally reverse repurchase agreements used to collateralize municipal balances  increased by million in average investment securities declined by million to million primarily due to a lack of economically advantageous reinvestment opportunity due to the flat yield curve prevailing throughout cash flows from the bank s mortgage backed portfolio and maturing short term municipal investments were utilized  in part  to support loan growth 
short term under one year tax exempt municipal securities and mortgage backed securities declined by million and million  respectively 
somewhat offsetting this contraction was an increase of million in us government agency securities 
as of december   approximately of the company s investment portfolio was owned and managed by sb portfolio 
average interest earning assets have grown by  and in  and  respectively 
low cost core deposits  principally demand deposits  savings accounts and money market accounts  have funded the asset expansion during the past three years 
growth in each of these deposit categories offset reductions in both retail and large denomination certificates of deposit and served to mitigate growth in the company s cost of funds in despite another year of higher short term interest rates 
average core deposit balances increased by million or to billion in the growth and retention of low cost core deposit balances is one of the company s top strategic priorities since the growth of these deposits is a key element in the company s expansion strategy 
these low cost deposits also are critical to the company s efforts to improve net income through the widest possible net interest margin 
during  average core deposit balances represented of total deposits  unchanged from and up from in the maturation of branches opened in the past three years  the expansion of the professional services group s book of business and an increase in municipal and commercial deposit relationships were responsible for growth in all core deposit categories 
average demand deposit balances grew by million or in and million or in average savings deposits expanded by million or on a year to year basis 
this growth resulted primarily from higher levels of rate indexed savings accounts up 
during  the company s fully taxable equivalent fte net interest margin contracted by five basis points to  from a year ago 
the narrower margin resulted from multiple factors  most notably higher short term interest rates and a flat yield curve which negatively impacted the return on cash flow generated by the company s investment portfolio 
as a result of a shift in the asset mix to a greater dependence on loans and leases as a percentage of total interest earning assets  the company s yield on average interest earning assets expanded by basis points to 
higher short term interest rates  partially offset by continued growth in low cost sources of core funding  resulted in an basis point increase in the average rate paid on the company s supporting funds to in

further increases in short term rates will increase the company s cost of funds while a continuation of the flat yield curve from overnight funding out to ten years will create additional pricing pressure in the loan portfolio 
management expects that the recently opened westbury branch  the continued expansion of the company s existing retail branches and expected growth in the municipal and professional services sectors will provide access to additional low cost sources of funds as well as provide significant opportunity to expand the company s loan portfolio 
the company has been very successful in its efforts to develop loan growth in queens county and will continue to strategically target this market during other specific geographic areas such as northwestern nassau county  the deer park corridor and the south shore of western suffolk county along with additional residential development financing are expected to provide ample opportunity for portfolio growth over the next year 
management of the company expects that the existing formula of high touch personal service delivered by experienced relationship officers  coupled with customers dissatisfied with the degradation of their service quality resulting from consolidation of the local banking market  will again produce numerous commercial and municipal banking relationship opportunities for both deposits and loans that will improve profitability in and beyond 
average total loans grew by  and in  and  respectively 
at the same time that this growth has been achieved  credit quality in the company s loan portfolio has improved each year 
nonaccrual loans declined to million or of total loans as of december   the lowest level in years  while the allowance for probable loan losses as a percentage of nonaccrual loans has risen to  its highest level in years 
although short term rates increased again during  they remained low enough to support growth in residential construction and remodeling and commercial real estate development expansion  each of which is only expected to abate in the next few years because of a finite amount of available land in the bank s trade area 
these factors  along with a targeted queens county calling effort  the fallout from the exit of a major lender from the local commercial marketplace during and an expanded commercial lending staff were the primary reasons for the growth in the company s loan portfolio during the past year 
management of the company expects additional opportunity for loan growth during the next twelve months as the result of additional penetration in the queens marketplace  a large and diverse market with over  businesses and two million residents  where the company has only begun to improve its corporate visibility in the past five years 
a suite of competitive loan and deposit products  along with numerous equipment leasing options offered by swlc  provide commercial lenders  business development officers and branch managers with an array of products suitable for most types of relationships 
these products  coupled with responsive  personal customer service provided by a group of highly experienced bankers  will enable the company to take advantage of opportunities presented by the consolidation of the local banking market as well as provide an entr e into any new markets that demonstrate an opportunity to enhance stockholder value 

table of contents average commercial loans  mortgages and leases grew at rates of  and  respectively  in at december   total gross loans and leases outstanding amounted to million  up when compared to the comparable date 
the year end loan portfolio was composed of approximately commercial mortgages  commercial loans  residential mortgages and home equity lines of credit and all other loans and leases 
it is expected that the loan mix will remain  on a percentage basis  approximately the same as based upon recent local and national economic forecasts  management of the company anticipates that loans outstanding will grow at a rate of to in the continued consolidation of the new york city and long island banking markets still provides the greatest potential for loan growth 
as local and national money center and regional bank competitors continue to enter the local market through acquisition and de novo branching strategies  many retail  commercial and municipal customers will benefit from a stable  locally run community bank with an excellent reputation  a proven service model and a strong capital base 
management of the company is committed to high quality loan growth 
a comprehensive credit review process provides a quality control tool that attempts to ensure that only high quality loans are brought to the credit committee for consideration 
this rigorous process is of paramount importance as the company attempts to grow market share while competing with far larger institutions by offering an improved product mix during and beyond 
versus net interest income increased by to million during as the result of growth in average interest earning assets of million up 
growth in loans and tax exempt municipal securities accounted for much of the asset expansion 
increases in commercial loans  commercial mortgages and lease receivables led the million or increase in average loans outstanding in versus average investment securities grew by million or due to growth of million short term under one year tax exempt municipal securities 
somewhat offsetting this growth was a million decline in mortgage backed issues 
primarily funding the growth in interest earning assets was a million increase in core deposits  representing of total deposits in versus in growth in demand deposits million and savings balances million accounted for the core deposit expansion in during  the company s net interest rate margin narrowed to from in the prior year 
the reduced margin resulted from multiple factors  most notably higher short term interest rates and a flattening of the yield curve which negatively impacted the return on cash flow generated by the company s investment portfolio 
despite a shift in the asset mix to a greater dependence on loans and leases as a percentage of total earning assets  the company s earning asset yield declined by eight basis points to

requires the company  at the time of purchase  to designate each investment security as either available for sale afs  held to maturity or trading  depending upon investment objectives  liquidity needs and ultimate intent 
afs securities are stated at market value  with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of stockholders equity until realized 
securities held to maturity are stated at cost  adjusted for amortization of premium or accretion of discount  if any 
trading securities are generally purchased with the intent of capitalizing on short term price differences by selling them in the near term 
the company did not hold any trading securities at december  and at december   the company held million in afs securities of the investment portfolio at a pre tax unrealized net loss of million versus an unrealized net loss of thousand at year end at year end  the afs portfolio was divided into the following categories corporate and other securities  tax exempt municipal paper  callable us government agency securities  and mortgage backed securities mbs mainly fnma and gnma obligations 
the held to maturity portion of the portfolio  which totaled million  was composed entirely of agency securities 

table of contents after two years of relatively favorable bond market conditions  the yield curve flattened in creating a challenging interest rate environment 
in light of the flat yield curve  along with an upward bias in short term interest rates  the company maintained its defensive investment posture 
presented with difficult bond market conditions throughout most of the year  a conservative portfolio was maintained with the objective of generating cash flow to be redeployed opportunistically in a rising rate environment 
the company s investment policy is conservative in nature and identifies liquidity and safety as being of paramount importance among its objectives and  as such  the portfolio is largely comprised of government agency securities  mbs issues of government sponsored entities and local municipal notes 
in addition to the creation of liquidity  risk management is another important aspect of the company s investment strategy 
the company s portfolio construction is designed accordingly so as to provide liquidity while managing market risk and avoiding taking on credit risk 
market risk can be defined as the sensitivity of the portfolio s market value to changes in the level of interest rates  and is managed  primarily  by investing in shorter lived securities 
a shorter lived security is preferred to a longer dated maturity in a rising rate environment because the longer the maturity of a security  the greater the sensitivity of its market value to changes in interest rates 
security selection is governed by the company s investment policy  and serves to supplement the company s asset liability position 
securities such as callable agencies  premium mbs issues and floating rate securities with an anticipated short average life were purchased during the past year with the intention of producing cash flow  as well as limiting the sensitivity of the portfolio s market value 
in addition to attaining a short average life  the securities purchased provide incremental yield due to optionality found in callable government agency securities and prepayment activity inherent in mbs issues 
cash flow on the portfolio increases in a lower interest rate environment and moderately extends in a higher interest rate environment 
the defensive posture of the portfolio  with a continuing emphasis on liquidity and risk management  remains a prudent strategy and is expected to continue for the foreseeable future 
the company s investment portfolio decreased by thousand at year end versus the comparable date primarily as the result of reductions in tax exempt municipal securities down million  mbs issues down million and corporate securities down million which were offset by growth in government agency securities up million 
the company took advantage of accelerated principal paydowns on mbs issues to strategically position a portion of the investment portfolio during the year 
local  short term municipal paper is sold throughout the year as part of the company s asset liability management function 
the company s holdings of agency securities increased during as these issues provided the best risk adjusted reward among the allowable investments in the company s investment policy 
the government agency issues that are callable have call periods within two years and most have final maturities of less than ten years 
the notes are aaa credits that provide a competitive yield in excess of the company s funding cost and are eligible to pledge to secure municipal deposits and other borrowings and  therefore  are an integral part of the company s funding strategy 
the mbs issues held by the company have a medium term average life with most final maturities less than twenty years 
the company s portfolio of tax exempt municipal notes decreased as part of a strategic repositioning of the investment portfolio in the first half of in advance of further anticipated upward trends in rates 
the company continues to expand its municipal relationships and  as a natural outgrowth of that business  purchases short term one year or less municipal paper to support those relationships 
the company received mbs principal paydowns of million and million in and  respectively 
management expects that the trend toward lower paydowns will continue in due to declining refinance opportunities available to the consumer in the face of higher forecasted interest rates 
the company s investment portfolio is very low risk in nature due to its concentration of us government agency  local municipal notes and aaa rated mbs issues 
as of december   the mbs portfolio had an average life of approximately years after adjusting for historical prepayment patterns 
approximately of the mbs portfolio  including collateralized mortgage obligations cmos  had final maturities in excess of ten years 
in general  principal prepayments on these securities will slow as interest rates rise and  conversely  prepayments will increase as interest rates fall 
cmos accounted for of the total investment portfolio as of year end the government agency portfolio has final maturities ranging from one to fifteen years and those that are callable have call dates in and 
table of contents the company s investment subsidiary  sb portfolio  contributed significantly to the success of the company during this subsidiary now holds and manages approximately of the company s investment portfolio 
the majority of securities domiciled with sb portfolio are government agency and mbs and a portion of its portfolio also includes long term tax exempt paper 
sb portfolio has its own investment policy and board of directors  however  it still adheres to the stringent safety and quality standards present throughout the company in its investment evaluation process 
management of the company expects that sb portfolio will continue to grow during through the reinvestment of its own interest income as well as through additional capital infusions from the parent company if market conditions warrant 
the company provided million in additional capital to sb portfolio during summary of loan loss experience and allowance for probable loan losses one of management s primary objectives is to maintain a high quality loan portfolio in all economic climates 
this objective is achieved by maintaining high underwriting standards coupled with regular evaluation of each borrower s creditworthiness and risk exposure 
management seeks to avoid loan concentrations within industries and customer segments in order to minimize credit exposure 
the company s senior lending personnel work in conjunction with loan officers to determine the level of risk in the company s loan related assets and establish an adequate level for the allowance for probable loan losses 
an outside loan review consultant is also utilized to independently verify the loan classifications and the adequacy of the allowance for probable loan losses 
management actively seeks to reduce the level of nonperforming assets  defined as nonaccrual loans and other real estate owned  through aggressive collection efforts and  where necessary  litigation and charge off 
other real estate owned properties are aggressively marketed for sale utilizing local commercial and residential realtors as appropriate 
as illustrated in table i  the company s nonperforming assets decreased by million to million at year end versus following a million decrease in versus at december   total nonperforming assets as a percentage of loans and other real estate owned amounted to as compared to and at year end and  respectively 
the company held one commercial property in other real estate owned at year end with a carrying value of million 
this property was sold during at a small gain 
the year end decline in nonperforming assets  as defined by the company  resulted from a million decrease in nonaccrual loans coupled with the aforementioned sale of the other real estate owned property of million 
the reduction in nonaccrual loans during resulted from the upgrade of several commercial credits to performing status coupled with a combination of paydowns and charge offs 
management of the company actively reviews the level and composition of nonperforming assets 
during  this meant a continuation of the strategy of collection through proactive litigation combined with enhanced collateral positions on virtually all nonperforming assets 
the decrease in nonperforming assets resulted in improved coverage ratios at year end 
the allowance for probable loan losses as a percentage of nonaccrual loans advanced to from at year end  while the allowance for probable loan losses as a percentage of nonaccrual loans  restructured accruing loans and loans days or more past due and still accruing interest increased to during from a year ago 
at december   the company had no restructured accruing loans 
loans in this category are composed mainly of loans that have demonstrated performance in accordance with the terms of their restructure agreements but do not yield a market rate of interest subsequent to their restructuring 
based on current economic conditions  management has determined that the current level of the allowance for probable loan losses is adequate in relation to the probable incurred losses present in the portfolio 
management considers many factors in this analysis  among them credit risk grades assigned to commercial  industrial and commercial real estate loans  delinquency trends  concentrations within segments of the loan portfolio  recent charge off experience and local economic conditions 
commercial loans are assigned credit risk grades using a scale of one to ten 
allocations for probable incurred losses are made for pools of similar risk graded loans 
for loans with signs of credit deterioration  generally loans in grades seven through ten  allocations range from to of the loan balance and are based on the company s historical loss experience for the respective grade category

the potential consequences of a continued increase in interest rates or a prolonged economic slowdown in industries which impact the company s borrower base make it difficult to forecast the impact on asset quality that will result during or any additional charge offs that may be required during the year 
it is the present intent of management to continue to monitor the level of the allowance for probable loan losses in order to properly reflect the exposure  if any  represented by fluctuations in the local real estate market and the underlying value that that market provides as collateral to certain segments of the loan portfolio 
in recognition of the economic uncertainties previously elaborated upon  the normal risks inherent in any credit portfolio and expected growth in the loan portfolio  management anticipates that the provision for loan losses will approximate the level recorded in the provision is continually evaluated relative to portfolio risk and regulatory guidelines and will continue to be closely reviewed throughout the coming year 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  closely review the allowance for probable loan losses

in the course of those bankruptcy cases  it has been alleged that island mortgage engaged in a widespread pattern of fraud directed at lenders  title agents  closing companies and others with whom island mortgage regularly dealt 
a number of island mortgage s creditors have since asserted that the bank participated in island mortgage s alleged fraudulent scheme

the complaint alleges that plaintiffs extended lines of credit to  and entered into mortgage purchase agreements with  defendant island mortgage 
according to the complaint  millions of dollars of funds that plaintiffs deposited into the accounts at the bank maintained by island mortgage and its related entities to fund mortgages were misappropriated as the result of island mortgage s alleged scheme to defraud plaintiffs and unjustly enrich defendants 
plaintiffs claim the following with respect to the bank the bank aided and abetted the allegedly fraudulent scheme perpetrated by island mortgage  the bank aided and abetted in a breach of the fiduciary duties an island mortgage affiliate allegedly owed to plaintiffs  and  the bank was negligent in failing to recognize and act on signs that island mortgage was allegedly misappropriating the funds plaintiffs advanced to island mortgage 
plaintiffs claim they are entitled to not less than million  plus interest and punitive damages 

table of contents on january   the bankruptcy court ruled on the bank s motion for summary judgment 
the plaintiffs claims for negligence and aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty were dismissed 
the claim for aiding and abetting fraud was not dismissed  although the court ruled that one of the plaintiffs matrix could not seek damages for the period after june  on october   the bank announced a settlement with household and an agreement in principle with matrix with respect to each of their separate claims 
the matrix agreement is now fully executed

on january   the jury rendered a verdict awarding million in compensatory damages to plaintiff rmst 
prejudgment interest which will exceed million  in addition to certain other potential compensatory damages which have not yet been ruled upon by the court  could bring the total judgment to approximately million

the bank believes it has a number of meritorious arguments for its post verdict motion and a possible appeal to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit and will pursue its rights vigorously  however  the ultimate outcome of the imn lawsuits cannot be predicted with certainty 
it also remains possible that other parties may pursue additional claims against the bank related to the bank s dealings with imn and its affiliates 
the bank s legal fees and expenses will continue to be significant  and those costs  in addition to any costs associated with settling the imn related litigations or satisfying any adverse judgments  could have a material adverse effect on the bank s results of operations or financial position 
in addition to the litigations noted above  the company and the bank are subject to other legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business 
in the opinion of management  the amount of ultimate liability  if any  with respect to such matters will not materially affect future operations and will not have a material impact on the company s financial statements

salaries and other employee benefits increased by million during as the result of staff expansion coupled with higher medical and pension costs 
the creation of a professional services group psg in  the addition of several commercial lending officers in early and the opening of a new branch in westbury accounted for much of the company s growth in staff 
increased health care costs  fica and payroll tax expenses  and related increases in k and employee stock ownership plan esop contributions added to the growth in salaries and benefits costs during also contributing to the growth in operating expenses during were higher levels of occupancy costs  marketing and advertising expenses and audit and assessment fees 
occupancy costs grew by as the result of additional space occupied by the psg staff  higher utility costs and increased maintenance and repair expenses incurred during marketing and advertising expenses increased by as the result of additional product promotions and corporate image advertising 
audit and assessment costs grew by due to higher costs related to sarbanes oxley compliance 
somewhat offsetting the foregoing increases were reductions in equipment expense  credit and collection expenses and other operating expenses 
excluding all imn related expenses in both and would have resulted in a year over year cost increase of in versus 
table of contents excluding imn related costs  the growth in total operating expenses recorded by the company during is reflective of the company s recent trend as it has expanded its branch network and corporate infrastructure since the expense increases experienced during and were primarily due to increases in staff to support growth in the company s core business model while the higher expenses recorded in and were due primarily to the previously noted imn litigation  the acquisition of swlc in and the opening of five new branch offices during the same period 
wherever possible  the company strives to embrace and utilize existing and emerging technologies to enhance productivity to reduce the level of staff and infrastructure necessary to support the growth and expansion of the company s primary lines of business 
management continues to pursue a goal of reducing the company s operating efficiency ratio total operating expenses divided by the sum of fully taxable equivalent net interest income and other income  excluding net security gains or losses to a level below  commensurate with our high performing peers 
this goal can only be accomplished through a combination of revenue growth and stringent expense control in all areas 
although the expansion of staff and branch facilities in recent years  along with growth in both the lending staff and operational support functions  has resulted in rates of operating expense growth above corporate targets  management is confident that these investments in the company s core business model will pay dividends in the coming years 
total operating expenses will decline in as a result of significant imn related costs absorbed during significant expenses associated with an appeal of the imn jury verdict will continue to be incurred in however  those costs will not be quantifiable until a final judgment amount has been determined by the court 
excluding imn related expenses  the company expects core operating expenses to rise at a rate of approximately to in as the result of the opening of the new branch in westbury in january  higher projected medical and pension expenses and the planned addition to staff of several lending officers to support the company s core commercial lending function in expense control measures  including strict guidelines with respect to increases in base and supplementary compensation for current staff  will continue to be observed 
excluding the impact of any imn related expenses  which are not yet specifically quantifiable  the company s management expects that the projected expansion of the company s asset and revenue bases will offset expected growth in the company s operating expenses 
the rate of growth in loans  core deposit balances and fee based sources of revenue planned for the coming year is expected to more than offset the anticipated increase in operating expenses that comes with normal growth and expansion 
the company s primary expense control rates of measurement are the operating efficiency ratio and the ratio of total operating expenses to average assets 
as a result of the adverse imn jury verdict  the company s operating efficiency ratio is not statistically meaningful for analytical purposes 
excluding imn settlement and jury verdict expenses  the company s operating efficiency ratio would have been versus and in and  respectively 
prior to the imn litigation and the recent branch expansion program  the company s efficiency ratio was in it is one of management s primary strategic objectives to reduce the efficiency ratio to this level once again 
the second measure of expense control utilized by the company is total operating expenses to average assets 
excluding imn settlement and jury verdict expenses  the company recorded ratios of in and and in and  respectively  in this category 
management of the company is extremely cognizant of expense management and places great emphasis on control of operating expenses  but always in the context of prudent growth and expansion of the company s branch network and of profitable lines of business with a quantifiable return on equity and accretive impact on earnings per share 
management is also aware  however  that the appropriate resources necessary to grow the company s revenue base must also be made available in order to improve earnings for the long term 
along these lines  management also monitors the ratio of average assets per fte employee and  at over million per employee  the company ranks in the top of its peer group in this category 
this efficient utilization of staff is another reason behind the company s historically excellent record of growth in earnings and assets 
rates of growth in both net interest income and other income are expected to outpace increases in operating expenses excluding imn related expenses in the coming year  thereby resulting in anticipated improvements in each of the foregoing expense control ratios in the company s long term goal  as stated in numerous previous stockholder communications  continues to be to reduce its operating efficiency ratio to a level of or less and to lower the operating expenses to average assets ratio to or lower 
while this is not expected to occur during  largely as the result of costs related to the imn litigation  it remains a long term objective to continually improve these ratios in both absolute terms and in relation to the company s community bank peer group 
an analysis of the remaining components of operating expenses  by category  follows 

table of contents occupancy expenses totaled million in  an increase of when compared to this increase resulted from a combination of higher rental expenses  increased maintenance costs and higher utilities and depreciation expenses 
the increase in rental costs in up resulted principally from additional space occupied at our mineola location during the past year coupled with the full year impact of costs associated with a small office leased in new york city for the professional services group in mid real estate taxes rose very modestly in when compared to the prior year as the result of nominally higher commercial property tax rates assessed on the company s branches in building and leasehold depreciation grew by as the result of additional depreciable tenant improvements during while utility costs rose by from year to year 
maintenance and repair costs grew by  primarily the result of snow removal costs during the winter of occupancy costs are expected to rise at a noticeably slower rate in as the costs of the new branch in westbury are largely offset by lower projected rates of growth in utilities and maintenance costs and anticipated tax certiorari proceedings which are currently pending 
equipment expenses decreased by to million in as the result of a reduction in computer equipment depreciation related to the company s mainframe system 
also contributing to this decrease were lower computer software depreciation and lower equipment maintenance insurance fees 
management of the company expects equipment expenses to increase moderately in as several technology initiatives are expected to be funded and additional equipment purchased to support branch expansion 
legal expenses  as previously noted  increased by million during ninety nine percent of the company s legal expenses relate to the ongoing imn litigation previously disclosed in the company s securities and exchange commission filings  including a charge of million resulting from an adverse jury verdict rendered on january  in one of the imn related cases 
management of the company expects that additional expenses will be incurred related to this litigation during  the extent of which is not specifically quantifiable at this time 
marketing and advertising costs increased by thousand during when compared to this growth resulted principally from additional corporate branding efforts coupled with product specific promotions 
a more targeted approach to event sponsorships during based on customer profitability  coupled with a reduction in promotions related expenses served to offset somewhat the company s other initiatives 
it is expected that this expense category will increase next year as the result of the new branch opening and expected costs to be incurred in connection with the company s ongoing corporate branding and community outreach efforts 
stringent cost control measures will continue to be applied to this expense category in the next twelve months 
credit and collection costs declined by thousand in versus reduced expenses associated with loan collection work  principally due to continued improvement in the overall quality of the loan and lease portfolio  accounted for the bulk of the decline in this category 
also contributing to this decrease were lower costs associated with credit reports and credit checks as the result of a reduced level of residential mortgage refinancing activity in audit and assessment fees increased by thousand or in versus as a result of higher costs associated with the implementation of the sarbanes oxley act sox 
audit and assessment expenses have increased by approximately over the past two years as costs associated with sox compliance have been borne by the company 
it is expected that audit and assessment fees will decline in as a result of a change in outside audit firms during coupled with reduced sox related expenses as the start up phase of complying with this legislation has concluded 
other operating expenses declined by to million in versus this reduction resulted from improvements in several expense categories  most notably other real estate expenses  director compensation costs and correspondent bank service charges 
other real estate expenses  specifically real estate taxes paid  decreased during as a commercial property foreclosed on during was sold during the year at a small gain 
somewhat offsetting these positive factors were increases in several expense categories  mainly meetings and seminars  travel and entertainment and fdic and new york state banking department assessment expenses 
management of the company expects that operating expenses  in absolute terms  will continue to grow as the company expands its operations  the markets it serves and the products it offers 
management anticipates an overall rate of increase of to as an expense growth estimate for  not including litigation expenses associated with imn 

table of contents versus operating expenses declined by to million during higher levels of salaries and employee benefits costs  increased occupancy and growth in other operating expenses were more than offset by reductions in legal expenses  marketing and advertising  equipment and credit and collection costs 
salaries and employee benefits costs rose by million in versus as the result of the creation of psg coupled with growth in staff in several other areas of the company 
increased supplementary compensation costs  health care  fica expenses  and related increases in k and employee stock ownership plan contributions also added to the growth in this category 
occupancy costs grew by in to million due principally to higher real estate taxes up  additional space occupied by psg in new york city and increased utility expenses 
equipment expenses decreased by to million in as the result of a reduction in computer equipment depreciation related to the company s mainframe system 
also contributing to this decrease were lower equipment rental and repair costs and lower equipment maintenance insurance fees 
legal expenses  primarily related to the imn litigation  declined by million or during marketing and advertising costs decreased by thousand during this decrease resulted principally from a more targeted approach to event sponsorships coupled with a reduction in promotions expenses as no new branches were opened by the company during credit and collection costs declined by thousand in versus this improvement was the result of a significant reduction in loan collection work resulting from fewer nonperforming assets due to an improvement in portfolio credit quality

effective income tax rate versus and an income tax credit of million was recorded in while tax provisions of million and million were recorded in and  respectively 
the tax credit resulted from the loss recorded by the company during the company is currently subject to both a statutory incremental federal tax rate of for the first million of taxable income  and a new york state tax rate of  plus a surcharge of 
the company s overall effective tax rate for those years that a tax provision was recorded was and in and  respectively 
the decrease in s effective tax rate was due to a higher level of tax exempt income coupled with a reduction in fully taxable net security gains 
sb portfolio  which provides investment management services to the bank and the company  managed approximately million  million and million in assets at year end  and  respectively  primarily mbs  government agency and tax exempt municipal securities in delaware 
the income from these assets is exempt from new york state income taxes and totaled million in  including net gains on the sale of securities of million  million in  including net gains of million and million in  including net gains of million 
management of the company anticipates that the consolidated effective tax rate will be similar to that of at an approximate rate of between and 
the company has received preliminary findings of a new york state department of taxation and finance the department field audit with respect to new york franchise tax for the years ended december   and the department contends that the company s tax liability should be increased by  including almost  in penalties and interest  and interest continues to accrue for the years under examination 
after deducting the estimated federal tax benefit arising from this matter in the amount of  the company s net tax liability would be approximately  this increase in tax appears to be based on the department s assertion that sb financial and sb portfolio  which are organized and operated entirely outside of the state of new york  should be included in the company s new york state combined franchise tax reports 
if the department were to successfully assert the same position for calendar years   and  management estimates that the additional franchise tax liability for these years including interest would be approximately  after taking into consideration the estimated federal tax benefit 

table of contents the company disagrees with the department s findings and intends to vigorously contest any assessment based upon these findings through appropriate administrative and  if necessary  court proceedings 
at this time  management believes it is more likely than not that the company will succeed in refuting the department s position 
accordingly  no liability or reserve has been recognized in the consolidated balance sheets at december  or with respect to this matter 
however  no assurance can be given as to whether or to what extent the company will be required to pay the amount of the tax liability asserted by the department or whether additional tax will be assessed for years subsequent to calendar year off balance sheet arrangements the bank is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby and documentary letters of credit 
those instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
the bank uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on balance sheet instruments 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
the bank evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral obtained  if deemed necessary by the bank upon extension of credit  is based on management s credit evaluation of the customer 
collateral required varies  but may include accounts receivable  inventory  equipment  real estate and income producing commercial properties 
at december  and  commitments to originate loans and commitments under unused lines of credit for which the bank is obligated amounted to approximately  and  respectively 
approximately  and  of these commitments were at variable rates and  and  were at fixed rates at december  and  respectively 
at december  and  the fixed rate commitments had interest rates ranging from approximately to and to  respectively 
letters of credit are conditional commitments guaranteeing payments of drafts in accordance with the terms of the letter of credit agreements 
commercial letters of credit are used primarily to facilitate trade or commerce and are also issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements  bond financing and similar transactions 
collateral may be required to support letters of credit based upon management s evaluation of the creditworthiness of each customer 
the credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers 
most letters of credit expire within one year 
at december  and  the bank had letters of credit outstanding of approximately  and  respectively 
at december   the uncollateralized portion was approximately  the bank s use of derivative financial instruments  ie interest rate swaps  exposes it to credit risk 
this credit exposure relates to possible losses that would be recognized if the counterparties fail to perform their obligations under the contracts 
to mitigate this credit exposure  the bank deals only with counterparties of good credit standing and requires the exchange of collateral over a certain credit threshold 
during  the bank executed customer interest rate swap transactions together with offsetting interest rate swap transactions with institutional dealers 
at december   the total gross notional amount of swap transactions outstanding was  at december   the bank was party to two swap agreements that economically hedged a portion of the interest rate variability in its portfolio of prime rate loans 
the agreements effectively required the bank to pay prime interest rate and receive a fixed rate of from the counterparty on million of loan assets 
the fair value of the swap agreements was  inclusive of accrued interest of  contained within other assets in the consolidated balance sheets 
effective april   the bank terminated these two interest rate swap agreements in support of enhancing its interest rate sensitivity position 
the cost to unwind the swap agreements totaled  this amount  net of taxes of  included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  is being reclassified as a reduction in interest income using the straight line method over the remaining original term to september of the interest rate swaps in accordance with sfas no 
for the twelve months ended december   and  the company recognized interest income  net of expenses associated with unwinding the swap agreements  of   and  respectively  under the agreements

the company strives to maintain an efficient level of capital  commensurate with its risk profile  on which a competitive rate of return to stockholders will be realized over both the short and long term 
capital is managed to enhance stockholder value while providing flexibility for management to act opportunistically in a changing marketplace 
in determining an optimal capital level  the company also considers the capital levels of its peers and the evaluations of its primary regulators 
during  the company s capital was negatively impacted by the net loss recorded principally as a result of the imn jury verdict 
at december   stockholders equity totaled million versus million at year end the net loss of million  million in cash dividends paid on common stock and million in capital utilized to repurchase shares of the company s common stock reduced stockholders equity by million in during   shares of common stock were acquired in open market transactions as part of the company s stock repurchase plan 
approximately million in capital was allocated to purchase these shares at an average price of per share 
under the board of directors revised share repurchase authorization  management may repurchase up to  additional shares if market conditions warrant 
this action will only occur if management feels that the purchase will be at prices that are accretive to earnings per share and is the most efficient use of company capital 
the company does not presently intend to repurchase stock in somewhat offsetting the foregoing reductions to stockholders equity during was an increase of million from the reinvestment of dividends by stockholders participating in the company s dividend reinvestment plan 
internal capital generation  defined as earnings less cash dividends paid on common stock  is the primary catalyst expected to support the company s future growth of assets and stockholder value 
management continually evaluates the company s capital position in light of current and future growth objectives and regulatory guidelines 
during and  the company enhanced its tier i capital position through the issuance of a total of million in trust preferred securities  each through pooled offering structures 
the trust preferred securities  which currently qualify as tier i capital for regulatory capital purposes  were issued by newly established subsidiaries  state bancorp capital trusts i and ii

table of contents although the company may be dependent on bank dividends to pay the trust preferred interest  and the bank may not be able to declare dividends  the subordinated debentures allow for up to two extension periods of consecutive months each during which time payment of interest may be deferred by the company 
as such  the company would not be in default if it were unable to pay interest on the subordinated debentures

the company s primary source of income is dividends from the bank 
dividend payments from the bank are subject to regulatory limitations  generally based on capital levels and current and retained earnings  imposed by regulatory agencies with authority over the bank 
the ability of the bank to declare dividends is also subject to its profitability  financial condition  capital expenditures and other cash flow requirements 
currently  based on its capital levels and current and retained earnings  the bank is prohibited from declaring dividends without regulatory approval and it is unknown whether such approval will be granted 
the bank presently intends to make application for permission to declare dividends when deemed appropriate 
however  the company cannot make any assurances that the bank will be able to declare dividends at any specific time in the future

table of contents state bancorp  inc and its subsidiaries are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal reserve board and the federal deposit insurance corporation 
these regulatory authorities measure capital adequacy on a risk weighted assets basis 
their guidelines provide a method of monitoring capital adequacy that is sensitive to the risk factors inherent in a bank s asset base  including off balance sheet exposures 
the guidelines assign various weights to different asset types depending upon their risk profile 
generally speaking  assets with greater risk require more capital support than do less risky assets 
in addition  a leverage standard has been established to supplement the risk based ratios in assessing an institution s overall capital adequacy 
failure to maintain the bank s capital ratios in excess of minimum regulatory guidelines requires bank regulatory authorities to take prompt corrective action in accordance with the provisions of the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of fdicia 
the regulations arising from fdicia established five categories of capitalization for depository institutions well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized 
based upon its december  capital position as outlined in table ii  the bank s capital ratios exceed the minimum levels established for an adequately capitalized institution and exceed the minimum requirements under fdicia 
the bank s tier i leverage and tier i capital risk weighted assets ratios exceed the minimum requirements for a well capitalized institution  however  the total capital risk weighted assets ratio does not  thereby classifying the bank as adequately capitalized at year end as of december  and  the bank met each of the requirements to be considered a well capitalized institution 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain actions by regulators that could have a direct effect on the company s and the bank s operations and financial statements 
the company has no current plans or commitments for capital utilization or expenditures that would affect its current capital position or would impact its future financial performance 
table ii regulatory criteria for a well regulatory the bank s ratios as of december  capitalized minimum institution leverage ratio tier i capital to total adjusted assets tier i capital risk weighted assets total capital risk weighted assets liquidity liquidity management is defined as the company s ability to meet its financial obligations on a continuous basis without material loss or disruption of normal operations 
these obligations include the withdrawal of deposits on demand or at their contractual maturity  the repayment of borrowings as they mature  and the ability to fund new and existing loan commitments and also to take advantage of business opportunities as they arise 
liquidity is composed of the maintenance of a strong base of core deposits  maturing short term assets including cash and due from banks  the ability to sell or pledge marketable assets and access to lines of credit and the capital markets 
liquidity at the company is measured and monitored daily  thereby allowing management to better understand and react to emerging balance sheet trends  including temporary mismatches with regard to sources and uses of funds 
after assessing actual and projected cash flow needs  management seeks to obtain funding at the most economical cost to the company 
these funds can be obtained by converting liquid assets to cash or by attracting new deposits or other sources of funding 
many factors affect the company s ability to meet its liquidity needs  including variations in the markets served  loan demand  its asset liability mix  its reputation and credit standing in its markets and general economic conditions 
borrowings and the scheduled amortization of investment securities and loans are more predictable funding sources for the company  while deposit flows and securities prepayments are somewhat less predictable in nature  as they are often subject to external factors beyond the control of management 
among these are changes in the local and national economies  competition from other financial institutions and changes in market interest rates 
the funds management committee and the asset liability management committee alco are jointly responsible for oversight of the company s liquidity position and management of its asset liability structure 
the alco establishes specific policies and operating procedures governing the company s liquidity levels and develops plans to address future and current liquidity needs 
this committee monitors the loan and investment portfolios while also examining the maturity structure and volatility characteristics of the company s liabilities to develop an optimum asset liability mix 
funding sources available to the company include retail  commercial and municipal deposits  purchased liabilities and stockholders equity 
if needed for short term liquidity purposes  the company has access to million in unsecured lines of credit extended by correspondent banks 
in addition  the company can utilize its secured line of credit with the federal home loan bank of new york to access up to million in market rate funds with maturities of up to thirty years 
pursuant to authorization limits set by the board of directors  management of the company may  with prior regulatory approval  also access the brokered deposit market for funding 
as of year end  million in such funds  maturing in  were utilized by the company 
as of year end  brokered deposits totaling million were utilized as a source of funds by the company 

table of contents asset liquidity is provided by short term investments and the marketability of securities available for sale 
at december   the company had million in such liquid assets 
the company s loan portfolio and investment securities held to maturity are of high quality and mixed maturity  providing an excellent source of internal liquidity through maturities and periodic repayments of principal 
at year end  approximately million of these assets  including mortgage backed securities  were due to mature or be repaid within one year 
cash flows provided by the loan and investment portfolios are typically utilized to reduce the company s borrowed funds position and or to fund loan and investment securities growth 
the company s operating  investing and financing activities are conducted within the overall constraints of the company s liquidity management policy 
in february  the bank purchased million in bank owned life insurance 
the bank is the beneficiary of this policy that insures the lives of certain officers of the bank and its subsidiaries 
distributions are made to the bank only upon the death of an insured officer in accordance with the underlying policy 
accordingly  the boli held by the bank does not generate regular cash flows for reinvestment 
while past performance does not guarantee future results  management believes that the company s funding sources  including dividends from the bank  and the bank s funding sources will be adequate to meet future liquidity requirements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk asset liability management and market risk the process by which financial institutions manage interest earning assets and funding sources under different interest rate environments is called asset liability management 
the primary goal of asset liability management is to increase net interest income within an acceptable range of overall risk tolerance 
management must ensure that liquidity  capital  interest rate and market risk are prudently managed 
asset liability and interest rate risk management are governed by policies reviewed and approved annually by the company s board of directors 
the board has delegated responsibility for asset liability and interest rate risk management to the alco 
the alco meets quarterly and sets strategic directives that guide the day to day asset liability management activities of the company as well as reviewing and approving all major funding  capital and market risk management programs 
the alco  in conjunction with a noted industry consultant  also focuses on current market conditions  balance sheet management strategies  deposit and loan pricing issues and interest rate risk measurement and mitigation 
interest rate risk interest rate risk is the potential adverse change to earnings or capital arising from movements in interest rates 
this risk can be quantified by measuring the change in net interest margin relative to changes in market rates 
reviewing repricing characteristics of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities identifies risk 
the company s funds management committee sets forth policy guidelines that limit the level of interest rate risk within specified tolerance ranges 
management must determine the appropriate level of risk  under policy guidelines  which will enable the company to achieve its performance objectives within the confines imposed by its business objectives and the external environment within which it operates 
interest rate risk arises from repricing risk  basis risk  yield curve risk and options risk  and is measured using financial modeling techniques including interest rate ramp and shock simulations to measure the impact of changes in interest rates on earnings for periods of up to two years 
these simulations are used to determine whether corrective action may be warranted or required in order to adjust the overall interest rate risk profile of the company 
asset and liability management strategies may also involve the use of instruments such as interest rate swaps to hedge interest rate risk 
management performs simulation analysis to assess the company s asset liability position on a dynamic repricing basis using software developed by a well known industry vendor 
simulation modeling applies alternative interest rate scenarios to the company s balance sheet to estimate the related impact on net interest income 
the use of simulation modeling assists management in its continuing efforts to achieve earnings stability in a variety of interest rate environments 

table of contents the company s asset liability and interest rate risk management policy limits interest rate risk exposure to and of the base case net income for net earnings at risk at the month and month time horizons  respectively 
net earnings at risk is the potential adverse change in net income arising from up to basis point change in interest rates ramped over a month period  and measured over a month time horizon 
the company s december  balance sheet is held flat over the month time horizon with all principal cash flows assumed to be reinvested in similar products and term points at the simulated market interest rates 
change in net interest income month interest rate ramps basis points december  december  time horizon down down base flat up up down down base flat up up year one year two management also monitors equity value at risk as a percentage of market value of portfolio equity mvpe 
the company s mvpe is the difference between the market value of its interest sensitive assets and the market value of its interest sensitive liabilities 
mvpe at risk is the potential adverse change in the present value market value of total equity arising from an immediate hypothetical shock in interest rates 
management uses scenario analysis on a static basis to assess its equity value at risk by modeling mvpe under various interest rate shock scenarios 
when modeling mvpe at risk  management recognizes the high degree of subjectivity when projecting long term cash flows and reinvestment rates  and therefore uses mvpe at risk as a relative indicator of interest rate risk 
accordingly  the company does not set policy limits over mvpe at risk 
mvpe variability immediate interest rate shocks basis points december  december  down down base flat up up down down base flat up up change in mvpe mvpe ratio assumes marginal tax rate 
simulation and scenario techniques in asset liability modeling are influenced by a number of estimates and assumptions with regard to embedded options  prepayment behaviors  pricing strategies and cash flows 
such assumptions and estimates are inherently uncertain and  as a consequence  simulation and scenario output will neither precisely estimate the level of  or the changes in  net interest income and mvpe  respectively
