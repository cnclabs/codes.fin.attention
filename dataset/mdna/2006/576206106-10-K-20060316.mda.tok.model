item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a  under the headings critical accounting estimates and assumptions  certain trends and uncertainties and elsewhere in md a 
massey is impacted by the competitiveness of the markets in which it competes and market demand for coal 
massey competes with coal producers in various regions of the us and overseas for domestic and international sales 
continued domestic demand for massey s coal and the prices that it will be able to obtain primarily will depend upon coal consumption patterns of the domestic electric utility industry and the domestic steel industry 
consumption by the domestic utility industry is affected by the demand for electricity  environmental and other governmental regulations  technological developments and the price of competing coal and alternative fuel supplies including nuclear  natural gas  oil and renewable energy sources  including hydroelectric power 
consumption by the domestic steel industry is primarily affected by economic growth and the demand for steel used in construction as well as appliances and automobiles 
in recent years  the competitive environment for coal has been impacted by sustained growth in a number of the largest markets in the world  including the us  china  japan and india  where demand for both electricity and steel have supported high pricing for steam and metallurgical coal 
the cost of ocean transportation and the valuation of the us dollar in relation to foreign currencies significantly impact the relative attractiveness of massey s coal as it competes on price with other foreign coal producing sources 
see item  business  under the heading competition  for further discussion 
demand for massey s coal depends on its price and quality and the cost of transporting its coal to its customers 
coal prices are influenced by a number of factors and may vary dramatically by region 
the two principal components of the price of coal are the price of coal at the mine  which is influenced by mine operating costs and coal quality  and the cost of transporting coal from the mine to the point of use 
the cost of mining the coal is influenced by geologic characteristics such as seam thickness  overburden ratios and depth of underground reserves 
underground mining is generally more expensive than surface mining as a result of higher costs for labor including reserves for future costs associated with labor benefits and health care and capital costs including costs for mining equipment and construction of extensive ventilation systems 
the company presently operates active underground mines  including longwall mines  and active surface mines  with highwall miners 
see item  business  under the headings mining methods  mining operations and competition for further discussion 
increases in transportation costs could make coal a less competitive source of energy 
such increases could have a material impact on massey s ability to compete with other energy sources and on its cash flows  results of operations or financial condition 
on the other hand  significant decreases in transportation costs could result in increased competition from coal producers in other parts of the country 
see item  business  under the heading competition  for further discussion 
a significant decline in coal prices in general could adversely affect massey s operating results and cash flows 
massey s results are highly dependent upon the prices the company receives for its coal 
decreased demand for coal  both domestically and internationally  could cause spot prices and the prices the company is able to negotiate on long term contracts to decline 
the lower prices could negatively affect the company s cash flows  results of operations or financial condition  if the company is unable to increase productivity and or decrease costs in order to maintain the company s margins 
massey depends on continued demand from its customers 
reduced demand from or the loss of massey s largest customers could have an adverse impact on massey s ability to achieve its projected revenue 
decreases in demand may result from  among other things  a reduction in consumption by the electric generation industry and or the steel industry  the availability of other sources of fuel at cheaper costs and a general slow down in the economy 
when massey s contracts with its customers reach expiration  there can be no assurance that the customers either will extend or enter into new long term contracts or  in the absence of long term contracts  that they will continue to purchase the same amount of coal as they have in the past or on terms  including pricing terms  as favorable as under existing arrangements 
in the event that a large customer account is lost or a long term contract is not renewed  profits could suffer if alternative buyers are not willing to purchase the company s coal on comparable terms 
see item  business  under the heading customers and coal contracts for further discussion 

table of contents the level of massey s indebtedness could adversely affect its ability to grow and compete and prevent it from fulfilling its obligations under its contracts and agreements 
at december   massey had  million of total indebtedness outstanding  which represented of its total book capitalization 
the company has significant debt  lease and royalty obligations 
the company s ability to satisfy debt service  lease and royalty obligations and to effect any refinancing of its indebtedness will depend upon future operating performance  which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions in the markets that the company serves as well as financial  business and other factors  many of which are beyond the company s control 
the company may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations and future borrowings  or other financings may be unavailable in an amount sufficient to enable it to fund its debt service  lease and royalty payment obligations or its other liquidity needs 
the company s relative amount of debt could have material consequences to its business  including  but not limited to i making it more difficult to satisfy debt covenants and debt service  lease payments and other obligations  ii making it more difficult to pay quarterly dividends as the company has in the past  iii increasing the company s vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  iv limiting the company s ability to obtain additional financing to fund future acquisitions  working capital  capital expenditures or other general corporate requirements  v reducing the availability of cash flows from operations to fund acquisitions  working capital  capital expenditures or other general corporate purposes  vi limiting the company s flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in the company s business and the industry in which the company competes  or vii placing the company at a competitive disadvantage with competitors with relatively lower amounts of debt 
the covenants in massey s credit facility and the indentures governing its debt instruments impose restrictions that may limit massey s operating and financial flexibility 
massey s asset based loan credit facility and the indentures governing its notes contain a number of significant restrictions and covenants that may limit the company s ability and its subsidiaries ability to  among other things i incur liens and debt or provide guarantees in respect of obligations of any other person  ii increase common stock dividends above specified levels  iii make loans and investments  iv prepay  redeem or repurchase debt  v engage in mergers  consolidations and asset dispositions  vi engage in affiliate transactions  vii create any lien or security interest in any real property or equipment  viii engage in sale and leaseback transactions  and ix restrict distributions from subsidiaries 
operating results below current levels or other adverse factors  including a significant increase in interest rates  could result in massey being unable to comply with certain debt covenants 
if massey violates these covenants and is unable to obtain waivers from its lenders  massey s debt under these agreements would be in default and could be accelerated by the lenders 
if the indebtedness is accelerated  massey may not be able to repay its debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it 
even if massey is able to obtain new financing  it may not be on commercially reasonable terms or on terms that are acceptable to massey 
if massey s debt is in default for any reason  its cash flows  results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  complying with these covenants may also cause massey to take actions that are not favorable to holders of the notes and may make it more difficult for massey to successfully execute its business strategy and compete against companies that are not subject to such restrictions 
massey depends on its ability to continue acquiring and developing economically recoverable coal reserves 
a key component to the future success of massey is its ability to continue acquiring coal reserves for development that have the geological characteristics that allow them to be economically mined 
replacement reserves may not be available or  if available  may not be capable of being mined at costs comparable to those characteristics of the depleting mines 
an inability to continue acquiring economically recoverable coal reserves could have a material impact on the company s cash flows  results of operations or financial condition 
massey faces numerous uncertainties in estimating its economically recoverable coal reserves  and inaccuracies in its estimates could result in lower than expected revenues  higher than expected costs and decreased profitability 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and values of economically recoverable coal reserves  including many factors beyond massey s control 
as a result  estimates of economically recoverable coal reserves are by their nature uncertain 
information about the company s reserves consists of estimates based on engineering  economic and geological data assembled and analyzed by the company 
some of the factors and assumptions that impact economically recoverable reserve estimates include i geological conditions  ii historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas  iii the effects of regulations and taxes by governmental agencies  iv future prices  and v future operating costs 

table of contents each of these factors may in fact vary considerably from the assumptions used in estimating reserves 
for these reasons  estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of coal attributable to a particular group of properties may vary substantially 
as a result  the company s estimates may not accurately reflect its actual reserves 
actual production  revenues and expenditures with respect to its reserves will likely vary from estimates  and these variances may be material 
if the coal industry experiences overcapacity in the future  the company s profitability could be impaired 
the current strong coal market and increased demand for coal have been attracting new investors to the coal industry  spurring the development of new mines  and resulting in added production capacity throughout the industry 
the company and several of its major competitors have announced plans for substantial increases in productive capacity over the next several years 
a continuation of  or a further increase in  the current price levels of coal could further encourage the development of expanded capacity by new or existing coal producers 
any resulting increases in capacity could reduce coal prices and therefore reduce the company s margins 
see item  business  under the heading competition  for further discussion 
transportation disruptions could impair massey s ability to sell coal 
massey is dependent on its transportation providers to provide access to markets 
disruption of transportation services because of weather related problems  strikes  lockouts or other events could temporarily impair massey s ability to supply coal to customers 
throughout  the company s ability to ship coal was negatively impacted by a reduction in available and timely rail service 
lack of sufficient resources to meet the rapid increase in demand  a greater demand for transportation to export terminals and rail line congestion all seem to have contributed to the disruption and slowdowns in rail service 
although the railroads have taken action to remedy these issues  including the purchase of new locomotives and railcars  and the hiring and training of additional crews  such actions may not be sufficient to cure the disruption and slowdowns in rail service 
certain of massey s subsidiaries and other coal and transportation companies have been named as defendants in lawsuits in west virginia 
the suits allege that the defendants illegally transported coal in overloaded trucks causing damage to state roads and interfering with the plaintiffs use and enjoyment of their properties and their right to use the public roads  and seek injunctive relief and damages 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this litigation 
severe weather may affect massey s ability to mine and deliver coal 
severe weather  including flooding and excessive ice or snowfall  when it occurs  can adversely affect massey s ability to produce  load and transport coal  which may negatively impact the company s cash flows  results of operations or financial condition 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this risk 
federal and state government regulations applicable to massey operations increase massey s costs and may make massey s coal less competitive than other coal producers 
massey incurs substantial costs and liabilities under increasingly strict federal  state and local environmental  health and safety and endangered species laws  including regulations and governmental enforcement policies 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative  civil and criminal penalties  the imposition of cleanup and site restoration costs and liens  the issuance of injunctions to limit or cease operations  the suspension or revocation of permits and other enforcement measures that could have the effect of limiting production from the company s operations 
the company may also incur costs and liabilities resulting from claims for damages to property or injury to persons arising from its operations 
see item  business  under the heading environmental  safety and health laws and regulations for further discussion 
new legislation and new regulations may be adopted which could materially adversely affect massey s mining operations  cost structure or its customers ability to use coal 
new legislation and new regulations may also require massey or its customers to change operations significantly or incur increased costs 
the epa has undertaken broad initiatives aimed at increasing compliance with emissions standards and to provide incentives to customers for decreasing emissions  often by switching to an alternative fuel source 

table of contents massey must obtain governmental permits and approvals for mining operations  which can be a costly and time consuming process and result in restrictions on its operations 
massey s operations are principally regulated under surface mining permits issued pursuant to the smcra and state counterpart laws 
such permits are issued for terms of five years with the right of successive renewal 
additionally  the clean water act requires permits for operations that fill waters of the united states 
valley fills and refuse impoundments are typically authorized under nationwide permits that are revised and renewed periodically by the us army corps of engineers 
additionally  certain surface mines and preparation plants have permits issued pursuant to the clean air act and state counterpart clean air laws allowing and controlling the discharge of air pollutants 
regulatory authorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing of permit issuance 
requirements imposed by these authorities may be costly and time consuming and may result in delays in the commencement or continuation of exploration or production operations 
see item  business  under the heading environmental  safety and health laws and regulations for further discussion 
union represented labor creates an increased risk of work stoppages and higher labor costs 
at december   of massey s total workforce was represented by the umwa 
six of massey s coal preparation plants and one of its smaller surface mines have a workforce that is represented by a union 
in fiscal  these six preparation plants handled approximately of massey s coal production 
there may be an increased risk of strikes and other related work actions  in addition to higher labor costs  associated with these operations 
massey has experienced some union organizing campaigns at some of its open shop facilities within the past five years 
if some or all of massey s current open shop operations were to become union represented  massey could be subject to additional risk of work stoppages and higher labor costs  which could adversely affect the stability of production and reduce the company s net income 
massey is subject to being adversely affected by a decline in the financial condition and creditworthiness of its customers 
in an effort to mitigate credit related risks in all customer classifications  massey maintains a credit policy  which requires scheduled reviews of customer creditworthiness and continuous monitoring of customer news events that might have an impact on their financial condition 
negative credit performance or events may trigger the application of tighter terms of sale  requirements for collateral or  ultimately  a suspension of credit privileges 
the creditworthiness of customers can limit who the company can do business with and at what price 
for example  massey has contracts to supply coal to energy trading and brokering companies who resell the coal to the ultimate users 
massey is subject to being adversely affected by any decline in the financial condition and creditworthiness of these energy trading and brokering companies 
in addition  as the largest supplier of metallurgical coal to the american steel industry  massey is subject to being adversely affected by any decline in the financial condition or production volume of american steel producers 
see item  business  under the heading customers and coal contracts for further discussion 
massey is subject to various legal proceedings  which may have a material effect on its business 
massey and its subsidiaries are parties to a number of legal proceedings incident to the company s normal business activities 
some of the allegations brought against the company are with merit  while others are not 
there is always the potential that an individual matter or the aggregation of many matters could have an adverse effect on the company s cash flows results of operations or financial position 
see item  legal proceedings and note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
massey has significant reclamation and mine closure obligations 
if the assumptions underlying the company s accruals are materially inaccurate  the company could be required to expend greater amounts than anticipated 
the smcra establishes operational  reclamation and closure standards for all aspects of surface mining as well as most aspects of deep mining 
estimates of the company s total reclamation and mine closing liabilities are based upon permit requirements and the company s engineering expertise related to these requirements 
the estimate of ultimate reclamation liability is reviewed periodically by the company s management and engineers 
the estimated liability can change significantly if actual costs vary from assumptions or if governmental regulations change significantly 
see item  business  under the heading environmental  safety and health laws and regulations for further discussion 

table of contents foreign currency fluctuations could adversely affect the competitiveness of massey s coal abroad 
massey relies on customers in other countries for a portion of its sales  with shipments to countries in north america  south america  europe  asia and africa 
massey competes in these international markets against coal produced in other countries 
coal is sold internationally in us dollars 
as a result  mining costs in competing producing countries may be reduced in us dollar terms based on currency exchange rates  providing an advantage to foreign coal producers 
currency fluctuations among countries purchasing and selling coal could adversely affect the competitiveness of massey s coal in international markets 
terrorist attacks and threats  escalation of military activity in response to such attacks or acts of war may negatively affect the company s cash flows  results of operations or financial condition 
the company s business is affected by general economic conditions  fluctuations in consumer confidence and spending  and market liquidity  which can decline as a result of numerous factors outside of its control  such as terrorist attacks and acts of war 
future terrorist attacks against us targets  rumors or threats of war  actual conflicts involving the us or its allies  or military or trade disruptions affecting the company s customers may materially adversely affect its operations 
as a result  there could be delays or losses in transportation and deliveries of coal to the company s customers  decreased sales of its coal and extension of time for payment of accounts receivable from its customers 
strategic targets such as energy related assets may be at greater risk of future terrorist attacks than other targets in the us in addition  such disruption may lead to significant increases in energy prices that could result in government imposed price controls 
it is possible that any  or a combination  of these occurrences could have a material impact on the company s cash flows  results of operations or financial condition 
coal mining is subject to inherent risks 
massey s operations are subject to certain events and conditions that could disrupt operations  including fires and explosions  accidental minewater discharges  natural disasters  equipment failures  maintenance problems and flooding 
massey maintains insurance policies that provide limited coverage for some  but not all  of these risks 
even where insurance coverage applies  there can be no assurance that these risks would be fully covered by massey s insurance policies

table of contents item properties operations of massey and its subsidiaries are conducted on both owned and leased properties totaling more than  acres in west virginia  kentucky  virginia  pennsylvania and tennessee 
in addition  certain owned or leased properties of massey and its subsidiaries are leased or subleased to third party tenants 
massey s current practice is to obtain a title review from a licensed attorney prior to purchasing or leasing property 
it generally has not obtained title insurance in connection with acquisitions of coal reserves 
in some cases  the seller or lessor warrants property title 
separate title confirmation sometimes is not required when leasing reserves where mining has occurred previously 
massey and its subsidiaries currently own or lease the equipment that is utilized in their mining operations

coal reserves massey estimates that  as of december   it had total recoverable reserves of approximately billion tons consisting of both proven and probable reserves 
reserves are defined by the sec industry guide as that part of a mineral deposit  which could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination 
recoverable reserves means coal that is economically recoverable using existing equipment and methods under federal and state laws currently in effect 
approximately billion tons of massey s reserves are classified as proven reserves 
proven measured reserves are defined by the sec industry guide as reserves for which a quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops  trenches  workings or drill holes  grade and or quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling and b the sites for inspection  sampling and measurement are spaced so closely and the geologic character is so well defined that size  shape  depth and mineral content of reserves are well established 
the remaining billion tons of massey s reserves are classified as probable reserves 
probable reserves are defined by the sec industry guide as reserves for which quantity and grade and or quality are computed from information similar to that used for proven measured reserves  but the sites for inspection  sampling  and measurement are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced 
the degree of assurance  although lower than that for proven measured reserves  is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation 
information about massey s reserves consists of estimates based on engineering  economic and geological data assembled and analyzed by its internal engineers  geologists and finance associates 
reserve estimates are updated annually using geologic data taken from drill holes  adjacent mine workings  outcrop prospect openings and other sources 
coal tonnages are categorized according to coal quality  seam thickness  mineability and location relative to existing mines and infrastructure 
in accordance with applicable industry standards  proven reserves are those for which reliable data points are spaced no more than  feet apart 
probable reserves are those for which reliable data points are spaced  feet to  feet apart 
further scrutiny is applied using geological criteria and other factors related to profitable extraction of the coal 
these criteria include seam height  roof and floor conditions  yield and marketability 
as with most coal producing companies in central appalachia  the majority of massey s coal reserves are controlled pursuant to leases from third party landowners 
these leases convey mining rights to the coal producer in exchange for a per ton or percentage of gross sales price royalty payment to the lessor 
however  approximately of massey s reserve holdings are owned and require no royalty or per ton payment to other parties 
royalty expense for coal reserves from the company s producing properties owned and leased was approximately of produced coal revenue for the year ended december

payments due by period in thousands total within year years years beyond years long term debt capital lease obligations operating lease obligations coal purchase obligations coal lease obligations other purchase obligations total obligations long term debt obligations reflect the future interest and principal payments of the company s fixed rate senior unsecured notes outstanding as of december  see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
capital lease obligations include the amount of imputed interest over the terms of the leases 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
coal purchase obligations represent commitments to purchase coal from external production sources under firm contracts as of december  coal lease obligations includes minimum royalties paid on leased coal rights 
certain coal leases do not have set expiration dates but extend until completion of mining of all merchantable and mineable coal reserves 
for purposes of this table  the company has generally assumed that minimum royalties on such leases will be paid for a period of years 
other purchase obligations primarily include capital expenditure commitments for surface mining and other equipment as well as purchases of materials and supplies 
the company has purchase agreements with vendors for most types of operating expenses 
however  the company s open purchase orders which are not recognized as a liability until the purchased items are received under these purchase agreements  combined with any other open purchase orders  are not material and are excluded from this table 
other purchase obligations also includes contractual commitments under transportation contracts 
since the actual tons to be shipped under these contracts are not set and will vary  the amount included in the table reflects the minimum payment obligations required by the contracts 

table of contents additionally  the company has liabilities relating to pension and other postretirement benefits  work related injuries and illnesses  and mine reclamation and closure 
as of december   payments related to these items are estimated to be payments due by years in thousands within year years years the company s determination of these noncurrent liabilities is calculated annually and is based on several assumptions  including then prevailing conditions  which may change from year to year 
in any year  if the company s assumptions are inaccurate  the company could be required to expend greater amounts than anticipated 
moreover  in particular for periods after  the company s estimates may change from the amounts included in the table  and may change significantly  if its assumptions change to reflect changing conditions 
these assumptions are discussed in the notes to consolidated financial statements and in critical accounting estimates and assumptions of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section 
off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business  the company is a party to certain off balance sheet arrangements including guarantees  operating leases  indemnifications  and financial instruments with off balance sheet risk  such as bank letters of credit and performance or surety bonds 
liabilities related to these arrangements are not reflected in the company s consolidated balance sheets  and  except for the operating leases  which are discussed in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements  the company does not expect any material impact on its cash flows  results of operations or financial condition to result from these off balance sheet arrangements 
the company uses surety bonds to secure reclamation  workers compensation  wage payments  and other miscellaneous obligations 
as of december   the company had million of outstanding surety bonds 
these bonds were in place to secure obligations as follows post mining reclamation bonds of million  workers compensation bonds of million  wage payment and collection bonds of million  and other miscellaneous obligation bonds of million 
generally  the availability and market terms of surety bonds continue to be challenging 
if the company is unable to meet certain financial tests  or to the extent that surety bonds otherwise become unavailable  the company would need to replace the surety bonds or seek to secure them with letters of credit  cash deposits  or other suitable forms of collateral 
as of december   the company had secured million of surety obligations with letters of credit 
from time to time the company uses bank letters of credit to secure its obligations for worker s compensation programs  various insurance contracts and other obligations 
at december   the company had million of letters of credit outstanding including the million noted above that secure surety obligations  of which million was collateralized by million of cash deposited in restricted  interest bearing accounts pledged to issuing banks and million was issued under the company s asset based lending arrangement 
no claims were outstanding against those letters of credit as of december  certain trends and uncertainties massey s inability to satisfy contractual obligations may adversely affect its profitability 
from time to time  massey has disputes with customers over the provisions of sales agreements relating to  among other things  coal pricing  quality  quantity  delays and force majeure declarations 
massey s inability to satisfy its contractual obligations could result in the company purchasing coal from third party sources to satisfy those obligations  the company negotiating settlements with customers  which may include price reductions  the reduction of commitments or the extension of the time for delivery  and customers terminating contracts or initiating claims against massey 
the company may not be able to resolve all of these disputes in a satisfactory manner  which could result in the payment of substantial damages or otherwise harm its relationships with customers 
federal and state government regulations applicable to massey operations increase massey s costs and may make massey s coal less competitive than other coal producers 
massey incurs substantial costs and liabilities under increasingly strict federal  state and local environmental  health and safety and endangered species laws  including regulations and governmental enforcement policies 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative  civil and criminal penalties  the imposition of cleanup and site restoration costs and liens  the issuance of injunctions to limit or cease operations  the suspension or 
table of contents revocation of permits and other enforcement measures that could have the effect of limiting production from the company s operations 
the company may also incur costs and liabilities resulting from claims for damages to property or injury to persons arising from its operations 
see item  business  under the headings environmental  safety and health laws and regulations and note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
new legislation and new regulations may be adopted which could materially adversely affect massey s mining operations  cost structure or its customers ability to use coal 
new legislation and new regulations may also require massey or its customers to change operations significantly or incur increased costs 
the epa has undertaken broad initiatives aimed at increasing compliance with emissions standards and to provide incentives to customers for decreasing emissions  often by switching to an alternative fuel source 
massey is subject to being adversely affected by the potential inability to renew or obtain surety bonds 
federal and state laws require bonds to secure the company s obligations to reclaim lands used for mining  to pay federal and state workers compensation  and to satisfy other miscellaneous obligations 
these bonds are typically renewable annually 
surety bond issuers and holders may not continue to renew the bonds or may demand additional collateral upon those renewals 
the company s failure to maintain  or inability to acquire  surety bonds that are required by state and federal law would have a material impact on the company 
that failure could result from a variety of factors including the following i lack of availability  higher expense or unfavorable market terms of new bonds  ii restrictions on availability of collateral for current and future third party surety bond issuers under the terms of the company s senior notes or revolving credit facilities  iii the inability of the company to meet certain financial tests with respect to a portion of the post mining reclamation bonds  and iv the exercise by third party surety bond issuers of their right to refuse to renew or issue new bonds 
high oil prices could lead to a phase out of irc section tax credits  reducing the company s earnings from a promissory note tied to section tax credits 
owners of facilities that produce synthetic fuels can qualify for tax credits under the provisions of irc section in and  the company sold most of its interest in a synfuel facility 
as part of the compensation for the sale  the company received a contingent promissory note that is paid on a cents per section credit dollar earned based on synfuel tonnage shipped through the payments to be received under the contingent promissory note may be reduced or eliminated if the price of oil remains above a certain threshold price set by the irs the threshold price 
once the threshold price is reached  the section credits will be phased out ratably over a per barrel range above the threshold price 
the threshold price for will be set by the irs in april and if oil prices remain in the current price range some phase out is possible 
if the value of the section credits is eliminated or significantly reduced  the owner of the synfuel facility may elect to idle the facility  suspending the earnings the company receives from the facility 
during the year ending december   the company recognized earnings of approximately million related to the sale of the synfuel facility and activities related to the synfuel facility 
should the price of oil exceed the threshold price  the earnings the company receives related to this synfuel facility will be reduced or eliminated and the company may incur a loss 
shortages of skilled labor in the central appalachian coal industry may pose a risk to massey in achieving high levels of productivity at competitive costs 
coal mining continues to be a labor intensive industry 
in recent years  the company experienced a shortage of experienced mine workers when the demand and prices for all specifications of coal mined by the company increased appreciably 
the company s productivity and cash costs have been negatively impacted by the hiring of these less experienced workers 
a continued lack of skilled miners could continue to have an adverse impact on massey s labor productivity and cost and its ability to expand production to meet the increased demand for coal and the company s sales commitments to its customers 
fluctuations in transportation costs could affect the demand for massey s coal 
transportation costs represent a significant portion of the delivered cost of coal and  as a result  the cost of delivery is a critical factor in a customer s purchasing decision 
increases in transportation costs could make coal a less competitive source of energy 
such increases could have a material impact on massey s ability to compete with other energy sources and on its cash flows  results of operations or financial condition 
on the other hand  significant decreases in transportation costs could result in increased competition from coal producers in other parts of the country 
for instance  coal mines in the western us could become an increasingly attractive source of coal to consumers in the eastern part of the country if the costs of transporting coal from the west were significantly reduced and rail capacity was increased 

table of contents inflationary pressures on supplies and labor may adversely affect massey s profit margins 
generally  inflation in the us has been relatively low in recent years 
however  over the course of the last two years  the company has been significantly impacted by price inflation in many of the components of its cost of goods sold  such as fuel  steel  copper and labor 
for instance  the prices of diesel fuel and copper increased approximately and  respectively  over the two year period ending december  if the prices for which massey sells its coal do not increase in step with rising costs  the company s profit margins will be reduced 
critical accounting estimates and assumptions the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts 
these estimates and assumptions are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements 
significant changes to the estimates and assumptions used in determining certain liabilities described below introduce substantial volatility to the company s costs 
the following critical accounting estimates and assumptions were used in the preparation of the financial statements defined benefit pension the estimated cost and benefits of the company s non contributory defined benefit pension plans are determined by independent actuaries  who  with the company s review and approval  use various actuarial assumptions  including discount rate  future rate of increase in compensation levels and expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets 
the discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which the applicable liabilities could be effectively settled as of the measurement date 
in estimating the discount rate  forecasted cash flows were discounted using each year s associated spot interest rate on high quality fixed income investments 
at december  and  the discount rate used to determine defined benefit pension liability was 
the rate of increase in compensation levels is determined based upon the company s long term plans for such increases 
the rate of increase in compensation levels used was for the years ended december  and the expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets is based on long term historical return information and future estimates of long term investment returns for the target asset allocation of investments that comprise plan assets 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets used to determine expense in each period was   and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
a decrease in the expected rate of return assumption increases the defined benefit pension expense 
coal workers pneumoconiosis the company is responsible under the federal coal mine health and safety act of  as amended  and various states statutes  for the payment of medical and disability benefits to eligible recipients resulting from occurrences of coal workers pneumoconiosis disease black lung 
an annual evaluation is prepared by the company s independent actuaries  who  after review and approval by the company  use various assumptions regarding disability incidence  medical costs trend  cost of living trend  mortality  death benefits  dependents and interest rates 
the company records expense related to this obligation using the service cost method 
at december  and december   the discount rate used to determine the black lung liability was 
included in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements is a medical cost trend and cost of living trend sensitivity analysis 
workers compensation the company s operations have workers compensation coverage through a combination of either self insurance  participation in a state run program  or commercial insurance 
the company accrues for the self insured liability by recognizing cost when it is probable that the liability has been incurred and the cost can be reasonably estimated 
to assist in the determination of this estimated liability the company utilizes the services of third party administrators who derive claim reserves from historical experience 
these third parties provide information to independent actuaries  who after review and consultation with the company with regards to actuarial assumptions  including discount rate  prepare an evaluation of the self insured liabilities 
at december  and december   the discount rate used to determine the self insured workers compensation liability obligation was and  respectively 
a decrease in the assumed discount rate increases the workers compensation self insured liability and related expense 
actual experience in settling these liabilities could differ from these estimates  which could increase the company s costs 
other postretirement benefits the company s sponsored health care plans provide retiree health benefits to eligible union and non union retirees who have met certain age and service requirements 
depending on year of retirement  benefits may be subject to annual deductibles  coinsurance requirements  lifetime limits  and retiree contributions 
these plans are not funded 
costs are paid 
table of contents by the company as incurred by participants 
the estimated cost and benefits of the company s retiree health care plans are determined by independent actuaries  who  after review and approval by the company  use various actuarial assumptions  including discount rate  expected trend in health care costs and per capita costs 
at december  and december   the discount rate used to determine the other postretirement benefit liability was 
at december  the company s assumptions of the company health care plans cost trend were projected at an annual rate of ranging down to by ranging down to by at december   and remaining level thereafter 
included in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements is a sensitivity analysis on the health care trend rate assumption 
reclamation and mine closure obligations the smcra establishes operational  reclamation and closure standards for all aspects of surface mining as well as most aspects of deep mining 
the company s total reclamation and mine closing liabilities are based upon permit requirements and its engineering estimates related to these requirements 
the company adopted sfas effective january  sfas requires that asset retirement obligations be recorded as a liability based on fair value  which is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows 
the estimate of ultimate reclamation liability and the expected period in which reclamation work will be performed is reviewed periodically by the company s management and engineers 
in estimating future cash flows  the company considered the estimated current cost of reclamation and applied inflation rates and a third party profit  as necessary 
the third party profit is an estimate of the approximate markup that would be charged by contractors for work performed on behalf of the company 
the discount rate applied is based on the rates of treasury bonds with maturities similar to the estimated future cash flow  adjusted for the company s credit standing 
the estimated liability can change significantly if actual costs vary from assumptions or if governmental regulations change significantly 
contingencies the company is the subject of  or a party to  various suits and pending or threatened litigation involving governmental agencies or private interests 
the company has accrued the probable and reasonably estimable costs for the resolution of these claims based upon management s best estimate of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
see item  legal proceedings and note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion on the company s contingencies 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance  the company takes into account various factors  including the expected level of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies 
if actual results differ from the assumptions made in the evaluation of the company s valuation allowance  the company records a change in valuation allowance through income tax expense in the period such determination is made 
the company has a reserve for taxes that may become payable as a result of audits in future periods with respect to previously filed tax returns included in deferred tax liabilities separate disclosure has not been made because the amount is not considered material 
it is the company s policy to establish reserves for taxes that may become payable in future years as a result of an examination by tax authorities 
the company establishes the reserves based upon management s assessment of exposure associated with permanent tax differences ie  tax depletion expense  etc  tax credits and interest expense applied to temporary difference adjustments 
the tax reserves are analyzed periodically and adjustments are made as events occur to warrant adjustment to the reserve 
the company is currently under audit from the irs for the fiscal years ended october  and december  it is expected that the irs audit will be completed in the company s federal income tax returns have been examined by the irs  or statutes of limitations have expired through october  
table of contents coal reserve values there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and values of economically recoverable coal reserves 
many of these uncertainties are beyond the company s control 
as a result  estimates of economically recoverable coal reserves are by their nature uncertain 
information about the company s reserves consists of estimates based on engineering  economic and geological data assembled and analyzed by its staff 
some of the factors and assumptions that impact economically recoverable reserve estimates include i geological conditions  ii historical production from similar areas with similar conditions  iii the assumed effects of regulations and taxes by governmental agencies  iv assumptions governing future prices  and v future operating costs 
each of these factors may in fact vary considerably from the assumptions used in estimating reserves 
for these reasons  estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of coal attributable to a particular group of properties  and classifications of these reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net cash flows  may vary substantially 
actual production  revenue and expenditures with respect to reserves will likely vary from estimates  and these variances may be material 
recent accounting pronouncements inventory costs in november  the financial accounting standard s board fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb  chapter sfas 
sfas amends the guidance in accounting research bulletin arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
paragraph of arb  chapter previously stated that under some circumstances  items such as idle facility expense  excess spoilage  double freight  and re handling costs may be so abnormal as to require treatment as current period charges 
sfas requires that those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal 
in addition  sfas requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions of sfas are effective for inventory cost incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  the company adopted sfas on january   and does not expect the statement to have a material impact on its financial statements 
exchanges of nonmonetary assets in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions sfas 
this statement is based on the principle that the exchanges of nonmonetary assets are measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
sfas eliminates the narrow exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
a nonmonetary exchange is considered to have commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
this guidance became effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  during the third quarter of  the company adopted sfas and recognized a gain of million pre tax resulting from the application of sfas in the exchange of coal reserves 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
share based payments on december   the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r which requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  be recognized in the income statement based on their grant date fair values for interim or annual periods beginning after june  pro forma disclosure of stock option expense will no longer be permitted 
the cost will be recognized over the requisite service period that an employee must provide to earn the award ie  usually the vesting period 
the company adopted sfas r on january  using the modified prospective method 
the company is still evaluating the impact of sfas r on its financial statements  however  stock based employee compensation expense is expected to be similar to disclosed pro forma amounts 
sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 

table of contents post production stripping costs at its march  meeting  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on eitf regarding the accounting for post production stripping costs 
the consensus reached was that stripping costs incurred during the production phase of a mine are variable production costs that should be included in the costs of the inventory produced extracted during the period that the stripping costs are incurred 
this consensus limits accounting for production related stripping costs as a component of inventory to merely those costs associated with extracted or saleable inventories 
therefore  stripping costs associated with in process ie  uncovered  but unextracted production shall not be recognized in inventory under this consensus  but shall be recorded as cost of produced coal revenue 
this represents a significant change from the company s current accounting for production related stripping costs  as the company has historically included production related stripping costs as a component of surface mining inventory and allocated the costs incurred over the estimated total reserves of the mine 
eitf is effective for the first reporting period beginning after december  the transition provisions of eitf issue allow for a cumulative adjustment approach where the cumulative effect adjustment is recorded directly to retained earnings in the year of adoption 
the company adopted eitf on january  stripping costs attributed to coal that has not been extracted  included in inventory as advance stripping costs  was approximately million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
applying the requirements of this new eitf as of december  would have likely required the write off of substantially all amounts deferred 
application of this provision may increase the volatility of the company s earnings 
since advance stripping costs are incurred prior to the extraction of coal  the stripping costs will be expensed immediately 
as a result  operating costs for a given reporting period may not match the corresponding revenues recognized as coal is transported to customers 
see notes and to notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
accounting changes and error corrections in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections sfas 
the standard is a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
 as a result of an effort by the fasb to improve the comparability of financial reporting by working with the international accounting standards board toward development of a single set of quality accounting standards 
this statement addresses accounting changes and error corrections  and requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principle  unless it is impracticable 
when impracticable  this statement requires sfas to be applied to the balances of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of the earliest period for which retrospective application is practicable and that a corresponding adjustment be made to the opening balance of retained earnings or other appropriate components of equity or net assets 
this statement is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
the company adopted sfas on january  item a 
quantitative and qualitative discussions about market risk massey s net interest expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of short term interest rates 
at december   the outstanding  million of long term debt was under fixed rate instruments 
upon the termination of the million interest rate swap agreement in december  massey s interest expense is no longer sensitive to changes in the general level of short term interest rates 
however  if it should become necessary to borrow under the asset based revolving credit facility  those borrowings would be made at a variable rate 
interest income is very sensitive to changes in short term interest rates 
assuming that cash and cash equivalents was fixed at the december  level of million  a hypothetical basis point decrease in money market interest rates would result in a decrease of approximately million in interest income 
the company manages its market price risk for coal through the use of long term coal supply agreements  which are contracts with a term of one year or more in duration  rather than through the use of derivative instruments 
the company estimates that the percentage of its sales pursuant to these long term contracts was for its fiscal year ended december  the company anticipates that in  the percentage of sales pursuant to long term contracts will be comparable with the percentage of sales for the prices for coal shipped under long term contracts may be below the current market price for similar types of coal at any given time 
as a consequence of the substantial volume of its sales that are subject to these long term agreements  the company has less coal available with which to capitalize on stronger coal prices if and when they arise 
in addition  because long term contracts typically allow the customer to elect volume flexibility  the company s ability to realize the higher prices that may be available in the spot market may be restricted when customers elect to purchase higher volumes under such contracts  or the company s exposure to market based pricing may be increased should customers elect to purchase fewer tons
