item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for further discussion on the company s initial public offering 
upon the completion of this initial public offering and a secondary public offering of additional company shares held by aip in november  the company was no longer controlled by aip 
the company designs  manufactures and markets draglines  electric mining shovels and rotary blasthole drills used for surface mining and provides the aftermarket replacement parts and service for these machines 
there are only two global manufacturers of a full line of this large excavation machinery and the company believes it has the largest installed base of this equipment in the world and the leading market share in draglines and large rotary blasthole drills 
the company s products are sold to customers throughout the world in every market where surface mining is conducted with modern methods 
surface mining is safer  has lower extraction costs and is growing faster than underground mining 
growth is driven by increased demand for surface mined commodities such as copper south america  oil sands canada and coal australia  south africa  canada  the western united states  and increasingly  china and india 
the company has established a leading position in these important surface mining regions 
the company believes that coal surface mining in china and india holds significant potential for long term growth 
the company sold a large dragline to a chinese mining company in and completed shipping the major components for this machine in late the erection of the dragline is in process and will be completed in the company sells both original equipment manufactured oem and aftermarket parts and service 
oem machine sales are closely correlated with the strength of commodity markets and maintain and augment the company s almost billion calculated by estimated replacement value installed base  which provides the foundation for aftermarket activities 
the company s aftermarket parts and service operations  which are more stable and more profitable than its oem sales  accounted for approximately of sales over the last ten years 
over that period and throughout commodities cycles  the company s aftermarket sales have sustained a compound annual growth rate of  increasing every year except for one year in which sales declined 
the company has a broad and established global presence with a network of sales and service offices located in all countries with major surface mining operations 
the company manufactures its oem machines and the majority of aftermarket parts at its facilities in south milwaukee  wisconsin and milwaukee  wisconsin 
the company has announced a multi phase expansion of its manufacturing facilities in south milwaukee  wisconsin  see item properties for further discussion of this expansion program 
the company concentrates on producing technologically advanced and productive machines that allow the company s customers to conduct cost efficient operations 
the company is the only surface mining manufacturer of alternating current ac drive draglines and electric mining shovels and offers advanced computer control systems which allow technicians at its headquarters to remotely monitor and adjust its machines all around the world via the internet 
industry overview the equipment the company manufactures and services is primarily used to mine copper  coal  oil sands and iron ore 
growth in demand for these commodities is a function of  among other things  economic activity  population increases and continuing improvements in standards of living in many areas of the world 
while the company s aftermarket parts and service sales have grown consistently  mine operators tend to purchase oem equipment when they anticipate sustained strength in the commodities markets 
prices for copper  coal  oil and iron ore have increased significantly as compared to prior years 
factors that could support sustained demand for these key commodities include continued economic growth in china  india and the developing world and renewed economic strength in industrialized countries 
commodities markets served the company s equipment is primarily used by large multinational companies engaged in surface mining for a variety of commodities 
surface mining equipment for copper  coal  oil sands and iron ore operations have accounted for the largest percentage of industry demand 
in recent years  copper and oil sands mining operations have accounted for an increasing share of the company s sales of oem machines and aftermarket parts and services  although recently activity relating to coal has been increasing 
copper 
copper is a basic material used in residential and commercial construction  electrical equipment  transportation  industrial machinery and durable consumer goods 
according to the copper development association  on average each western single family home contains approximately pounds of copper and each automobile contains approximately pounds of copper 
copper is predominantly surface mined 
demand for copper is being driven by accelerating economic growth in the developing world and continued consumption in the developed world 
developing world demand is compounded because developing markets do not have the advantage of large pools of recycled copper scrap  which historically has accounted for approximately half of united states copper consumption 
china s copper consumption continues to grow  rising by from january through october when compared to  with projections that usage will continue to rise by per year for the rest of this decade 
according to the international copper study group icsg  in  worldwide mine production of copper was billion pounds and is projected to increase to billion pounds in and billion pounds in in addition  total expansion of annual mine capacity from to is expected to be approximately billion pounds 
the projected expansions exclude additional production that could come from existing capacity at mines that are currently on care and maintenance or temporary cutback 
coal 
coal is the world s most abundant low cost energy source and is a critical element of energy policy 
there are two types of coal steam coal used to generate electricity and coking coal required to produce steel 
demand for coking coal has recently risen in tandem with the increased demand for steel 
the largest coal producers are china  the united states  india  australia  russia and south africa 
within the united states  environmental legislation and increases in the prices for natural gas have caused demand for low sulfur surface mined coal to increase 
there has been a shift in coal mining activity from high sulfur coal reserves in the midwestern states to low sulfur coal  which is primarily surface mined  in the powder river basin area in wyoming and in montana 
according to the energy information administration eia  a statistical agency of the united states department of energy  in every year since  levels of surface mining in the united states have exceeded levels of underground mining 
in the most recent year for which data is available  the eia has estimated that approximately two thirds of all coal was surface mined 
china and india  which together account for of the world s population  have fast growing economies and limited domestic energy sources other than coal 
in china  coal is primarily mined underground  but surface mining is growing and in an attempt to support china s growing economy  china is increasingly adopting modern surface mining methods and using western equipment to access its coal reserves 
according to the chinese government  china produced approximately billion short tons of coal in  a increase over china is expected to produce billion tons of coal in coal is predominately surface mined in india 
according to india s ministry of coal  india produced million short tons of coal in and  according to coal india limited  demand is expected to be million tons by oil sands 
a geological formation of oil sands exists in the athabasca region of northern alberta  canada 
oil sands are a viscous mixture of sand  bitumen  clay and water with the consistency of cold molasses 
the oil sands are believed to contain the equivalent of over billion barrels of oil  of which billion has already been established as commercially viable 
for reference  according to eia data  the oil reserves of saudi arabia contain approximately billion barrels 
according to canadian government sources  alberta s oil sands currently account for about one third of canada s petroleum production  and in  the alberta ministry of energy anticipates that about one half of canadian crude oil production and of north american production will come from the oil sands 
surface mining methods account for approximately of current production in the oil sands region 
in  the company acquired certain assets of an alberta based canadian company with extensive experience in the field repair and service of heavy machinery for the surface mining industry 
this acquisition enabled the company to establish a sales and service infrastructure and further strengthen its position in the oil sands area of western canada 
iron ore 
iron ore is the only source of primary iron used to make steel and is mined in more than countries 
substantially all iron ore is surface mined 
in recent years  the five largest producers  accounting for approximately of world production  have been china  brazil  australia  russia and india 
the market for iron ore is largely a function of the demand for steel 
steel is used to produce  among other things  automobiles and other motor vehicles  mass transit and rail transport equipment  structural components for building and infrastructure  including bridges  railroads and factories  and industrial parts 
according to the us geological survey  worldwide production of iron ore in was billion tons and is estimated to be billion tons in growth is driven by chinese industrialization as well as additional requirements for steel in the developed and developing world 
other minerals 
surface mining machines are also used to mine molybdenum  phosphate  bauxite  gold and diamonds 
oem products the company s line of oem machines includes draglines  electric mining shovels and rotary blasthole drills 
draglines 
draglines are primarily used in coal mining applications to remove overburden by dragging a large bucket through the overburden and carrying it away 
the company s draglines weigh from to  tons  and are typically described in terms of their bucket size  which can range from nine to cubic yards 
the company currently offers a full line of models ranging in price from million to over million per dragline 
draglines are the largest and most expensive type of surface mining equipment  but offer customers the lowest cost per ton of material moved 
the average life of a dragline is approximately years 
electric mining shovels 
mining shovels are primarily used to load copper  coal  oil sands  iron ore  other mineral bearing materials  overburden  or rock into trucks 
there are two basic types of mining shovels electric and hydraulic 
electric mining shovels are able to handle a larger load  allowing them to move greater volumes of rock and minerals  while hydraulic shovels are diesel powered  smaller and more maneuverable 
an electric mining shovel offers significantly lower cost per ton of mineral mined as compared to a hydraulic shovel 
electric mining shovels are characterized in terms of hoisting capability and dipper capacity 
the company offers a full line of electric mining shovels  with available hoisting capability of up to tons 
dipper capacities range from to cubic yards 
prices range from approximately million to million per shovel  with the selling price of the company s most popular shovels being in the upper part of this range 
the company s electric mining shovels have an average life of approximately years 
rotary blasthole drills 
many surface mines require breakage or blasting of rock  overburden or ore by explosives 
to accomplish this  it is necessary to bore out a pattern of holes into which the explosives are placed 
rotary blasthole drills are used to drill these holes and are usually described in terms of the diameter of the hole they bore 
the company offers a line of rotary blasthole drills ranging in hole diameter size from inches to inches and ranging in price from approximately million to million per drill  depending on machine size and other variable features 
the selling price of the company s most popular drills is in the upper part of this range 
the average life of a rotary blasthole drill is approximately years 
aftermarket parts and services the company has a comprehensive aftermarket business that supplies replacement and upgrade parts and services for the company s installed base of operating equipment 
over the life of a machine  customer purchases of aftermarket parts and services generally exceed the original purchase price of the machine 
the company s aftermarket offerings include engineered replacement parts  maintenance and repair labor  technical advice  refurbishment and relocation of machines  comprehensive structural and mechanical engineering  non destructive testing  repairs and rebuilds of machine components  product and component upgrades  turnkey erections  equipment operation and complete equipment management under comprehensive  long term maintenance and repair contracts 
the company also distributes less sophisticated components which are consumed in the normal course of operating these machines 
a substantial portion of the company s international repair and maintenance services are provided through its global network of wholly owned foreign subsidiaries and overseas offices operating in australia  brazil  canada  chile  china  england  india  peru and south africa 
the company also maintains a continuous physical presence at certain customers domestic and overseas mine sites in some of these countries  as well as in argentina  in connection with its maintenance and repair contract operations 
the company realizes higher margins on sales of aftermarket parts and services than on sales of oem machines 
moreover  because these machines tend to operate continuously in all market conditions with expected lives ranging from to years and have predictable parts and maintenance needs  the company s aftermarket business is inherently more stable and predictable than the market for oem machines  which is closely correlated with expectations of sustained strength in commodity markets 
large mining customers are increasingly outsourcing the skills involved in maintaining large and complex surface mining equipment 
the company offers comprehensive maintenance and repair contracts to address this trend 
under these contracts  the company provides all replacement parts  regular maintenance services and necessary repairs for the excavation equipment at a particular mine with an on site support team 
in addition  some of these contracts call for the company s personnel to operate the equipment being serviced 
maintenance and repair contracts are beneficial to the company s customers because they promote high levels of equipment reliability and performance  allowing the customer to concentrate on mining production 
maintenance and repair contracts typically have terms of three to five years with provisions for renewal and early termination 
new mines in areas such as argentina  australia  canada  chile and peru are the company s primary targets for maintenance and repair contracts because it is difficult and expensive for mining companies to establish the necessary infrastructure for ongoing maintenance and repair in remote regions of these countries 
the company s aftermarket parts and service sales have generally grown consistently over the past ten years 
for most of the company s customers  production continues even during periods of lower commodity prices  maintaining demand for aftermarket parts and services  although will fitter competition tends to intensify during periods of commodity price weakness 
the company has improved performance in key areas that motivate customers to purchase its aftermarket parts and services by reducing lead times  increasing on time delivery and implementing an information technology infrastructure to better serve and market to its customers 
the company believes its emphasis on quality and technology has further increased customer motivation to use more of its aftermarket parts and services 
the company believes that its continued focus on on time delivery  competitive lead times and enhanced information technology systems combined with its comprehensive offerings of quality aftermarket components and installation services and its development of key supplier alliances position it to compete effectively for most aftermarket opportunities 
in july  the company completed the acquisition of contel plus automation drive systems proprietary limited contel  a world class provider of electrical and machine upgrade systems with sales of approximately million in this acquisition has allowed the company to combine contel s machine upgrade experience with its oem machine knowledge to provide a full range of electrical upgrades and service for its oem machines 
the company continues to look for small acquisitions to help it enhance its aftermarket service business 
customers most of the company s customers are large multinational corporations with operations in each of the major surface mining markets 
in recent years  customers have reduced their operating costs by employing larger  more efficient machines such as those produced by the company and have become increasingly sophisticated in their use and understanding of technology 
the company s focus on incorporating advanced technology such as ac drives and advanced controls has increased customer adoption of the company s product offerings 
further  the company believes these developments have contributed to increased demand for its aftermarket parts and service since the company is well equipped to provide the more sophisticated parts  product technical knowledge and service required by customers who use more complex and efficient machines 
over the past five years  the company s customers have conducted their most significant operations in the united states  south america  south africa  australia  canada  china and india 
the company expects china and india to experience the most growth in surface mining in the future 
in the aggregate  customers spent million  million and million on the company s oem machines and million  million and million on aftermarket parts and services in  and  respectively 
these amounts are projected to increase in as oem machine sales increases are driven by customer expectations of sustained strength in the copper  coal  oil sands and iron ore markets  ongoing and rapid industrialization in china and other parts of the developing world  demand for minerals in the developed world and the rising cost of non coal energy sources 
customers purchases of oem products may lag behind such increases in commodity prices because of the time needed to acquire the appropriate mining permits and establish the relevant infrastructure 
aftermarket sales are expected to increase as customers continue the trend of utilizing the company parts and services in a broader range of applications on their installed base of equipment 
the company s customers use the company s aftermarket parts and services because the company s high quality  reliable and durable products and services are well suited to the long productive lives of its oem machines 
however  some surface mine operators may find it more economical to buy lower quality and less durable parts from will fitters for equipment that is near the end of its useful life 
the company s customers operate under a high fixed cost structure 
small savings on the initial purchase of oem machines are lost if they lead to less efficient machines and greater down time 
furthermore  their operations are often conducted in remote areas and the large capital investment and long lead time associated with the purchase and erection of a machine encourages customers to select reliable and efficient machines and to keep these machines in continuous operation for as long as possible 
as a result  customers are focused on quality as well as price and expect the company to offer comprehensive aftermarket parts and services to increase efficiency and reduce down time 
the company does not consider itself to be dependent upon any single customer  although on an annual basis a single customer may account for a meaningful percentage of sales  particularly new machine sales 
in  and  one customer  bhp billiton  accounted for approximately   and  respectively  of the company s sales 
the company s top five customers in each of  and collectively accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of the company s sales 
this trend reflects the consolidation of the mining industry 
information technology infrastructure in early  the company completed the worldwide installation of baan  the enterprise resource planning erp system that was initially installed for its united states operations in august the erp system allows the company to rapidly analyze information in real time on a regional  customer  product line and commodity basis 
through the erp system the company can monitor numerous functions  including engineering  distribution  inventory and finance 
the company can collect data regarding its customers buying patterns and pricing history and deliver this information in real time to its management to assist in their decision making 
the company s erp system also allows it to apply company wide performance metrics  which the company uses to evaluate and improve its operations 
the company believes it can utilize its information technology infrastructure to generate new sales  particularly aftermarket sales 
the company s system allows it to monitor its worldwide inventory  determine when the company or the company s suppliers can deliver parts and track on time delivery performance  which together enables the company to improve the accuracy of its quoted lead times  thereby increasing customer satisfaction and inventory turns 
the company is developing strategies to increase sales and more effectively compete on price  delivery and available inventory because it can identify success rates on quotations for specific parts and customers and can record and communicate determinations as to the reasons for lost sales 
the company can ensure consistency and optimize pricing by monitoring pricing trends of individual parts sold worldwide 
the company is able to use its system to examine data related to its installed base  categorized by commodities  customers  and specific machines  to discern trends and formulate strategies for adding incremental sales 
information on global vendor sourcing and cost will enable the company to identify and utilize lower cost sources of supply 
the company also offers advanced computer control systems to customers which monitor machine operating data  allow for operational analyses and optimization and monitor material moved to help prevent overloading 
this system is available on all new machines and can be added to over of the units in the company s installed base 
the control systems on the machines transmit this information to a remote base station located in a mine office 
this allows for real time worldwide access by the company s employees and customers to machine information for machine status tracking and fault resolution 
this significantly reduces delay in machine repairs and provides important information on the operation and performance of the machine  allowing technicians to upgrade software and troubleshoot and adjust machines without visiting mine sites 
marketing  distribution and sales oem machines and aftermarket parts and services are primarily sold directly by company personnel both in the united states and in foreign markets 
sales outside the united states are made through company offices located in australia  brazil  canada  chile  china  england  india  peru and south africa and  in some markets  by independent sales representatives 
typical payment terms for new equipment require a down payment  and require customers to make progress payments 
lead times for large oem machines generally vary from four to nine months  but can be two years or more for a dragline 
the company generally attempts to obtain committed raw materials pricing through arrangements with suppliers for periods of up to a year 
recently  the company has incurred raw materials surcharges  and has been able to include terms providing for recovery of these cost increases in contracts 
sales contracts for machines are predominantly at fixed prices  with escalation clauses in certain cases 
most sales of replacement parts call for prices in effect at the time of order 
foreign operations the company s largest foreign markets are australia  canada  chile  south africa  china  india and peru 
the company employs direct marketing strategies in these markets as well as developing markets such as indonesia  jordan  mauritania and turkey 
a substantial portion of the company s sales and operating earnings is attributable to operations located outside the united states 
over the past five years  approximately of the company s oem machine sales and aftermarket sales have been in international markets 
the company s foreign sales  consisting of exports from the united states and sales by consolidated foreign subsidiaries  totaled million in  million in and million in approximately million or of the company s backlog of firm orders at december  represented orders for export sales compared with million or at december  and million or at december  new machine sales in foreign markets are supported by the company s established network of foreign subsidiaries and overseas offices that directly market its products and provide ongoing services and replacement parts for equipment installed abroad 
the availability and convenience of the services provided through this worldwide network ensure the efficient operation of company equipment by its customers  promote high margin aftermarket sales of parts and services  and give the company a sustained local presence to promote new machine orders 
the company sells oem machines  including those sold directly to foreign customers  and most of its aftermarket parts in united states dollars  with limited aftermarket parts sales denominated in the local currencies of australia  canada  south africa  brazil and the united kingdom 
aftermarket services are paid for primarily in local currency  with a natural partial currency hedge through payment for local labor in local currency 
in the aggregate  approximately of the company s sales were priced in united states dollars 
the value  in united states dollars  of the company s investments in its foreign subsidiaries and of dividends paid to the company by those subsidiaries will be affected by changes in exchange rates 
the company does not normally enter into significant currency hedges  although it may enter into arrangements to hedge specific non united states dollar denominated contracts 
competition the company s only global competitor in electric mining shovels and draglines is the p h division of joy global inc  although for certain applications the company s electric mining shovels may also compete against hydraulic shovels made by other manufacturers 
in rotary blasthole drills  the company s primary competitors are the p h division of joy global inc and atlas copco ab  which recently acquired a drilling equipment business from ingersoll rand company limited 
in china and russia  the company also faces limited competition from regional and domestic equipment manufacturers  however  such competition is not material to the company s core markets 
methods of competition are diverse and include price  lead times  operating costs  machine productivity  design and performance  reliability  service  delivery and other commercial factors 
long standing relationships the company and its competitors have with customers and their decision makers can provide a strong incumbency advantage in retaining business and securing new orders 
for most owners of the company s machines  the company is the primary replacement source for highly engineered  integral components 
competition in replacement parts sales consists primarily of independent firms called will fitters that produce copies of the parts manufactured by the company and other original equipment manufacturers 
the company s principal oem competitor also participates in this business 
these copies are generally sold at lower prices for use on older machines  and are generally acknowledged to be of lower quality than parts produced by the manufacturer of the original equipment 
the company also faces significant competition from manufacturers and distributors in the sale of consumable replacement parts which the company does not manufacture  including wire rope  non specialized parts and electrical parts  as well as aftermarket services competition from these market participants and local machining and repair shops 
the company has a variety of programs to attract large volume customers for its replacement parts 
although will fitters engage in significant price competition in parts sales  the company possesses clear non price advantages over will fitters 
the company s engineering and manufacturing technology and marketing expertise exceed that of its will fit competitors  who in many cases are unable to duplicate the exact specifications of the company s parts 
moreover  the use of parts not manufactured by the company can void the warranty on a new company machine  which generally runs for one year  with certain components under warranty for longer periods 
raw materials and supplies the company purchases from outside suppliers raw materials  principally structural steel  castings and forgings required for its manufacturing operations  and other items  such as electrical equipment  that are incorporated directly into the end product 
the company s foreign subsidiaries purchase components and manufacturing services both from local suppliers and from the company 
certain additional components are sometimes purchased from suppliers  either to expedite delivery schedules in times of high demand or to reduce costs 
moreover  in countries where local content requirements exist  local subcontractors can occasionally be used to manufacture the required components 
the company obtains all of the ac electrical drive components for its products exclusively from siemens energy automation  inc siemens  a united states subsidiary of siemens ag 
the company s products incorporate electrical equipment  including ac drive systems and computer hardware and software  which the company believes provides its products with an efficiency advantage 
the company purchases these electrical systems  produced by siemens  under a contract that has been continuously renewed since in february  the company entered into a new ten year supply agreement with siemens 
the contract provides for siemens to supply the company with electrical systems for the company s manufactured machinery under specified pricing parameters with exclusivity provisions applying to both parties 
the contract also includes limited warranties on parts and services supplied by siemens 
additionally  the company and siemens have entered into particular contracts or arrangements with respect to the development of joint technology for application to specific projects 
the company is not dependent upon any other sole source supplier 
in recent years  demand for steel and consolidation in the steel industry have resulted in pronounced cost increases for steel 
the company generally attempts to obtain committed raw materials pricing  through arrangements with its suppliers  for up to a year 
also  in recent years  the company has incurred raw materials surcharges and has been able to include terms providing for recovery of these cost increases in contracts entered into since the company has done business with a majority of its principal vendors for more than two decades and believes that it benefits from good relations with these vendors 
through commercial arrangements  forward pricing and contractual cost pass throughs  management believes it has minimized exposure to price increases and surcharges for raw materials 
manufacturing the design  engineering and manufacturing of most of the company s machines and manufactured aftermarket parts is done at its  square foot south milwaukee  wisconsin complex 
the company has announced a multi phase expansion of its manufacturing facilities in south milwaukee  wisconsin  see item properties for further discussion of this expansion program 
the company uses large  heavy manufacturing equipment in the machining  welding and assembly of oem machines and manufactured aftermarket parts 
the company s oem machines typically consist of thousands of parts  many of which are specialized 
oem machines and the majority of aftermarket parts are customized based on customer requirements 
the size and weight of these oem machines dictate that the machines be shipped to the job site in sub assembled units where they are assembled for operation with the assistance of the company s technicians 
planning and on site coordination of machine assembly is a critical component of the company s service to its customers 
to reduce lead times and ensure that customer delivery requirements are met  the company maintains an inventory of sub assembled units and parts to meet forecasted customer demands 
as of december   the company had million of inventory 
backlog the backlog of firm orders was million at december  and million at december  approximately of the backlog at december  is expected to be shipped during patents  licenses and franchises the company has numerous united states and foreign patents  patent applications and patent licensing agreements 
the company does not consider its business to be materially dependent upon any patent  patent application  patent license agreement or group thereof 
research and development expenditures for design and development of new products and improvements of existing mining machinery products  including overhead  aggregated million in  million in and million in the increases in and were in part due to expenditures related to the continuing development of electrical and machine upgrade systems 
employees at december   the company employed approximately  persons  approximately of whom are located outside the united states 
approximately of the company s united states employees are unionized 
the company s non united states workforce is not unionized  with the exception of a portion of the staff of certain chilean operations 
the company considers its relationship with its unionized and non unionized workers to be good 
the five and one half year contract with the united steel workers of america representing hourly workers at the south milwaukee  wisconsin facility and the three year contract with the international brotherhood of teamsters  chauffeurs  warehousemen and helpers of america representing hourly workers at the memphis  tennessee facility expire in april and september  respectively
