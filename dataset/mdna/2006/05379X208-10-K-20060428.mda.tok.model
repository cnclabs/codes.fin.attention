overview we develop  market and support an integrated suite of vbusiness video enabled ebusiness applications  all powered by the avistarvos software 
from the desktop  we deliver tv quality interactive video calling  content creation and publishing  broadcast origination and distribution  video on demand  and integrated data sharing 
the avistar video and data collaboration applications are all managed by the avistarvos video operating system 
by integrating video tightly into the way they work  our customers can use our system to help reduce costs and improve productivity and communications within the enterprise and between enterprises  to enhance relationships with customers  suppliers and partners 
using avistarvos software and leveraging video  telephony and internet networking standards  avistar applications are designed to be scalable  reliable  cost effective  easy to use  and capable of evolving with communications networks as bandwidth increases and as new standards and protocols emerge 
we currently sell our system directly to enterprises in selected strategic vertical markets  and have focused initially on the financial services industry 
our objective is to establish our technology as the standard for networked video through direct sales  indirect channel sales partnerships and the licensing of our technology to others 
we operate on a week fiscal year ending december we operate in two segments 
avistar communications corporation engages in the design  development  manufacture  sale and marketing of networked video communications products and associated support services 
collaboration properties  inc  or cpi  our wholly owned subsidiary  engages in the prosecution  maintenance  support and licensing of the intellectual property that we have developed  some of which is used in our products 
since inception  we have recognized the innovative value of our research and development efforts  and have invested in securing protection for these innovations through domestic and foreign patent applications and issuance 
as of december   we hold us and foreign patents  which we look to license to others in the collaboration technology marketplace 
on september   cpi commenced a patent infringement lawsuit against polycom  inc on november   avistar  cpi and polycom  inc 
entered into a settlement and patent cross license agreement 
under the terms of the settlement and patent cross license agreement  avistar and cpi provided polycom  inc and its subsidiaries with specific and general releases of liability 
polycom  inc  on behalf of itself and its subsidiaries  provided avistar and cpi with specific and general releases of liability  and made a lump sum payment to avistar in the amount of million million net of expenses 
avistar and cpi granted polycom  inc a fully paid up license to avistar s patent portfolio  including subsequent patents that have a priority date within five years of the date of the agreements 
as described under income from settlement and patent licensing below  we expect to recognize the payment received from polycom  inc  net of expenses  to income from settlement and patent licensing ratably over a five year period starting november  change in accounting treatment in september  we received a comment letter from the sec relating to our form k  which included questions regarding our accounting for the november settlement and patent cross license agreement with polycom  inc polycom 
the settlement and patent cross license agreement resulted in a million one time payment by polycom to us  and a payment by avistar to our own litigation counsel of million in contingent legal fees 
our form k for the fiscal year ended december  and form q for the three  six and nine months ended march   june  and september   respectively  reported the one time payment by polycom as revenue  recognized ratably over a five year period  net of contingent legal fees 
as a result of the sec s inquiry as to whether the polycom transaction should be characterized as revenue and after discussions with the sec  we concluded that a reclassification of license revenues from revenue to a component of operating expenses and reflected as income from settlement and patent licensing was necessary for previously filed financial reports 
the reclassification of the proceeds and expenses from the polycom settlement and patent cross license agreement had no effect on reported net loss  loss per share  stockholders equity deficit or net cash flows from operating  investing or financing activities  but did have the effect of overstating revenues and operating expenses for previously issued interim and annual consolidated financial statements  as of and for the quarters and year to date periods ended december   march   june  and september  in addition  the balance sheet as of december  has been amended to reflect the gross effect of the million payment by polycom to us  and the payment of million of contingent legal fees by avistar  which was previously reported on a net basis as deferred revenue 
significant concentrations  revenue recognition  segment reporting footnotes and the unaudited interim results have been modified to reclassify the polycom proceeds from revenue to income from settlement and patent licensing  to be consistent with the presentation of the net proceeds from the polycom settlement and patent cross license agreement in the statement of operations 
the presentation within operations is supported by a determination that the polycom licensing transaction is central to the activities that constitute our ongoing major or central operations  but that the settlement may also contain a gain element related to the settlement  which is not considered revenue under the financial accounting standards board fasb concepts statement no 
 elements of financial statements 
we did not have sufficient historical evidence to support a reasonable determination of value for the purpose of segregating the transaction into revenue related to the patent licensing and an operating or non operating gain upon settlement of litigation  resulting in the determination that the entire transaction is more appropriately classified as income from settlement and patent licensing within operations  as opposed to revenue 
see note correction of an error of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition  income from settlement and patent licensing  valuation of accounts receivable  and valuation of inventories 
revenue recognition we derive product revenue principally from the sale and licensing of our video enabled networked communications system  consisting of a suite of avistar designed software and hardware products  including third party components 
we also derive revenue from fees for installation  maintenance  support  training services and software development 
in addition  we derive revenue and income from settlement and patent licensing from the licensing of our intellectual property portfolio 
product revenue as a percentage of total revenue was for  for and for we recognize product and services revenue in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition sop  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions sop 
we derive product revenue from the sale and licensing of a set of desktop endpoint products hardware and software and infrastructure products hardware and software that combine to form an avistar video enabled collaboration solution 
services revenue includes revenue from installation services  post contract customer support  training and software development 
the installation services that we offer to customers relate to the physical set up and configuration of desktop and infrastructure components of our solution 
the fair value of all product  installation services  post contract customer support and training offered to customers is determined based on the price charged when such products or services are sold separately 
arrangements that include multiple product and service elements may include software and hardware products  as well as installation services  post contract customer support and training 
pursuant to sop  when an arrangement includes multiple elements  we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred  iii the fee is fixed or determinable  and iv collectibility is probable 
we apply these criteria as discussed below persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 
we require a written contract  signed by both the customer and us  or a purchase order from those customers that have previously negotiated a standard end user license arrangement or volume purchase agreement with us prior to recognizing revenue on an arrangement 
delivery has occurred 
we deliver software and hardware to our customers physically 
our standard delivery terms are fob shipping point 
the fee is fixed or determinable 
our determination that an arrangement fee is fixed or determinable depends principally on the arrangement s payment terms 
our standard payment terms generally require the arrangement fee to be paid within days 
where these terms apply  we regard the fee as fixed or determinable  and we recognize revenue upon delivery assuming other revenue recognition criteria are met 
if the payment terms do not meet this standard  which we refer to as extended payment terms  we may not consider the fee to be fixed or determinable and would then recognize revenue when customer installments are due and payable 
collectibility is probable 
to recognize revenue  we must judge collectibility of the arrangement fees  which we do on a customer by customer basis pursuant to our credit review policy 
we typically sell to customers with whom we have a history of successful collection 
for new customers  we evaluate the customer s financial position and ability to pay 
if we determine that collectibility is not probable based upon our credit review process or the customer s payment history  we recognize revenue when cash is collected 
if there are any undelivered elements  we defer revenue for those elements  as long as vendor specific objective evidence vsoe exists for the undelivered elements 
additionally  when we provide installation services  the product and installation revenue is recognized upon completion of the installation process and receipt of customer confirmation  subject to the satisfaction of the revenue recognition criteria described above  as we believe that the fee associated with the delivered product elements does not meet the definition of collectibility if the installation services have not been completed 
customer confirmation is obtained and documented by means of a standard form indicating the installation services provided and the hardware and software components are installed 
when the customer or a third party provides installation services  the product revenue is recognized upon shipment  subject to satisfaction of the revenue recognition criteria described above 
payment for product is due upon shipment  subject to specific payment terms 
payment for installation and professional services are due upon providing the services  subject to specific payment terms 
reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred during installation and support services have not been significant to date 
these expenses are recognized as revenue in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
eitf  income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred 
the price charged for maintenance and or support is defined in the product contract  and is based on a fixed price for both hardware and software components as stipulated in the customer agreement 
customers have the option to renew the maintenance and or support services in subsequent periods at the same rate as paid in the initial year 
revenue from maintenance and support is recognized pro rata over the maintenance and or support term  which is typically one year in length 
payments for services made in advance of the provision of services are recorded as deferred revenue and customer deposits in the accompanying balance sheets 
training services are offered independently of the purchase of product 
the value of these training services is determined based on the price charged when such services are sold separately  and training revenue is recognized upon performance of the service 
we recognize service revenue from software development contracts in accordance with sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
revenue related to contracts for software development is recognized using the percentage of completion method  when all of the following conditions are met a contract exists with the customer at a fixed price  we have fulfilled all of its material contractual obligations to the customer for each deliverable of the contract  verification of completion of the deliverable has been received  and collection of the receivable is probable 
the amounts billed to customers in excess of revenues recognized to date are deferred and recorded as deferred revenue and customer deposits in the accompanying balance sheets 
assumptions used for recording revenue and earnings are adjusted in the period of change to reflect revisions in contract value and estimated costs to complete the contract 
any anticipated losses on contracts in progress are charged to earnings when identified 
we recognize revenue from the licensing of our intellectual property portfolio based on the terms of the royalty  partnership and cross licensing agreements involved 
to date  a significant portion of our revenue has resulted from sales to a limited number of customers 
for  we recorded revenue of approximately million  or of total revenue  from deutsche bank ag and their affiliates  and ubs warburg llc and their affiliates  each of whom accounted for greater than of our total revenue for for  we recorded revenue of approximately million  or of total revenue  from deutsche bank ag and their affiliates and ubs warburg llc and their affiliates  each of whom accounted for greater than of our total revenue for for  we recorded revenue of approximately million  or of total revenue from deutsche bank ag and their affiliates 
no other customers individually accounted for greater than of our total revenue for we anticipate that our revenue  and therefore  our operating results for any given period  will continue to depend to a significant extent on a limited number of customers 
as a result  the loss of or a reduction in sales to any one of these customers would have a significant adverse impact on our operations and financial performance 
international revenue  which consists of sales to customers with operations principally in western europe and asia  comprised of total revenue for  for and for income from settlement and patent licensing we recognize the proceeds from settlement and patent licensing agreements based on the terms involved 
when litigation has been filed prior to a settlement and patent licensing agreement  and insufficient historical evidence exists of fair value of the patents licensed to support the segregation of the proceeds between a gain on litigation settlement and patent license revenues  we report all proceeds in income from settlement and patent licensing within operating costs and expenses 
when litigation has been filed prior to a settlement and patent licensing agreement  and sufficient historical evidence exists of fair value of the patents licensed to support the segregation of the proceeds between a gain on litigation settlement and patent license revenues  we report as license revenue  consistent with fasb concepts statement no 
 elements of financial statements 
the gain portion of the proceeds  when sufficient historical evidence exists to segregate the proceeds  is reported in other income according to sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
valuation of accounts receivable estimates are used in determining our allowance for doubtful accounts and are based on our historical collection experience  historical write offs  current trends  and the credit quality of our customer base and the characteristics of our accounts receivable by aging category 
if the allowance for doubtful accounts were to be understated  our operating income could be significantly reduced 
the impact of any such change or deviation may be increased by our reliance on a relatively small number of customers for a large portion of our total revenue 
as of december   three customers represented  and of our accounts receivable balance 
as of december   approximately of our accounts receivable balance was concentrated with one customer 
as of december   approximately of our accounts receivable were concentrated with one customer 
valuation of inventories we record a provision for obsolete or excess inventory for systems and components that are no longer manufactured or are at risk of being replaced with new versions of our product 
in determining the allowance for obsolete or excess inventory  we look at our forecasted demand versus quantities on hand and commitments 
any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and commitments and our reported results 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected  additional inventory write downs  provision for purchase commitments and charges against earnings may be required  which would negatively affect our operating results for such period

services  maintenance and support revenue increased by  to million in from million in  due primarily to new services provided within our existing customer base 
in  two customers accounted for of our revenue 
the level of sales to any customer may vary from quarter to quarter and year to year 
we anticipate that our revenue will continue to depend on a limited number of major customers for the foreseeable future  although the companies considered to be major customers and the percentage of revenue represented by each major customer may vary from period to period 
the loss of any one of those customers would have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results 
total revenue decreased by in to million from million for the decrease in total revenue in relative to was due to reduced software development revenue  offset by increased product revenue 
the reduction in software development revenue was a result of software development contracts completed in the increase in product sales was primarily due to new customers added in for  two customers accounted for of our total revenue 
for  one customer accounted for of our total revenue 
cost of revenue total cost of revenue increased by in to million from million for the increase in total cost of revenue in relative to was attributable to increased personnel utilized to support our maintenance and services offerings and a shift among our existing customer base from the purchase of software offerings with no costs of revenue to more hardware focused offerings with significant costs of revenue 
we expect the product mixture of future revenues to vary between hardware  software and services 
cost of revenue declined slightly by in to million from million for the decrease in cost of revenue in relative to was primarily due to the reduction in software development contract costs associated with the decrease in software development contracts

provision for income taxes decreased to  in  from  in due to no us taxes being due as a result of taxable losses in provision for income taxes increased significantly in to  from  for the increase in provision for income taxes in relative to was due primarily to federal  state and foreign income taxes due as a result of the difference in taxable income versus reported income caused by the settlement and cross license patent agreement with polycom  inc signed on november   where we granted to polycom a non exclusive  fully paid up  license to our patent portfolio 
the net million license fee paid to us by polycom was deferred for financial reporting purposes and will be recognized as income from settlement and patent licensing ratably over the five year period beginning november  for tax reporting purposes  the million license fee was accounted for as taxable income in  thus generating a federal and state tax liability  net of utilization of our net operating losses and tax credits

the cash outflows associated with the net loss  along with the slight decrease in inventories and prepaid expenses reflect the smaller scale of our business in relative to the increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and other reflect the timing of disbursements relative to expenditures for property and equipment for were approximately  at december   we did not have any material commitments for future capital expenditures 
we anticipate spending approximately million in capital expenditures during the next months 
the following table summarizes our known contractual obligations and commitments as of december  in thousands for the periods presented 
payments due by period total less than year years years more than years contractual obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total on february   we entered into a loan and security agreement with a financial institution to borrow up to million under a revolving line of credit 
on december   we entered into an amendment to the loan and security agreement to increase the maximum funds available under the line of credit to million and extend the term of the agreement 
the amended loan and security agreement  as further amended in march  had an expiration date of february  the agreement  as amended  included a first priority security interest in all our assets  excluding intellectual property 
gerald burnett  our chairman and chief executive officer  had provided a collateralized guarantee to the financial institution  assuring payment of our obligations under the agreement and as a consequence  a number of restrictive covenants from the original loan and security agreement were deleted  except for quick ratio and loan to value covenants  allowing us greater access to the full amount of the facility 
on february   the loan and security agreement was amended to change the maximum borrowings to million  subject to certain quick ratio and loan to value covenants  and to extend the term of the loan and security agreement to february  in connection with this amendment  dr 
burnett s collateralized guarantee was amended to reduce the amount of such guarantee to million 
in addition to the guarantee provided to the financial institution  dr 
burnett has also provided a personal guarantee to avistar assuring the provision of up to million to avistar in the event that at least million is not available to us under the line of credit  or an alternate financing arrangement  for any reason 
during  we borrowed  under the loan and security agreement 
these outstanding borrowings were repaid in november using a portion of the proceeds from the settlement and patent cross license agreement with polycom  inc there were no outstanding borrowings under the line of credit as of december  the loan and security agreement expired by its terms on february   as which time the collateralized guarantee of dr 
burnett also expired 
on october   we completed the private sale of  shares of our common stock to dr 
burnett and other members of his family at a price per share of 
the net proceeds of this private financing  after deducting expenses of the financing  were approximately million 
under the terms of the private placement  dr 
burnett agreed to certain restrictions on  of the  shares purchased by him 
these restrictions require dr 
burnett to vote such shares in the same proportion as our outstanding common stock not beneficially owned by dr 
burnett 
on march   we completed the private sale of a total of  shares of our common stock to fuller thaler avalanche fund  lp and fuller thaler behavioral finance fund  ltd 
at a price per share of 
the net proceeds of this private financing after deducting expenses of the financing were approximately million 
the issuance of these additional shares reduced the number of dr 
burnett s shares subject to voting restrictions imposed in connection with his october  purchase of common stock from  to  shares 
as of december   all voting restrictions of dr 
burnett s shares had lapsed 
on november   we entered into settlement and patent cross license agreement with polycom  inc under this agreement  cpi agreed to dismiss  with prejudice  its infringement suit against polycom and both companies agreed to cross license each other s patent portfolios 
the original litigation was initiated in september  in the federal district court for the northern district of california and involved the following cpi patents us patent nos 
   and  the agreement resulted in a payment  net of legal fees  to us from polycom in the amount of million 
we currently believe that existing cash and cash equivalents balances will provide us with sufficient funds to finance our operations for the next months 
we intend to continue to invest in the development of new products and enhancements to our existing products 
our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including without limitation  general economic conditions and conditions in the financial services industry in particular  the level and timing of product  services and licensing revenue  the costs and timing of our product development efforts and the success of these development efforts  the costs and timing of our sales and marketing activities  the extent to which our existing and new products gain market acceptance  competing technological and market developments  the costs and proceeds involved in maintaining and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  all of which may impact our ability to achieve and maintain profitability

sfas no

to recognize actual forfeitures when they occurred rather than estimate them at the grant date make a one time cumulative adjustment at the adoption date for estimated forfeitures  regardless of the transition method 
avistar will apply the black scholes merton model to estimate the fair value of share based payments to employees  which will then be amortized on a ratable basis over the requisite service period
