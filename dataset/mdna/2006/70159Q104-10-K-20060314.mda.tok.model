item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
overview parkway is a self administered and self managed reit specializing in the acquisition  operations and leasing of office properties 
the company is geographically focused on the southeastern and southwestern united states and chicago 
as of january  parkway owned or had an interest in office properties located in states with an aggregate of approximately million square feet of leasable space 
the company generates revenue primarily by leasing office space to its customers and providing management and leasing services to third party office property owners including joint venture interests 
the primary drivers behind parkway s revenues are occupancy  rental rates and customer retention 
occupancy 
parkway s revenues are dependent on the occupancy of its office buildings 
as a result of job losses and over supply of office properties during through  vacancy rates increased nationally and in parkway s markets 
in  the office sector began to recover from high vacancy rates due to improving job creation 
as of february   occupancy of parkway s office portfolio was compared to as of october  and as of january  not included in the february  occupancy rate are signed leases totaling  square feet  which commence during the first through third quarters of and will raise parkway s percentage leased to 
to combat rising vacancy  parkway utilizes innovative approaches to produce new leases 
these include the broker bill of rights  a short form service agreement and customer advocacy programs which are models in the industry and have helped the company maintain occupancy around during a time when the national occupancy rate is approximately 
parkway projects occupancy ranging from to during for its office properties 
rental rates 
an increase in vacancy rates has the effect of reducing market rental rates and vice versa 
parkway s leases typically have three to seven year terms 
as leases expire  the company replaces the existing leases with new leases at the current market rental rate  which today is often lower than the existing lease rate 
customer retention is increasingly important in controlling costs and preserving revenue 
customer retention 
keeping existing customers is important as high customer retention leads to increased occupancy  less downtime between leases  and reduced leasing costs 
parkway estimates that it costs five to six times more to replace an existing customer with a new one than to retain the customer 
in making this estimate  parkway takes into account the sum of revenue lost during downtime on the space plus leasing costs  which rise as market vacancies increase 
therefore  parkway focuses a great deal of energy on customer retention 
parkway s operating philosophy is based on the premise that it is in the customer retention business 
parkway seeks to retain its customers by continually focusing on operations at its office properties 
the company believes in providing superior customer service  hiring  training  retaining and empowering each employee  and creating an environment of open communication both internally and externally with customers and stockholders 
over the past nine years  parkway maintained an average customer retention rate 
parkway s customer retention for the year ending december  was compared to for the year ending december  strategic planning 
for many years  parkway has been engaged in a process of strategic planning and goal setting 
the material goals and objectives of parkway s earlier strategic plans have been achieved  and benefited parkway s stockholders through increased funds from operations available to common shareholders ffo and dividend payments per share 
effective january   the company adopted a three year strategic plan referred to as value square  which was completed on december  this plan reflected the employees commitment to create value for parkway s shareholders while holding firm to the core values as espoused in the parkway commitment to excellence 
under the value square plan the company created value by venturing with best partners  asset recycling  leverage neutral growth  uncompromising focus on operations and provided an equity return to its shareholders that was greater than that of its peer group  the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit office index 
equity return was defined as growth in ffo per diluted share 
the highlights of  and reflect the strategy set forth in value square as described below venture with best partners 
during through  we sold joint venture interests in seven office properties 
parkway continues to evaluate its existing portfolio for joint venture candidates and anticipates joint venturing more properties  as well as purchasing new properties with the intention of joint venturing them 
during  parkway formed a discretionary fund with ohio pers and the discretionary fund purchased two office buildings totaling million 
page of asset recycling 
parkway sold one office property  while maintaining a year non cancelable management contract  and a 
acre parcel of land in and two office properties in using the proceeds from the joint ventures  property sales  stock offerings and bank lines of credit  parkway purchased office buildings totaling million during the three years of value square 
leverage neutral growth 
parkway began with a debt to total market capitalization of and operated most of the plan below  with an average of over the three year period 
uncompromising focus on operations 
recognizing that in this difficult real estate environment  operating efficiently and consistently is more important than ever  parkway implemented the uncompromising focus on operations ufo program in the first quarter of  whereby parkway s customer advocate grades each property in all areas of consistency and high standards 
this is done in conjunction with the customer advocate interviews with each customer each year 
parkway continues to focus on the basics of our business customer retention  leasing  and controlling operating expenses and capital expenditures  to maintain our occupancy  all of which have the effect of maintaining and increasing net operating income 
during the value square plan  parkway averaged customer retention of annually  however occupancy dropped from at the beginning of the plan to at the end 
the company s average occupancy during the three years was  which was above the national average over the same time frame 
equity returns to shareholders greater than the nareit office index 
parkway achieved the financial goal of the value square plan  which was ffo growth greater than the company s peer group 
in connection with the value square plan  restricted stock had been granted to officers of the company and would vest early if two performance targets were met 
parkway had to achieve ffo growth greater than the peer group and ffo growth had to be positive 
while parkway achieved ffo growth greater than  the company did not achieve positive ffo growth 
therefore  the restricted shares were not released and will continue to vest over the original seven year vesting period 
on january   the company initiated a new operating plan that will be referred to as the gear up plan 
at the heart of the gear up plan are great people transforming parkway through equity opportunities and asset recycling from an owner operator to an operator owner 
our long standing commitment to retain our customers and provide an uncompromising focus on operations remains steadfast 
we believe that by accomplishing these goals we can deliver excellent performance to our shareholders 
the gear up plan is more of an evolution from the value square plan rather than a revolutionary new plan as there are many similarities between the two plans 
the goals of the gear up plan are as follows great people 
great customer service starts with hiring great people  training them well and retaining them 
it will take great people to accomplish the ambitious goals of the plan 
equity opportunities 
over the last several years management has created a broad array of equity opportunities for parkway 
on the private equity side this includes the use of joint ventures and discretionary funds  such as the new fund with ohio pers 
the judicious use of private equity provides a greater return on equity to the public shareholders 
parkway intends to contribute assets from its balance sheet to form new joint ventures and expects these subsequent ventures to proximate discretionary funds in their duration and economics 
on the public equity side  this includes the judicious use of common equity and preferred equity to manage the balance sheet and growth 
asset recycling 
the company has demonstrated its willingness in the past to sell assets when management believed the time was right 
since the start of the gear up plan development over months ago  the investment market has continued to indicate that now is the time to pursue certain sales to maximize value  therefore asset recycling has risen in importance 
parkway has identified buildings in twelve markets which total almost million rentable square feet to be part of the asset recycling program during the gear up plan 
most of these properties are smaller assets or located in smaller markets that do not fit with the company strategy of owning larger assets in institutional markets 
the dispositions that are planned will help align the company s portfolio with its current acquisition criteria  which focuses on larger properties in institutional markets 
in most cases  parkway will keep a to joint venture interest in the properties being recycled and retain management and leasing agreements 
page of these two goals  equity opportunities and asset recycling  are what combine to transform parkway from being first an owner of real estate  and secondarily an operator of real estate for others to being first an operator of real estate for others that also owns an interest in the real estate 
the three years of the gear up plan are a springboard for this transformation 
the plan anticipates the sale  mainly through the joint venture format of almost million in assets  million of which relates to north michigan 
simultaneously  the plan includes fully investing the remaining million for the opers fund and making fee simple acquisitions of almost million 
management strongly believes that these actions will result in parkway better leveraging its core strength of operating office properties and will be advantageous for the company s shareholders over the long term 
the key to success in gear up will be in the areas of equity opportunities and asset recycling 
to prepare for the challenges of these goals  parkway hired a full time fund manager and a full time dispositions officer for the first time in corporate history and both of them are diligently working to achieve these goals 
retain customers 
customer retention remains the cornerstone of the company s business and is why partners are venturing with parkway 
the goal is a customer retention rate of to 
uncompromising focus on operations 
parkway is reaffirming its commitment to do that which it does best  and that is to operate office properties for maximum returns 
performance 
in the planning process  management first decided what actions to take strategically over the next three years and secondly  modeled the economic impact of these actions 
given the large component of asset recycling in the plan  management selected a financial metric that would be most appropriate to measure the success of the plan 
this led to the adoption of cumulative adjusted funds available for distribution cumulative adjusted fad as the metric for the gear up plan  with a target of per share cumulative over three years 
additionally  parkway has established a self imposed limit for the modified fixed charge coverage ratio of an average of times as a pledge not to use leverage to achieve company goals 
for the gear up plan parkway is not abandoning funds from operations  but rather carrying it a step further to include accountability for capital items and removing the accounting adjustments which are not directly influenced by the operations of its properties 
management believes an adjusted fad goal provides an effective alignment with the shareholders by focusing the team on maximizing income from operations while being mindful of capital expenses and ultimately the funds available to cover the dividend 
cumulative adjusted fad is calculated as the sum of adjusted fad for each of the three years of the plan 
the adjustments that will be made to fad reported each quarter principally include charges for impairment of value and expenses related to the early extinguishment of debt 
discretionary fund 
on july   parkway  through affiliated entities  entered into a limited partnership agreement forming a million discretionary fund with ohio pers for the purpose of acquiring high quality multi tenant office properties 
ohio pers is a investor and parkway is a investor in the fund  which will be capitalized with approximately million of equity capital and million of non recourse  fixed rate first mortgage debt

the joint venture partner will provide to of the joint venture capital  with parkway to provide the balance

the primary reason for the decrease is due to the net effect of the consolidation of north michigan effective january  and the transfer of an interest in maitland to a joint venture effective june  see detailed information regarding the joint venture transaction under the caption joint ventures appearing in item business 
the joint venture transaction is summarized in the following table in thousands

the company targets a debt to total market capitalization rate at a percentage in the mid s 
this rate may vary at times pending acquisitions  sales and or equity offerings 
in addition  volatility in the price of the company s common stock may affect the debt to total market capitalization ratio 
however  over time the company plans to maintain a percentage in the mid s 
in addition to this debt ratio  the company monitors interest  fixed charge and modified fixed charge coverage ratios 
the interest coverage ratio is computed by comparing the cash interest accrued to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda

ebitda  as calculated by us  is not comparable to ebitda reported by other reits that do not define ebitda exactly as we do 
ebitda does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  and should not be considered an alternative to operating income or net income as an indicator of performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as an indicator of liquidity

critical accounting estimates general 
parkway s investments are generally made in office properties 
therefore  the company is generally subject to risks incidental to the ownership of real estate 
some of these risks include changes in supply or demand for office properties or tenants for such properties in an area in which we have buildings  changes in real estate tax rates  and changes in federal income tax  real estate and zoning laws 
the company s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon its consolidated financial statements 
the company s consolidated financial statements include the accounts of parkway properties  inc  its majority owned subsidiaries and joint ventures in which the company has a controlling interest 
parkway also consolidates subsidiaries where the entity is a variable interest entity and parkway is the primary beneficiary  as defined in fasb interpretation r consolidation of variable interest entities fin r 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the reporting period 
actual results could differ from our estimates 
the accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are more fully described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
however  certain of the company s significant accounting policies are considered critical accounting policies due to the increased level of assumptions used or estimates made in determining their impact on our consolidated financial statements 
page of parkway considers critical accounting policies and estimates to be those used in the determination of the reported amounts and disclosure related to the following impairment or disposal of long lived assets  depreciable lives applied to real estate and improvements to real estate  initial recognition  measurement and allocation of the cost of real estate acquired  and allowance for doubtful accounts impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
changes in the supply or demand of tenants for our properties could impact our ability to fill available space 
should a significant amount of available space exist for an extended period  our investment in a particular office building may be impaired 
we evaluate our real estate assets upon the occurrence of significant adverse changes to assess whether any impairment indicators are present that affect the recovery of the carrying amount 
real estate assets are classified as held for sale or held and used in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the company records assets held for sale at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
with respect to assets classified as held and used  we periodically review these assets to determine whether our carrying amount will be recovered 
a long lived asset is considered impaired if its carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value 
fair value is based on the estimated and realizable contract sales price if available for the asset less estimated costs to sell 
if a sales price is not available  the estimated undiscounted cash flows of the asset for the remaining useful life are used to determine if the carrying value is recoverable 
the cash flow estimates are based on assumptions about employing the asset for its remaining useful life 
factors considered in projecting future cash flows include but are not limited to existing leases  future leasing and terminations  market rental rates  capital improvements  tenant improvements  leasing commissions  inflation and other known variables 
upon impairment  the company would recognize an impairment loss to reduce the carrying value of the long lived asset to our estimate of its fair value 
the estimate of fair value and cash flows to be generated from properties requires us to make assumptions 
if one or more assumptions prove incorrect or if the assumptions change  the recognition of an impairment loss on one or more properties may be necessary in the future  which would result in a decrease in net income 
during the second quarter of  parkway recorded an impairment loss of  on acres of land in new orleans  louisiana based on market research and comparable sales in the area 
however  during the quarter ending september   the city of new orleans sustained considerable damage as a result of hurricane katrina 
currently  the company is unable to assess the damage  if any  to the land or whether the value of the land is impaired 
therefore  no additional impairment loss has been recorded 
no impairment losses were recorded in depreciable lives applied to real estate and improvements to real estate 
depreciation of buildings and parking garages is computed using the straight line method over an estimated useful life of years 
depreciation of building improvements is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the improvement 
if our estimate of useful lives proves to be incorrect  the depreciation expense recognized would also be incorrect 
therefore  a change in the estimated useful lives assigned to buildings and improvements would result in either an increase or decrease in depreciation expense  which would result in an increase or decrease in earnings 
initial recognition  measurement and allocation of the cost of real estate acquired 
parkway accounts for its acquisitions of real estate in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations  which requires the fair value of the real estate acquired to be allocated to the acquired tangible assets  consisting of land  building  garage  building improvements and tenant improvements  identified intangible assets and liabilities  consisting of the value of above and below market leases  customer relationships  lease costs and the value of in place leases and any value attributable to above or below market debt assumed with the acquisition 
parkway allocates the purchase price of properties to tangible and intangible assets based on fair values 
the company determines the fair value of the tangible and intangible components using a variety of methods and assumptions all of which result in an approximation of fair value 
differing assumptions and methods could result in different estimates of fair value and thus  a different purchase price allocation and corresponding increase or decrease in depreciation and amortization expense 
page of allowance for doubtful accounts 
accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
our receivable balance is comprised primarily of rents and operating expense recoveries due from customers 
change in the supply of or demand for office properties could impact our customers ability to honor their lease obligations  which could in turn affect our recorded revenues and estimates of the collectibility of our receivables 
revenue from real estate rentals is recognized and accrued as earned on a pro rata basis over the term of the lease 
we regularly evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts considering such factors as credit quality of our customers  delinquency of payment  historical trends and current economic conditions 
we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts for customer balances that are over days past due and for specific customer receivables for which collection is considered doubtful 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  which could result in an increase or decrease in bad debt expense 
funds from operations management believes that funds from operations ffo is an appropriate measure of performance for equity reits and computes this measure in accordance with the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit definition of ffo 
ffo as reported by parkway may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition 
we believe ffo is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure that enhances the comparability of our operations by adjusting net income for items not reflective of our principal and recurring operations 
this measure  along with cash flows from operating  financing and investing activities  provides investors with an indication of our ability to incur and service debt  to make capital expenditures and to fund other cash needs 
in addition  ffo has widespread acceptance and use within the reit and analyst communities 
funds from operations is defined by nareit as net income computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of property and extraordinary items under gaap  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis 
we believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our operating results  ffo should be examined in conjunction with the net income as presented in our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k 
funds from operations do not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and is not an indication of cash available to fund cash needs 
funds from operations should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indicator of the company s operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity 
the following table presents a reconciliation of the company s net income to ffo for the years ended december  and in thousands  except per share data total dollar amount diluted per share year ended year ended december december net income adjustments to derive funds from operations depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization discontinued operations minority interest depreciation and amortization adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures preferred dividends convertible preferred dividends gain on real estate and joint venture interests minority interest unit holders diluted share adjustment for convertible preferred stock funds from operations applicable to common shareholders page of inflation in the last five years  inflation has not had a significant impact on the company because of the relatively low inflation rate in the company s geographic areas of operation 
most of the leases require the tenants to pay their pro rata share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes and insurance  thereby reducing the company s exposure to increases in operating expenses resulting from inflation 
in addition  the company s leases typically have three to seven year terms  which may enable the company to replace existing leases with new leases at market base rent  which may be higher or lower than the existing lease rate
