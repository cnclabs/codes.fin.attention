item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
we are a provider of primary care physician services 
through our network of medical centers and ipas located in miami dade  broward and hillsborough counties  florida  we were responsible for providing primary care medical services or overseeing the provision of primary care services by affiliated physicians to approximately  patients on a risk basis and approximately  patients on a limited or non risk basis as of june  in fiscal  approximately of our revenue was generated by providing services to medicare eligible members under full risk agreements that require us to assume responsibility to provide and pay for all of our patients medical needs in exchange for a capitated fee  typically a percentage of the premium received by an hmo from various payor sources 
effective january   we entered into the risk ipa agreement with humana under which we agreed to assume certain management responsibilities on a risk basis for humana s medicare and medicaid members assigned to ipas practicing in miami dade and broward counties  florida 
under the risk ipa agreement  we receive a capitation fee established as a percentage of premium that humana receives for its members who have selected the ipas as their primary care physicians and assume responsibility for the cost of all medical services provided to these members  even those we do not provide directly 
during fiscal  medical service revenue and medical services expenses related to the risk ipa agreement approximated million and million  respectively 
as of june   the ipas provided services to or for approximately  medicare and medicaid patients enrolled in humana managed care plans 
the risk ipa agreement replaces the humana pgp agreement that was terminated effective december  under the humana pgp agreement  we assumed certain management responsibilities on a non risk basis for humana s medicare  medicaid and commercial members assigned to selected primary care physicians in miami dade and broward counties  florida 
revenue from this contract consisted of a monthly management fee intended to cover the costs of providing these services and amounted to approximately million and million during fiscal and  respectively 
in an effort to streamline and stem operating losses  effective january   we terminated the medicare and medicaid lines of business for all of the physician contracts associated with one of our ipas  which consisted of physicians at the time of termination 
additionally  in december  we implemented a plan to dispose of our home health operations 
the home health disposition occurred in three separate transactions and was concluded on february  as a result of these transactions  the operations of the terminated ipas and our home health operations are shown as discontinued operations 
medicare considerations substantially all of our net medical services revenue from continuing operations is based upon medicare funded programs 
the federal government from time to time explores ways to reduce medical care costs through medicare reform and through health care reform generally 
any changes that would limit  reduce or delay receipt of medicare funding or any developments that would disqualify us from receiving medicare funding could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  prospects  financial results  financial condition or cash flows 
due to the diverse range of proposals put forth and the uncertainty of any proposal s adoption  we cannot predict what impact any medicare reform proposal ultimately adopted may have on our business  financial position or results of operations 
on january   the medicare prescription drug plan created by the medicare modernization act became effective 
as a result  our hmo affiliates have established or expanded prescription drug benefit plans for their medicare advantage members 
under the terms of our risk arrangements  we are financially responsible for a substantial portion of the cost of the prescription drugs our patients receive  and  in exchange  our hmo affiliates have agreed to provide us with an additional per member capitated fee related to prescription drug coverage 
however  there can be no assurance that the additional fee that we receive will be sufficient to reimburse us for the additional costs that we may incur under the new medicare prescription drug plan 
in addition  the premiums our hmo affiliates receive from cms for their medicare prescription drug plans is subject to periodic adjustment  positive or negative  based upon the application of risk corridors that compare their plans revenues targeted in their bids to actual prescription drug costs 
variances exceeding certain thresholds may result in cms making additional payments to the hmos or require the hmos to refund to cms a portion of the payments they received 
our hmo affiliates estimate and periodically adjust premium revenues related to the risk corridor payment adjustment  and a portion of the hmo s estimated premium revenue adjustment is allocated to us 
as a result  revenue recognized under our risk arrangements with our hmo affiliates are net of the portion of the estimated risk corridor adjustment allocated to us 
the portion of any such risk corridor adjustment that the hmos allocate to us may not directly correlate to the historical utilization patterns of our patients or the costs that we may incur in future periods 
during fiscal  one of our hmo affiliates allocated to us an adjustment related to their risk corridor payment which had the effect of reducing our operating income by approximately million 
no amount was recorded in fiscal as the medicare 
table of contents prescription drug plan program was not then effective 
the medicare prescription drug plan has also been subject to significant public criticism and controversy  and members of congress have discussed possible changes to the program as well as ways to reduce the program s cost to the federal government 
we cannot predict what impact  if any  these developments may have on the medicare prescription drug plan or on our future financial results 
acquisition on may   we entered into the mdhc agreement 
under the mdhc agreement  one of our subsidiaries will acquire substantially all of the assets and operations of the mdhc companies and assume certain liabilities of the mdhc companies the acquisition 
the acquisition is intended to qualify as a tax free reorganization under section a of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
under the terms of the mdhc agreement  at the closing  we will pay the mdhc companies million cash and issue million shares of the company s common stock the shares to the mdhc companies 
we will also pay the principal shareholders of the mdhc companies an additional million cash on the first anniversary date of the closing 
in addition  upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the agreement  following the closing we will pay to those shareholders up to million based on the monthly payments in respect of the mdhc companies business operations that we or any of our subsidiaries receive from certain identified third party payors during the fourteen day period commencing the day after the closing date 
we will also make certain other payments to the mdhc companies principal shareholders depending on the collection of certain receivables that were fully reserved on the books of the mdhc companies as of december  the purchase price  including acquisition costs  will be allocated to the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the closing date 
we expect to fund estimated cash consideration with cash flow from operations or  if necessary  borrowings under our credit facility 
consummation of the acquisition is contingent upon  among other things  the requisite vote of our shareholders approving the issuance of shares pursuant to the agreement  the audit of the mdhc companies financial statements not reflecting any material adverse audit adjustments from the unaudited financial statements and that such audited financial statements reflect adjusted ebitda of at least million for the year ended december   approval of the transaction by certain regulatory and governmental authorities and receipt of necessary third party consents 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements and accompanying notes requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
certain of the amounts recorded on our financial statements could change materially under different  yet still reasonable  estimates and assumptions 
we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience  knowledge of current events and expectations of future events  and we continuously evaluate and update our estimates and assumptions 
however  our estimates and assumptions may ultimately prove to be incorrect or incomplete and  as a result  our actual results may differ materially from those previously reported 
we believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition under our risk contracts with hmos  we receive a percentage of premium or other capitated fee for each patient that chooses one of our physicians as their primary care physician 
revenue under these agreements is generally recorded in the period we assume responsibility to provide services at the rates then in effect as determined by the respective contract 
as part of the medicare advantage program  cms periodically recomputes the premiums to be paid to the hmos based on updated health status of participants and updated demographic factors 
we record any adjustments to this revenue at the time that the information necessary to make the determination of the adjustment is received from the hmo or cms 
under our risk agreements  we assume responsibility for the cost of all medical services provided to the patient  even those we do not provide directly  in exchange for a percentage of premium or other capitated fee 
to the extent that patients require more frequent or expensive care  our revenue under a contract may be insufficient to cover the costs of care provided 
when it is probable that expected future health care costs and maintenance costs under a contract or group of existing contracts will exceed anticipated capitated revenue on those contracts  we recognize losses on our prepaid health care services with hmos 
no contracts were considered loss contracts at june  because we have the right to terminate unprofitable physicians and close unprofitable centers under our managed care contracts 

table of contents under our limited risk and no risk contracts with hmos  we receive a capitation fee or management fee based on the number of patients for which we are providing services on a monthly basis 
the capitation fee or management fee is recorded as revenue in the period in which services are provided as determined by the respective contract 
medical claims expense recognition the cost of health care services provided or contracted for is accrued in the period in which the services are provided 
this cost includes our estimate of the related liability for medical claims incurred in the period but not yet reported  or ibnr 
ibnr represents a material portion of our medical claims liability which is presented in the balance sheet net of amounts due from hmos 
changes in this estimate can materially affect  either favorably or unfavorably  our results from operations and overall financial position 
we develop our estimate of ibnr primarily based on historical claims incurred per member per month 
we adjust our estimate if we have unusually high or low inpatient utilization or if benefit changes provided under the hmo plans are expected to significantly increase or reduce our claims exposure 
we also adjust our estimate for differences between the estimated claims expense recorded in prior months to actual claims expense as claims are paid by the hmo and reported to us 
to further corroborate our estimate of medical claims  an independent actuarial calculation is performed for us on a quarterly basis 
this independent actuarial calculation indicates that ibnr as of june  was between approximately million and million 
based on our internal analysis and the independent actuarial calculation  as of june   we recorded a liability of approximately million for ibnr 
the increase in the liability for ibnr of million or to million as of june  from million as of june  was primarily due to the additional liability recorded for ibnr related to the ipas converted to a risk arrangement 
the liability for ibnr remained relatively unchanged at million and million as of june  and  respectively 
consideration of impairment related to goodwill and other intangible assets our balance sheet includes intangible assets  including goodwill and other separately identifiable intangible assets  which represented approximately of our total assets at june  if we complete the acquisition our intangible assets are expected to represent approximately of our total assets 
under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are no longer amortized  but are reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if certain indicators of permanent impairment arise 
intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized over their respective useful lives to their estimated residual values and also reviewed for impairment annually  or more frequently if certain indicators of permanent impairment arise 
indicators of a permanent impairment include  among other things  a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate  the loss of a key hmo contract  an adverse action by a regulator  unanticipated competition  the loss of key personnel or allocation of goodwill to a portion of business that is to be sold 
because we operate in a single segment of business  we have determined that we have a single reporting unit and we perform our impairment test for goodwill on an enterprise level 
in performing the impairment test  we compare the total current market value of all of our outstanding common stock  to the current carrying value of our total net assets  including goodwill and intangible assets 
depending on the market value of our common stock at the time that an impairment test is required  there is a risk that a portion of our intangible assets would be considered impaired and must be written off during that period 
we completed our annual impairment test on may   and determined that no indicators of impairment existed 
accordingly  no impairment charges were required at june  should we later determine that an indicator of impairment exists  we would be required to perform an additional impairment test 
realization of deferred tax assets we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we estimate our income taxes based on our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
we also recognize as deferred tax assets the future tax benefits from net operating loss carryforwards 
we evaluate the realizability of these deferred tax assets by assessing their valuation allowances and by adjusting the amount of such allowances  if necessary 
among the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are our projections of future taxable income streams  the 
table of contents expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences  and the impact of tax planning strategies that could be implemented to avoid the potential loss of future tax benefits 
however  changes in tax codes  statutory tax rates or future taxable income levels could materially impact our valuation of tax accruals and assets and could cause our provision for income taxes to vary significantly from period to period 
at june   we had deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities of approximately million 
during fiscal  we determined that it is more likely than not that those assets will be realized although realization is not assured  resulting in no valuation allowance at june  stock based compensation expense effective july   we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective transition method 
prior to the adoption of sfas r we followed accounting principles board opinion no 
 apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations in accounting for its employee stock options 
the adoption of sfas no 
r had no effect on cash flow from operations and cash flow from financing activities for fiscal sfas r requires us to recognize compensation costs related to our share based payment transactions with employees in our financial statements 
sfas r requires us to calculate this cost based on the grant date fair value of the equity instrument 
as a result of adopting sfas no 
r on july   for fiscal  the company s income before income taxes was lower by million and net income was lower by million than if it had continued to account for share based compensation under apb no 
as of june   there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non vested stock options  which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
consistent with our practices prior to adopting sfas r  we have elected to calculate the fair value of our employee stock options using the black scholes option pricing model 
using this model we calculated the fair value for employee stock options granted during fiscal based on the following assumptions risk free interest rate ranging from to  dividend yield of  weighted average volatility factor of the expected market price of our common stock of  and weighted average expected life of the options ranging from to years  depending on the vesting provisions of each option 
based on the black scholes model and our assumptions  we recognized stock based employee compensation expense of million for fiscal the expected life of the options is based on the historical exercise behavior of the company s employees 
the expected volatility factor is based on the historical volatility of the market price of the company s common stock as adjusted for certain events that management deemed to be non recurring and non indicative of future events 
sfas r does not require the use of any particular option valuation model 
because our stock options have characteristics significantly different from traded options and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate  in management s opinion  it is possible that existing models may not necessarily provide a reliable measure of the fair value of our employee stock options 
we selected the black scholes model based on our prior experience with it  its wide use by issuers comparable to us  and our review of alternate option valuation models 
based on these factors  we believe that the black scholes model and the assumptions we made in applying it provide a reasonable estimate of the fair value of our employee stock options 
the effect of applying the fair value method of accounting for stock options on reported net income for any period may not be representative of the effects for future periods because our outstanding options typically vest over a period of several years and additional awards may be made in future periods 

table of contents results of operations the following tables set forth  for the periods indicated  selected operating data as a percentage of total revenue 
year ended june  revenue medical services revenue  net management fee revenue and other income total revenue operating expenses medical services medical claims other direct costs total medical services administrative payroll and employee benefits general and administrative gain on extinguishment of debt total operating expenses income from operations other income expense interest income interest expense medicare settlement related to terminated operations income from continuing operations before income tax provision benefit income tax provision benefit income from continuing operations income loss from discontinued operations home health operations terminated ipas total loss from discontinued operations net income comparison of fiscal year ended june  to fiscal year ended june  revenue medical services revenue increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the increase in our medical services revenue was primarily the result of increases in our medicare revenue  partially offset by a decrease in commercial revenue of approximately million which resulted primarily from the conversion of certain commercial members of an hmo from a risk arrangement to a non risk arrangement during fiscal the most significant component of our medical services revenue is the revenue we generate from medicare patients under risk arrangements which increased by million  or  during fiscal during fiscal revenue generated by our medicare risk arrangements increased approximately on a per patient per month basis and medicare patient months increased by approximately over fiscal the increase in medicare revenue was primarily due to revenue associated with the ipas that were converted from a non risk arrangement to a risk arrangement effective january   higher per patient per month premiums and the increased phase in of the medicare risk adjustment program 
under the medicare risk adjustment program  the health status and demographic factors of medicare advantage participants are taken into account in determining premiums paid for each participant 
cms periodically recomputes the premiums to be paid to the hmos based on updated health status  demographic factors and  in the case of medicare prescription drug plan benefits cms s risk corridor adjustment methodology 
medicare risk adjustments recorded during fiscal and resulted in increases to our medical services revenue 
future medicare risk adjustments may result in reductions of revenue depending on the future health status and demographic factors of our patients as well as the application of cms s risk corridor methodology to the hmos medicare prescription drug programs 
the increase in medicare patient months was primarily due to the conversion of the ipas from a non risk arrangement to a risk arrangement effective january  
table of contents management fee revenue and other income of million and million for fiscal and  respectively  related primarily to revenue generated under our limited risk and non risk contracts under the humana pgp agreement 
revenue generated under contracts with humana accounted for approximately and of our medical services revenue for fiscal and  respectively 
revenue generated under contracts with vista accounted for approximately and of our medical services revenue for fiscal and  respectively 
operating expenses medical services expenses are comprised of medical claims expense and other direct costs related to the provision of medical services to our patients including a portion of our stock based compensation expense 
because our risk contracts with hmos provide that we are financially responsible for all medical services provided to our patients under those contracts  our medical claims expense includes the costs of prescription drugs our patients receive as well as medical services provided to patients under our risk contracts by providers other than us 
other direct costs include the salaries  taxes and benefits of our health professionals providing primary care services  medical malpractice insurance costs  capitation payments to our ipa physicians and other costs related to the provision of medical services to our patients 
medical services expenses for fiscal increased by million  or  to million from million for fiscal this increase is primarily due to an increase in medical claims expense which is the largest component of medical services expense 
medical claims expense increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal primarily as a result of a increase on a per patient per month basis in medical claims expenses related to our medicare patients and a increase in medicare patient months 
the increase in per patient per month medical claims expense is primarily attributable to enhanced benefits offered by our hmo affiliates and inflationary trends in the health care industry 
the increase in medicare patient months is primarily attributable to the conversion of the ipas to a risk arrangement effective january  notwithstanding the increase in the amount of our medical services expenses during fiscal  the increase in our medical services revenue more than offset the increase in our medical services expenses 
medical services expenses decreased to of total revenue for fiscal as compared to for fiscal our claims loss ratio medical claims expense as a percentage of medical services revenue  however  increased to in fiscal from in fiscal this increase was primarily due to the higher historical claims loss ratio experienced by the ipas that were converted from a non risk arrangement to a risk arrangement effective january  in addition  our hmo affiliates have enhanced certain benefits offered to medicare patients for calendar hmos are under continuous competitive pressure to enhance the benefits they offer to their members 
however  the premiums cms pays to hmos for medicare advantage members are generally not increased as a result of those benefit enhancements 
as a result  we expect hmos will be under continuing competitive pressure to offer more  and possibly more expensive  benefits to their medicare advantage members in exchange for the same premium 
this may result in an increase in our claims loss ratio in future periods  which could reduce our profitability and cash flows 
in addition  the ipas converted to a risk arrangement have historically experienced a higher claims loss ratio than our other operations 
while we will seek to reduce the claims loss ratio of those ipas to a level comparable to that of our other operations  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in doing so 
if we are not successful in reducing the claims loss ratio of those ipas our profitability and cash flows may be adversely affected 
however  we cannot quantify what impact  if any  these developments may have on our claims loss ratio which fluctuates from period to period or results of operations in future periods 
other direct costs increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal as a percentage of total revenue  other direct costs decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal the increase in the amount of other direct costs was primarily due to an increase in capitation fees paid to the ipas 
administrative payroll and employee benefits expense increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal as a percentage of total revenue  administrative payroll and employee benefits expense increased to for fiscal from for fiscal the increase in administrative payroll and employee benefits expense was due to the recognition of stock based employee compensation expense  which was not required to be recognized in fiscal  and an increase in incentive plan accruals 
general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal as a percentage of total revenue  general and administrative expenses decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in professional fees and depreciation expense 
income from operations 
table of contents income from operations for fiscal decreased by million  or  to million from million for fiscal due primarily to a million gain on extinguishment of debt recognized in fiscal interest income interest income increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the increase in interest income was primarily due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents and an increase in interest rates earned on such investments 
interest expense interest expense decreased by million  or  to  for fiscal from million for fiscal the decrease in interest expense was related to the amortization of deferred financing costs during fiscal the deferred financing costs were fully amortized as of march  and  accordingly  no related interest expense was recorded during fiscal taxes an income tax provision of million and an income tax benefit of million were recorded for fiscal and  respectively 
as of june   we determined that no valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was necessary and we decreased our valuation allowance by million for fiscal this decision eliminated our valuation allowance and represented a one time gain 
net income net income for fiscal decreased by million to million from million for fiscal due primarily to the gain on extinguishment of debt recognized in fiscal and the increase in the income tax provision resulting from the recognition of an income tax provision of million in fiscal compared to a million income tax benefit recorded in fiscal comparison of fiscal year ended june  to fiscal year ended june  revenue from continuing operations medical services revenue increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the increase in our medical services revenue was primarily the result of increases in our medicare revenue  partially offset by a decrease in commercial revenue of approximately million which resulted primarily from the conversion of certain commercial members of an hmo from a risk arrangement to a non risk arrangement during fiscal during fiscal  revenue generated by our medicare full risk arrangements increased approximately on a per patient per month basis as compared to fiscal  but this increase was partially offset by a decrease of approximately in medicare patient months from fiscal the increase in medicare revenue was primarily due to higher per patient per month premiums resulting from the medicare modernization act and the increased phase in of the medicare risk adjustment program  both of which became effective in january our fiscal medical services revenue also included an additional million of medicare advantage funding that we received from an hmo in december and medicare risk adjustments of approximately million that we earned during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal management fee revenue and other income of million and million for fiscal and  respectively  related primarily to revenue generated under our limited risk and non risk contracts under the humana pgp agreement 
revenue from continuing operations generated by our managed care entities under contracts with humana accounted for approximately and of our medical services revenue for fiscal and  respectively 
revenue from continuing operations generated by our managed care entities under contracts with vista accounted for and of our medical services revenue for fiscal and  respectively 
expenses from continuing operations medical services expenses for fiscal increased by million  or  to million from million for fiscal however  as a percentage of total revenue  medical services expenses decreased to for fiscal as compared to for fiscal medical claims expense increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal primarily as a result of higher medical costs and an increase in utilization of health care services by our medicare patients  partially offset by a decrease in claims expense of approximately million which resulted from the conversion of certain commercial members of an hmo from a risk arrangement to a non risk arrangement during fiscal as a result of 
table of contents these developments  during fiscal our medical claims expense related to our medicare patients increased on a per patient per month basis by approximately 
notwithstanding the increase in the amount of our medical services expenses and claims expense during fiscal  the increase in our medical services revenue more than offset the increase in our medical services expenses and claims expense 
as a result  our claims loss ratio medical claims expense as a percentage of medical services revenue decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal other direct costs increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal as a percentage of total revenue  other direct costs decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal the increase in the amount of other direct costs was primarily due to an increase in payroll expense and related benefits for physicians and medical support personnel at our medical centers and an increase in incentive plan accruals 
administrative payroll and employee benefits expense increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal as a percentage of total revenue  administrative payroll and employee benefits expense increased to for fiscal from for fiscal the increase in administrative payroll and employee benefits expense was due to an increase in salaries related to the hiring of additional marketing and executive personnel and an increase in incentive plan accruals 
general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal as a percentage of total revenue  general and administrative expenses increased to for fiscal from for fiscal the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in professional fees and the settlement of two lawsuits during fiscal which reduced our accrual for legal claims by million during that fiscal year 
the million and million gain on extinguishment of debt recognized during fiscal and  respectively  related to the million contract modification note with humana that was cancelled in april simultaneously with the note cancellation  we executed the humana pgp agreement 
the humana pgp agreement contained a provision for liquidated damages in the amount of million  which could be asserted by humana under certain circumstances 
to the extent that humana reduced the maximum amount of liquidated damages  we recognized gains from extinguishment of debt in a corresponding amount 
in fiscal and fiscal  humana notified us that the maximum amount of liquidated damages had been reduced from million to and from million to million  respectively 
accordingly  we recognized million and million of the deferred gain on extinguishment of debt in fiscal and  respectively 
income from operations income from operations for fiscal increased by million  or  to million from million for fiscal income from operations for fiscal increased to of total revenue as compared to of total revenue for fiscal medicare settlement related to terminated operations during fiscal  we recorded other income of million relating to the settlement of an alleged medicare obligation 
the alleged obligation related to rehabilitation clinics that were previously operated by one of our former subsidiaries and were sold in cms had alleged that medicare overpayments were made relating to services rendered by these clinics and other related clinics during a period in which the clinics were operated by entities other than us 
we requested that cms reconsider the alleged liability  and in october we were notified that the liability had been reduced from the originally asserted amount of million to million 
loss from discontinued operations home health operations our home health operations contributed million in revenue and generated an operating loss of million which included charges in connection with the disposition of million during fiscal income from discontinued operations terminated ipas the terminated ipas did not contribute any revenue but generated operating income of  during fiscal income generated by the terminated ipas during fiscal resulted from a settlement with the hmo which eliminated all amounts due to and amounts due from the hmo incurred prior to the termination of the contracts on january  taxes 
table of contents as described above  as of june   we determined that no valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was necessary and we decreased our valuation allowance by million for fiscal this decision had the effect of increasing our fiscal net income by approximately million 
since this decision eliminated our entire valuation allowance  it represented a one time gain that did not contribute to our earnings in future periods 
no provision for income taxes was recorded in fiscal due primarily to the utilization of prior year net operating loss carryforwards 
as a result of our utilization of deferred tax assets during fiscal  we reduced the valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets by million as of june  to offset income tax liabilities that were generated from current operations 
net income net income for fiscal increased by million  or  to million from million for fiscal liquidity and capital resources at june   working capital was million  an increase of million from working capital of million at june  the increase in working capital for fiscal was primarily due to income before income tax provision of million recognized in fiscal cash and cash equivalents were million at june  compared to million at june  net cash of million was provided by operating activities from continuing operations during fiscal compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the decrease of million in cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations during fiscal was primarily due to an increase in amounts due from hmos of million 
the increase of million in cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations during fiscal was primarily due to an increase in income from operations of million  an increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities of million  and a decrease in the medicare settlement related to terminated operations of million recognized in fiscal  which were partially offset by an increase in extinguishment of debt of million 
net cash of million was used for investing activities from continuing operations in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase of million in cash used for investing activities from continuing operations during fiscal was primarily due to an increase in other assets of million related to capitalized acquisition costs 
the increase of million in cash used for investing activities from continuing operations during fiscal was primarily due to an increase in the purchase of equipment of million and the purchase of a million certificate of deposit 
net cash of million was used in financing activities from continuing operations in fiscal compared to net cash used of million in fiscal the decrease of million in cash used in financing activities from continuing operations in fiscal was primarily due to a decrease of million in cash used for the repurchase of common stock 
the increase of million in cash used in financing activities from continuing operations in fiscal was primarily due to the repurchase of common stock of million which was partially offset by an increase in proceeds of million from the promissory note payable to humana discussed below 
effective march   we obtained an extension and amended the terms of our credit facility that provides for a revolving loan to us the credit facility 
the maturity date of the credit facility was extended until september   the maximum amount available for borrowing under the credit facility was increased to  and the interest rate under the credit facility was reduced to the sum of plus the day dealer commercial paper rate 
in addition  a financial covenant was added to the credit facility requiring our ebitda to exceed  on a trailing month basis and the financial covenant that previously required us to maintain aggregate cash  unencumbered marketable securities and other financial assets of at least  at any time during which amounts were outstanding under the credit facility was deleted 
all other terms of the credit facility remained substantially unchanged 
pursuant to the terms under our managed care agreements with certain of our hmo affiliates  we posted irrevocable standby letters of credit amounting to million to secure our payment obligations to those hmos 
we are required to maintain these letters of credit throughout the term of the managed care agreements 
in may  our board of directors increased our previously announced program to repurchase shares of our common stock to a total of  shares 
any such repurchases will be made from time to time at the discretion of our management in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions subject to market conditions and other factors 
we anticipate that any such repurchases of shares will be funded through cash from operations 
as of september   we had repurchased  shares of our common stock for approximately million 

table of contents on may   we  entered into the mdhc agreement 
under the agreement  one of our subsidiaries will acquire substantially all of the assets and operations of the mdhc companies and assume certain of their liabilities 
under the terms of the mdhc agreement  at the closing  we will pay the mdhc companies million cash and issue million shares of the our common stock to the mdhc companies 
we will also pay the principal shareholders of the mdhc companies an additional million cash on the first anniversary date of the closing 
in addition  upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the agreement  following the closing we will pay to those shareholders up to million based on the monthly payments in respect of the mdhc companies business operations that we or any of our subsidiaries receive from certain identified third party payors during the fourteen day period commencing the day after the closing date 
we will also make certain other payments to the mdhc companies principal shareholders depending on the collection of certain receivables that were fully reserved as of december  we expect to fund estimated cash consideration with cash flows from operations or  if necessary  borrowings under our credit facility 
we believe that we will be able to fund our capital commitments  our anticipated operating cash requirements for the foreseeable future and satisfy any remaining obligations from our working capital  anticipated cash flows from operations  and our credit facility 
off balance sheet arrangements we had no off balance sheet arrangements as of june   and have not entered into any transactions involving unconsolidated  limited purpose entities or commodity contracts 
contractual obligations the following is a summary of our long term debt  capital and operating lease obligations  and contractual obligations as of june  payment due by period total less than year years years capital lease obligations operating lease obligations total the payments shown above for capital lease obligations and operating lease obligations reflect all payments due under the terms of the respective leases 
see note to our consolidated financial statements to reconcile the payments shown above to the capital lease obligations recorded in our consolidated balance sheets 
other factors that could affect our liquidity and cash flow are discussed elsewhere in this annual report 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at june   we had only certificates of deposit and cash equivalents invested in high grade  short term securities  which are not typically subject to material market risk 
we have capital lease obligations outstanding at fixed rates 
for capital lease obligations with fixed interest rates  a hypothetical change in interest rates would have no material impact on our future earnings and cash flows related to these instruments and would have an immaterial impact on the fair value of these instruments 
our credit facility is interest rate sensitive  however  we had no amount outstanding under this facility at june  we have no risk associated with foreign currency exchange rates or commodity prices
