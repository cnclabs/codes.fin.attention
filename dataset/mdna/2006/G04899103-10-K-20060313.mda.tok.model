item business overview we were incorporated on september  under the laws of bermuda as a jointly owned subsidiary of stena ab publ  or stena  and concordia maritime ab publ  or concordia  a swedish company and an affiliate of stena 
stena is one of the largest privately held companies in sweden  with over  employees 
concordia has been involved in the shipping business for over years 
stena and concodia continue to be shareholders of the company 
our fleet consists of eight tankers 
on november   we acquired our original fleet of six tankers consisting of two v max tankers  two panamax tankers and two product tankers 
on january  we acquired two additional product tankers 
we have eight wholly owned subsidiaries  each of which owns one of the tankers in our fleet 
we purchased the two v max tankers from subsidiaries of concordia  the four product tankers from subsidiaries of stena and the two panamax tankers from two companies owned by stena and by fram shipping ltd  which we refer to as fram 
we have chartered our two v max tankers to two wholly owned subsidiaries of concordia  which have currently sub chartered those tankers to sun international 
we acquired the two v max tankers subject to 
table of contents existing sub charters with sun international limited bermuda  an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of sunoco  inc which we refer to as sun international 
one of these sub charters expires in june and the other expires in september we have chartered our two panamax tankers and four product tankers to stena bulk ab  a wholly owned subsidiary of stena 
we refer to our charters for our vessels as the charters 
we refer to these two concordia subsidiaries and stena bulk ab collectively as the charterers 
our purchase of the v max tankers from subsidiaries of concordia and our chartering of these vessels back to these concordia subsidiaries do not affect the existing fixed rate sub charters with sun international 
the charters have fixed terms with between three and five years remaining 
there are also charter period options exercisable by the charterers 
the charters provide for a fixed base charter rate and  in some cases  the potential to earn additional hire as explained below under the caption additional hire 
each of our wholly owned subsidiaries has also entered into a fixed rate ship management agreement with northern marine management ltd  a wholly owned subsidiary of stena which we refer to as northern marine  to provide for the operation and maintenance of each of our vessels 
we believe that our fleet is one of the youngest in the world  with an average age as of january  of approximately years compared to the world average of years for all tankers according to clarkson research studies ltd 
the two v max tankers  which came into service in are approximately four years old  and the panamax and product tankers  which came into service during and  are each less than two years old 
all of our tankers have double hulls and are of very high quality 
strategy our strategy is designed to generate stable and generally predictable cash flow through long term fixed rate charters  which reduces our exposure to volatility in the market for seaborne oil and oil product transportation 
we intend to pay dividends in accordance with our dividend policy  which is described below in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dividend policy 
the following are the key elements of our strategy acquire high quality tankers 
our two v max tankers were built in and our six other tankers were completed during and all of our tankers have double hulls and have been designed to provide more efficient transportation of oil and oil products compared to other standard ship designs 
we will consider acquiring additional tankers in the future 
any such acquisition will require additional financing and the consent of our lenders under our credit facility 
time charter our tankers to experienced charterers 
we time charter our tankers to subsidiaries of stena and concordia 
stena and concordia have agreed to guarantee their respective subsidiaries obligations under the charters 
stena operates a fleet of oil tankers 
stena s current customers for its fleet of owned and chartered in tankers include major oil companies such as chevrontexaco corporation  the royal dutch shell group of companies  conocophillips and bp plc the two v max tankers in our fleet were owned by concordia and have been chartered to sun international since their delivery 
charter our tankers under long term fixed rate charters 
our existing charters are designed to generate stable and generally predictable cash flow and reduce our exposure to the volatility in tanker spot rates 
in some of our charters we have preserved an opportunity to earn additional hire during favorable market conditions 
the charterhire payable to us under our charters will increase annually by an amount equal to the annual increase in the fees payable by us under the ship management agreements 
arrange for ship management contracts with an experienced ship manager 
we have entered into ship management contracts with northern marine for each of our vessels 
under these agreements  northern marine has assumed all responsibilities for the technical management of the vessels  including crewing  maintenance  repair  drydocking and insurance for a fixed daily fee per vessel which increases annually 
in addition  northern marine has agreed to indemnify us for our loss of basic hire in the event  for circumstances specified under the charters  the vessel is off hire or receiving 
table of contents reduced hire for more than five days during any twelve month period  net of amounts received from off hire insurance 
these arrangements are designed to provide stable and generally predictable operating costs for our fleet 
competitive strengths we believe that our fleet  together with our contractual arrangements with the charterers and northern marine  give us a number of competitive strengths  including one of the youngest fleets of tankers in the world  diversified exposure to three segments of the tanker market  two unique v max tankers  vessels managed by northern marine  which we believe is one of the industry s most qualified vessel managers  fixed rate time charters intended to provide stable and generally predictable cash flow  reducing our exposure to volatility in tanker spot rates  and in six of our charters  profit sharing agreements  providing the opportunity to earn additional revenue  and fixed operating costs under our ship management agreements 
our fleet we acquired our original six tankers from stena  concordia and fram concurrently with the completion of our initial public offering on november  we acquired stena concept and stena contest from stena on january  the following chart summarizes certain information about our fleet 
vessel type year built dwt flag date acquired v max stena victory  bermuda november  stena vision  bermuda november  panamax stena companion  bermuda november  stena compatriot  bermuda november  product stena concord  bermuda november  stena consul  bermuda november  stena concept  bermuda january  stena contest  bermuda january  all of our tankers have double hulls and are of very high quality 
these tankers are fitted with long term planned maintenance software programs so that all routine machinery adjustments are done effectively and with minimal disruption in service 
our v max tankers were designed by stena and concordia to provide more efficient transportation and increased safety over standard vlccs 
the body of our v max tankers is wider than a conventional vlcc 
this enables the vessels to carry more cargo at a shallower draft  which lowers transportation costs 
our v max tankers also have two rudders and propellers which improve vessel maneuverability and port access 
these tankers have been designed for a structural fatigue life of years 
our v max tankers typically load crude oil in west africa and discharge in philadelphia  which is a port that cannot be accessed by conventional vlccs 
our panamax tankers have fully epoxy coated tanks and a tank design that permit the vessels to change from transporting dirty to clean petroleum products faster than a standard vessel of this class 
our panamax 
table of contents tankers also have integrated bridge systems  unique in vessels of this class  that provide increased efficiency  safety  visibility  communication and maneuvering capabilities to the bridge team navigating the vessel 
our panamax tankers typically trade in the north  south and central americas primarily carrying crude oil but also dirty products 
our product tankers have one of the most efficient designs for vessels in this class with completely independent multiple grade cargo segregations providing increased flexibility over the six segregations standard in product tankers 
compared to standard vessels in this class  our product tankers also have more powerful engines that provide flexibility to respond to weather conditions and market demands and a tank design that permits quicker discharge and reduced tank preparation time to load the next cargo 
our product tankers currently trade primarily in the caribbean and the transatlantic and primarily carry clean products such as gasoline  diesel and jetfuel 
charter arrangements the following summary of the material terms of the charters does not purport to be complete and is subject to  and qualified in its entirety by reference to  all the provisions of the charters 
because the following is only a summary  it does not contain all information that you may find useful 
for more complete information  you should read the entire time charter party for each vessel filed as an exhibit to this annual report on form k 
general our wholly owned subsidiaries have time chartered our vessels to the charterers 
upon completion of our initial public offering in november  each of our original six vessels was chartered for a fixed term expiring in november  followed by three one year options exercisable at the option of the charterers 
in january  in connection with our acquisition of two additional product tankers from stena  the fixed term for one of our product tankers stena consul and one of our panamax tankers stena compatriot was extended to november  followed by three one year options exercisable by the charterer and the fixed term for one of our product tankers stena concord and one of our panamax tankers stena companion was reduced to november  followed by three one year options exercisable by the charterer 
the terms of the charters for our v max tankers were not amended 
the fixed charter period for the two product tankers that we acquired in january expires in january at the end of the initial three year period  both we and the charterer have the option to extend the time charters on a vessel by vessel basis for an additional months 
furthermore  if the charterer exercises the month option  there will be two additional one year options  exercisable by the charterer 
we have agreed to guarantee the obligations of each of our subsidiaries under the charters 
the charterers are stena bulk ab  a wholly owned subsidiary of stena  and cm v max i limited and cm v max ii limited  each a wholly owned subsidiary of concordia 
under the charters  we are required to keep the vessels seaworthy  and to crew and maintain them 
northern marine performs those duties for us under the ship management agreements described below 
if a structural change or new equipment is required due to changes in law  classification society or regulatory requirements  the charterers will be required to pay for such changes if the cost is less than  per year per vessel 
otherwise the cost of any such improvement or change will be shared between us and the charterer of the vessel based on the remaining charter period and the remaining depreciation period of the vessel calculated as years from the year built 
the charterers are not obligated to pay us charterhire for off hire days of fewer than five days per vessel per year  which include days a vessel is unable to be in service due to  among other things  repairs or drydockings 
each charter also provides that the basic hire will be reduced if the vessel does not achieve the performance specifications set forth in the charter 
however  under the ship management agreements described below  northern marine will reimburse us for any loss of or reduction in basic hire  in excess of five days during any twelve month period following the date the vessels are delivered to us  net of any proceeds we receive from our off hire insurance 

table of contents the terms of the charters do not provide the charterers with an option to terminate the charter before the end of its term 
however  the charters may terminate in the event of the total loss or constructive total loss of a vessel 
in addition  each charter provides that we may not sell the related vessel without the charterer s consent  which consent may be withheld at the charterer s sole discretion 
the two v max tankers that we have chartered to subsidiaries of concordia are currently chartered to sun international  an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of sunoco 
our purchase of the v max tankers from the subsidiaries of concordia and our chartering of these vessels back to these concordia subsidiaries did not affect the existing fixed rate charters with sun international 
sunoco does not guarantee sun international s obligations under the charters 
if sun international defaults under these charters  the subsidiaries of concordia will continue to be obligated under the terms of the charters with us 
concordia has agreed to guarantee the performance of its subsidiaries under the charters  including payment of charterhire 
upon expiration of the sun international charters  which are scheduled to expire days before or after june for one charter and days before or after september for the other  if sun international does not extend a charter with concordia at a time charter rate at least equal to the basic hire under our charters with concordia  we will have the option to terminate that charter with concordia on days prior notice until one year following the expiration of the sun international charters  unless concordia has a entered into new time charters for each of the vessels at a time charter rate at least equal to the basic hire under our charters with concordia for the remainder of the charter period with a company or its subsidiary having a credit rating of bbb or higher from standard poor s rating services or baa or higher from moody s investors service  inc or b provided cash collateral initially in an amount equal to million per charter  decreasing quarterly thereafter pro rata  as security for its payment obligations under the charter 
if we terminate a charter with concordia as described above  stena has agreed to cause stena bulk to charter from us the v max tanker previously subject to that charter at a time charter rate equal to the basic hire under that charter for the remainder of the charter period  and otherwise on the terms and conditions of that charter and to guarantee the obligations of stena bulk under the new charter with us 
the vessels that we have time chartered to stena bulk are not currently subject to any time charters 
stena has agreed to guarantee the performance of stena bulk under the charters  including payment of charterhire 
basic hire the daily base charter rate for each of our vessels  which we refer to as basic hire  is payable to us monthly in advance and will increase annually by an amount equal to the annual increase in the fee payable under the applicable ship management agreement

this period is the first for which the charterer has the option to extend the charters if either one of the charter exercises the option described in footnote above 
the related ship management agreement provides that northern marine will reimburse us for any reduced hire or off hire if the total of the reduced hire and off hire days as specified in the ship management agreement exceeds five days during each twelve month period following the date the vessels are delivered to us to ensure that we receive a total of days of basic hire for each vessel during that period 
however  there is no obligation on the part of northern marine to compensate us for lost additional hire as a result of any off hire periods 
additional hire in addition to the basic hire  the charterers of our vessels other than stena concept and stena contest have agreed to pay us quarterly in arrears an additional payment  which we refer to as the additional hire 
we would be eligible to earn additional hire for stena concept or stena contest if the charterer extends the charters for either such vessel for the initial month option period for such vessels 
we would not be eligible to earn additional hire for such vessels if the charterer exercises the subsequent one year options 
under the charters  the additional hire  if any  in respect of each of our vessels  is payable on the th day following the end of each calendar quarter 
the additional hire  if any  payable in respect of a vessel  other than the v max tankers as described below  for any calendar quarter will be an amount equal to of the weighted average hire for the quarter after deduction of the basic hire in effect for that quarter 
the weighted average hire is defined as a daily rate equal to the weighted average of the following amounts a weighted average of the time charter hire per day received by the charterer for any periods during the calculation period that the vessel is subchartered by the charterer under a time charter  less ship broker commissions paid by the charterer in an amount not to exceed of such time charter hire and commercial management fees paid by the charterer in an amount not to exceed of such time charter hire  and 
table of contents the time charter equivalent hire  calculated as described below  for any periods during the calculation period that the vessel is not subchartered by the charterer under a time charter 
for each calculation period  these amounts will be weighted based on the number of days the vessel was subchartered by the charterer under a time charter during the calculation period and the number of days the vessel was not subchartered by the charterer under a time charter during the calculation period 
there is no obligation to pay additional hire during any period when the obligation to pay basic hire is suspended under the charter if due to technical reasons the vessel is off hire unless the vessel is off hire as a result of a class condition or recommendation determined by the vessel s classification society discovered by us prior to delivery or during the inspection undertaken by us in connection with the purchase of the vessel and such condition or recommendation cannot be remedied or complied with during a regularly scheduled drydocking without increasing the duration of such drydocking 
the calculation period is the twelve month period ending on the last day of each calendar quarter 
if the weighted average hire calculated for any calendar quarter or portion thereof  is equal to or less than the basic hire for the same period  the additional hire for that quarter will be zero 
however  if at the end of any calendar quarter  the deduction of the basic hire from the weighted average hire would result in a negative amount in respect of any vessel  a charterer will have the right to use of that negative amount to reduce any additional hire payable by that charterer for the same quarter in respect of any of our other vessels chartered by that charterer 
in the case of the current sub charters with sun international  we will receive additional hire equal to the difference between the amount paid by sun international under its time charters and the basic hire  less ship broker commissions paid by the charterer in an amount not to exceed of the charterhire received by the charterer and commercial management fees paid by the charterer in an amount not to exceed of the charterhire received by the charterer 
we immediately began earning additional hire under the v max tanker charters because these vessels are currently sub chartered to sun international by subsidiaries of concordia for an amount per day in excess of the basic hire payable to us in respect of these vessels 
we earned additional hire of million in  consisting of million in additional hire for our v max tankers and million for our other vessels 
the time charter equivalent hire referred to above is a weighted average of day rates calculated using the parameters set forth below  which we call the daily value 
the daily value is calculated using average spot rates expressed in worldscale points determined by a shipbrokers panel for the routes specified below which are the routes on which our vessel types generally trade 
we refer to these rates as the average spot rates and we refer to these routes as the notional routes 
daily value is determined as follows multiplying the average spot rate expressed in worldscale points by the applicable worldscale flat rate and multiplying that product by the cargo size for each vessel type to calculate freight income  subtracting voyage costs consisting of brokerage commissions of and commercial management fees of  bunker costs and port charges to calculate voyage income  and dividing voyage income by voyage duration  including time in port  to calculate the daily value 
the time charter equivalent hire is then determined as a weighted average of the daily values calculated for each of the notional routes for each of our vessel types 
in the case of the v max tankers an amount equal to of such weighted average is added to the time charter equivalent hire to adjust for the additional cargo capacity of v max tankers as compared to a standard vlcc 
the shipbrokers panel  which we call the brokers panel  is the association of shipbrokers and agents tanker broker panel 
we can change the panel of brokers to a new panel mutually acceptable to us and the charterer 
on the last day of each calendar quarter and on the expiration date of the charter  we and the charterer will instruct the brokers panel to determine for each notional route the average spot rate over any periods during the calculation period that a vessel is not subchartered by the charterer under a time charter 
if worldscale ceases to be published  the brokers panel will use its best judgment in determining the nearest alternative method of assessing the market rates on the specified voyages 

table of contents we instruct the brokers panel to deliver their determination of the average spot rates no later than the fifth business day following the instruction to make such determination 
the costs of the brokers panel are shared equally between us and the charterer 
for each calculation period  the charterer will calculate the amount of time charter equivalent hire and the amount of additional hire payable  if any  and deliver such calculation to us no later than the fifth business day following the date on which the charterer receives the determination of average spot rates from the brokers panel 
these determinations of the brokers panel are binding on us and the charterer 
the notional routes and the weighting to be applied to each route in calculating the time charter equivalent hire is as follows product tankers rotterdam to new york with  tons clean weight curacao to new york with  tons clean weight panamax tankers curacao to new york with  tons dirty weight augusta to houston with  tons dirty weight v max tankers west africa to loop with  tons of crude weight middle east gulf to loop with  tons of crude weight additional terms used in the calculation of time charter equivalent hire are as follows calculation of freight income 
the freight income for each notional route is calculated by multiplying the average spot rate for such route  as supplied by the brokers panel  by the worldscale flat rate for such route as set forth in the new worldwide tanker nominal freight scale issued by the worldscale association and current for the relevant period and then multiplying such product by the cargo size for such route 
calculation of voyage income 
the voyage income for each notional route is calculated by deducting from the freight income for such route ship broker commissions equal to of the freight income  commercial management fees equal to of the freight income  the port charges and bunker costs equal to the bunkers used multiplied by the bunkers prices specified below for each vessel 
bunkers used are determined based on speed  distance and consumption of bunkers at sea and in port 
calculation of voyage duration 
the voyage duration for each notional route is calculated using the distance  speed and time in port specified below for each vessel 
data used in calculations 
the following data is used by the charterer in the above calculations bunkers in port 
for product tankers tons per voyage all inclusive loading and discharging ports 
for panamax tankers tons per port call all inclusive loading and discharging ports 
for v max tankers loading tons per day  idling tons per day  discharging tons per day 
bunker prices 
for product tankers and panamax tankers the mean of the average prices during the quarter for marine fuel oil grade ifo cst prevailing at houston  new york and curacao as published by platts bunkerwire  or similar publication  plus barge delivery charges in amount equal to the average barge delivery charges in the applicable port over the prior twelve month period 

table of contents for v max tankers the mean of the average prices during the quarter for marine fuel oil grade ifo cst prevailing at curacao and fujairah as published by platts bunkerwire  or similar publication  plus barge delivery charges in amount equal to the average barge delivery charges in the applicable port over the prior twelve month period 
port charges 
the port charges for loading and discharging ports on each notional route are equal to the published tariffs and exchange rates in effect on the last calendar day of the quarter and include all vessel costs for port calls 
time in port 
for product tankers and panamax tankers days  which are split days loading  days discharging and the balance of the time idling 
for v max tankers days  which are split days loading  days discharging and the balance of the time idling 
distance 
the distance for each notional route is determined according to the world wide marine distance tables published by veson nautical distance tables 
speed and consumption at sea 
for product tankers knots at tons per day in laden condition and knots at tons per day in ballast condition less a steaming allowance of percent applied to the speeds to allow for weather and navigation 
for panamax tankers knots at tons per day in laden condition and knots at tons per day in ballast condition less a steaming allowance of percent applied to the speeds to allow for weather and navigation 
fuel consumption for cargo heating to be actual figures of fuel consumed but not to exceed tons per day 
for v max tankers knots at tons per day in laden condition and knots at tons per day in ballast condition less a steaming allowance of percent applied to the speeds to allow for weather and navigation 
the notional routes are intended to represent routes on which product tankers  panamax tankers and vlccs are typically used 
if during the term of the charter  in the charterer s reasonable opinion  these routes cease to be used by product tankers  panamax tankers or vlccs  or the assumptions regarding bunkering ports for purposes of determining bunker prices cease to be applicable  the charterer may  with our consent  which we may not unreasonably withhold  instruct the brokers panel to substitute alternative notional routes and bunkering ports that most closely match the routes and bunkering ports typically used by product tankers  panamax tankers or vlccs and to apply appropriate weights to such routes 
if in the charterer s reasonable opinion it becomes impractical or dangerous  due to war  hostilities  warlike operations  civil war  civil commotion  revolution or terrorism for product tankers  panamax tankers and vlccs to operate on the notional routes  the charterer may request our agreement  which we may not 
table of contents unreasonably refuse  for the daily value to be determined during the period of such danger or restriction of trading using average spot rates determined by the brokers panel for alternative notional routes proposed by the charterer that reasonably reflect realistic alternative round voyage trade for product tankers  panamax tankers and vlccs during the period of such danger or restriction of trading 
in such event  the time charter equivalent hire will be calculated using the daily value for such alternative routes and applying such weights as determined by the charterer

this period is the first for which the charter has the option to extend the charters if either one of the charter exercises the option described in footnote above 
we have also agreed to pay to northern marine an incentive fee for each day a vessel is on hire for over days during any twelve month period following the date the applicable vessel was delivered to us in amount equal to the basic hire for such vessel 
if we terminate our ship management agreements with northern marine because northern marine has failed to perform its obligations under such agreements  stena has agreed to provide a replacement ship manager to perform the obligations set forth in our ship management agreements on the same terms and for the same fixed amounts payable to northern marine 
northern marine provides technical and crewing management and payroll and support sources to the stena sphere shipping divisions 
other clients include chevrontexaco corporation  technip offshore uk and gulf marine management 
risk of loss and insurance our operations may be affected by a number of risks  including mechanical failure of our vessels  collisions  property loss to the vessels  cargo loss or damage and business interruption due to political circumstances in foreign countries  hostilities and labor strikes 
in addition  the operation of any ocean going vessel is subject to the inherent possibility of catastrophic marine disaster  including oil spills and other environmental mishaps  and the liabilities arising from owning and operating vessels in international trade 
northern marine is responsible for arranging for the insurance of our vessels on terms specified in the ship management agreements and our secured term loan facility  which we believe are in line with standard industry practice 
in accordance with the ship management agreements  northern marine has procured marine hull and machinery and war risks insurance  which includes the risk of actual or constructive total loss  and protection and indemnity insurance with mutual assurance associations 
in accordance with the ship management agreements  northern marine has also obtained off hire insurance in respect of each of our vessels 
currently  the amount of coverage for liability for pollution  spillage and leakage available to us on commercially reasonable terms through protection and indemnity associations and providers of excess coverage is billion per vessel per occurrence 
protection and indemnity associations are mutual marine indemnity associations formed by shipowners to provide protection from large financial loss to one member by contribution towards that loss by all members 

table of contents we believe that our current insurance coverage is adequate to protect us against the accident related risks involved in the conduct of our business and that we currently maintain appropriate levels of environmental damage and pollution insurance coverage  consistent with standard industry practice 
however  there is no assurance that all risks are adequately insured against  that any particular claims will be paid or that we will be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates in the future following termination of the ship management agreements 
inspection by a classification society every commercial vessel s hull and machinery is evaluated by a classification society authorized by its country of registry 
all of our tankers have been certified as being in class by the american bureau of shipping 
the american bureau of shipping is a recognized member of the international association of classification societies and has been recognized by bermuda as an authorized classification society 
the classification society certifies that the vessel has been built and maintained in accordance with the rules of the classification society and complies with applicable rules and regulations of the vessel s country of registry and the international conventions of which that country is a member 
each vessel is inspected by a surveyor of the classification society in three surveys of varying frequency and thoroughness every year for the annual survey  every two to three years for intermediate surveys and every four to five years for special surveys 
should any defects be found  the classification surveyor will issue a recommendation for appropriate repairs which have to be made by the shipowner within the time limit prescribed 
vessels may be required  as part of the annual and intermediate survey process  to be drydocked for inspection of the underwater portions of the vessel and for necessary repair stemming from the inspection 
special surveys always require drydocking 
tanker industry overview overview the tanker industry provides seaborne transportation for the movement of crude oil and refined petroleum products  which include among others naphtha  gasoline  jet fuel  kerosene  gasoil and residual fuel oil 
the tanker business can be divided between crude oil carriers and refined product carriers  although many tanker owners participate in both segments 
the price for transporting crude oil or refined petroleum products for one voyage on a specific route is referred to as tanker spot market freight rate 
tanker types the tanker fleet is divided into several categories of vessels  based on their carrying capacity as defined by the vessels deadweight capacity  which is commonly referred to as dwt 
the different tanker types as classified by their deadweight capacity are ulccs tankers over  dwt  vlccs tankers from  to  dwt  suezmax tankers tankers from  to  dwt  aframax lr tankers uncoated coated tankers from  to  dwt  panamax lr tankers uncoated coated tankers from  to  dwt  handy product tankers mr tankers normally coated tankers from  to  dwt  and small tankers normally coated tankers up to  dwt 
crude carriers are either uncoated or partially coated to protect the cargo tanks from the corrosive properties of crude or dirty products  such as residual fuel oils 
coated tankers are those vessels whose cargo carrying tanks are coated to protect the integrity of the cargo that the vessel is carrying 
coated vessels are utilized in the transportation of clean products such as gasoline  jet fuel and gas oil 

table of contents industry conditions freight rates are set in highly competitive and often volatile markets  where the daily balance of demand and supply for particular vessel types is a primary driver 
the oil tanker industry historically has been highly cyclical  experiencing volatility in spot market freight rates  time charter rates and vessel values  resulting from changes in the supply of and the demand for oil and tanker capacity 
the demand for tankers is influenced by  among other factors  global and regional economic conditions  changes in seaborne transportation patterns  weather patterns and events  oil production  armed conflicts  port congestion  canal closures  embargoes and strikes 
demand for the seaborne carriage of oil depends largely on the distance between areas that produce crude oil and refined products and areas that consume them 
the incremental supply of tanker capacity is a function of the delivery of new vessels and the number of older vessels scrapped  in lay up  converted to other uses  reactivated or lost 
this supply may be affected by regulation of maritime transportation by governmental and international authorities 
these factors are generally outside of our control  and are unpredictable 
tanker demand the volume of crude oil and refined petroleum products transported and the relative distances over which they are transported determines demand for tankers 
tanker demand is generally expressed in ton miles and is measured as the product of the volume of oil carried measured in metric tons multiplied by the distance over which it is carried measured in miles 
tanker demand is determined largely by the state of the world economy and the global demand for crude oil and refined petroleum products 
other factors affecting tanker demand include relative levels of inventories of crude oil and refined petroleum products  political events  conflicts between nations and unexpected variations in weather 
when consuming areas of the world are unable to meet their domestic demand needs  the incremental supply is generally satisfied by increased imports which are typically delivered by tankers 
global oil demand according to the international energy agency  or iea  in  world oil demand increased by million barrels per day  or  to million barrels per day 
between and global oil demand increased by approximately million barrels per day  or 
the iea has forecast world oil demand in to grow by million barrels per day or 
the increases in oil demand have been primarily driven by demand growth in the united states and asia 
these major areas of the world are both net importers of crude oil and refined products  and consequently the tanker industry and tanker demand benefited significantly from this increase in oil demand 
seasonality historically  oil transportation freight rates increase in the winter months and ease in the summer months 
generally the demand for oil in the northern hemisphere rises in colder weather and falls in warmer weather 
additionally  due to the long distances of ocean transportation and delivery time concerns  oil traders typically require oil transportation in advance of the peak consumer demand for certain types of oil cargoes 
tanker supply the supply and availability of tankers  measured in deadweight tons  is affected by several factors including the age profile of the global fleet 
older  single hull vessels face a mandatory phase out age as contained in international conventions 
our fleet consists of modern  double hulled vessels 
the supply of tankers is also affected by the delivery schedule of newbuildings and by the number of vessels removed through scrapping  conversions to other types of employment such as floating production and storage facilities  and unforeseen events such as seaborne casualties 
newbuilding activity is highly correlated to increases and decreases in charter rates  but the delivery schedule is constrained by shipyard capacity and the strength of orders from other marine transportation segments 

table of contents tanker fleet and newbuildings according to clarksons research services ltd  as of december  vlccs the large tanker fleet which includes ulccs consisted of tankers totaling million dwt

tanker scrapping tanker owners may conclude that it is more economical to dispose of or scrap a vessel that has exhausted its useful life rather than continue to maintain or upgrade the vessel in accordance with international standards and rules monitored by the classification societies 
generally when tankers reach an age of approximately years  the costs of conducting the required surveys of the vessel and performing associated repairs may not be economical  particularly if the repairs require replacement of steel plate 
there are international regulations that currently call for the mandatory and accelerated scrapping or disposal of vessels in certain parts of the world 
tanker values tanker values have historically experienced high volatility 
the fair market value of tankers can be expected to fluctuate during their life 
factors that may determine vessel values may be  among other things  the general economic and market conditions affecting the tanker industry  especially the spot voyage freight market  and the age  type  and the general maintenance condition of a vessel 
as vessels age they typically will decline in value 
we believe that the current market value of our tanker fleet is at a very high level 
environmental regulation government regulation significantly affects the ownership and operation of our tankers 
they are subject to international conventions  as well as national  state and local laws and regulations in force in the countries where our tankers operate or are registered 
under our ship management agreements  northern marine has assumed technical management responsibility for our fleet  including compliance with all environmental regulations 
if northern marine fails to perform its obligations under the ship management agreements  we could be liable under environmental laws 
if our ship management agreements with northern marine terminate  we would attempt to hire another party to assume this responsibility  including compliance with the regulations described in this report and any costs associated with such compliance 
however  we may be unable to hire another party to perform these and other services for a fixed fee as is the case with northern marine 
a variety of governmental and private entities subject our tankers to both scheduled and unscheduled inspections 
these entities include the local port authorities  such as the us coast guard  harbor master or equivalent  classification societies  flag state administration and charterers  particularly terminal operators and oil companies 
certain of these entities require us to obtain permits  licenses and certificates for the operation of our tankers 
failure to maintain necessary permits or approvals could require us to incur substantial costs or temporarily suspend operation of one or more of our tankers 
we believe that the heightened level of environmental and quality concerns among insurance underwriters  regulators and charterers is leading to greater inspection and safety requirements on all tankers and may 
table of contents accelerate the scrapping of older tankers throughout the industry 
increasing environmental concerns have created a demand for tankers that conform to the stricter environmental standards 
our two v max tankers were built in and our six other tankers were completed in and northern marine is required to maintain operating standards for all of our tankers which address operational safety  quality of maintenance  training of our officers and crews and compliance with us and international regulations 
we believe that the operation of our vessels is in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations 
however  because such laws and regulations are frequently changed and may impose increasingly strict requirements  we cannot predict the ultimate cost of complying with these requirements  or the impact of these requirements on the resale value or useful lives of our tankers 
international maritime organization in  the international maritime organization adopted regulations that set forth pollution prevention requirements applicable to tankers 
the international maritime organization  commonly referred to as the imo  is the united nations agency for maritime safety and the prevention of marine pollution by ships 
the imo s regulations  which have been adopted by over nations  including many of the jurisdictions in which our tankers operate  provide  in part  that tankers between and years old must be of double hull construction or of a mid deck design with double sided construction  unless they have wing tanks or double bottom spaces not used for the carriage of oil  which cover at least of the length of the cargo tank section of the hull or bottom  or they are capable of hydrostatically balanced loading loading less cargo into a tanker so that in the event of a breach of the hull  water flows into the tanker  displacing oil upwards instead of into the sea  tankers years old or older must be of double hull construction or mid deck design with double sided construction  and all tankers are subject to enhanced inspections 
also  under imo regulations  a tanker must be of double hull construction or a mid deck design with double sided construction or be of another approved design ensuring the same level of protection against oil pollution if the tanker is the subject of a contract for a major conversion or original construction on or after july   commences a major conversion or has its keel laid on or after january   or completes a major conversion or is a newbuilding delivered on or after july  all of our vessels are double hulled 
the imo has also negotiated international conventions that impose liability for oil pollution in international waters and a signatory s territorial waters 
in september  the imo adopted annex vi to the international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships to address air pollution from ships 
annex vi became effective in may annex vi limits sulfur oxide and nitrogen oxide emissions from ship exhausts  prohibits deliberate emissions of ozone depleting substances  such as chlorofluorocarbons  and prohibits onboard incineration of certain materials  such as contaminated packaging or polychlorinated biphenyls 
annex vi includes a global cap on the sulfur content of fuel oil and allows for special areas to be established with more stringent controls on sulfur emissions 
all of our vessels are currently compliant with these regulations 
additional or new conventions  laws and regulations may be adopted that could adversely affect northern marine s ability to manage our ships 
under the international safety management code  or ism code  promulgated by the imo  the party with operational control of a vessel is required to develop an extensive safety management system that includes  among other things  the adoption of a safety and environmental protection policy setting forth 
table of contents instructions and procedures for operating its vessels safely and describing procedures for responding to emergencies 
northern marine relies upon its safety management system in connection with its management of our vessels 
the ism code requires that vessel operators obtain a safety management certificate for each vessel they operate 
this certificate evidences compliance by a vessel s management with code requirements for a safety management system 
no vessel can obtain a certificate unless its operator has been awarded a document of compliance  issued by each flag state  under the ism code 
northern marine has the requisite documents of compliance for its offices and safety management certificates for all of our vessels for which the certificates are required by the imo 
northern marine will be required to renew these documents of compliance and safety management certificates annually 
noncompliance with the ism code and other imo regulations may subject the shipowner or bareboat charterer to increased liability  may lead to decreases in available insurance coverage for affected vessels and may result in the denial of access to  or detention in  some ports 
for example  the us coast guard and european union authorities have indicated that vessels not in compliance with the ism code will be prohibited from trading in us and european union ports 
although the united states is not a party to these conventions  many countries have ratified and follow the liability plan adopted by the imo and set out in the international convention on civil liability for oil pollution damage of under this convention and  depending on whether the country in which the damage results is a party to the protocol to the international convention on civil liability for oil pollution damage  a vessel s registered owner is strictly liable for pollution damage caused in the territorial waters of a contracting state by discharge of persistent oil  subject to certain complete defenses 
under an amendment to the protocol that became effective on november   for vessels of  to  gross tons a unit of measurement for the total enclosed spaces within a vessel  liability is limited to approximately million plus for each additional gross ton over  for vessels of over  gross tons  liability is limited to approximately million 
as the convention calculates liability in terms of a basket of currencies  these figures are based on currency exchange rates on february  under the convention  the right to limit liability is forfeited where the spill is caused by the owner s actual fault 
under the protocol  a shipowner cannot limit liability where the spill is caused by the owner s intentional or reckless conduct 
vessels trading to states that are parties to these conventions must provide evidence of insurance covering the liability of the owner 
in jurisdictions where the international convention on civil liability for oil pollution damage has not been adopted  various legislative schemes or common law govern  and liability is imposed either on the basis of fault or in a manner similar to that convention 
we believe that our protection and indemnity insurance covers the liability under the plan adopted by the imo 
us oil pollution act of and comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act the united states regulates the tanker industry with an extensive regulatory and liability regime for environmental protection and cleanup of oil spills  consisting primarily of the us oil pollution act of  or opa  and the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act  or cercla 
opa affects all owners and operators whose vessels trade with the united states or its territories or possessions  or whose vessels operate in the waters of the united states  which include the us territorial sea and the nautical mile exclusive economic zone around the united states 
cercla applies to the discharge of hazardous substances other than oil whether on land or at sea 
both opa and cercla impact our operations 
under opa  vessel owners  operators and bareboat charterers are responsible parties who are jointly  severally and strictly liable unless the spill results solely from the act or omission of a third party  an act of 
table of contents god or an act of war for all containment and clean up costs and other damages arising from oil spills from their vessels 
these other damages include natural resource damages and related assessment costs  real and personal property damages  net loss of taxes  royalties  rents  profits or earnings capacity  net cost of public services necessitated by a spill response  such as protection from fire  safety or health hazards  and loss of subsistence use of natural resources 
opa limits the liability of responsible parties to the greater of  per gross ton or million per tanker that is over  gross tons  subject to possible adjustment for inflation 
the act specifically permits individual states to impose their own liability regimes with regard to oil pollution incidents occurring within their boundaries  and some states have enacted legislation providing for unlimited liability for discharge of pollutants within their waters 
in some cases  states that have enacted this type of legislation have not yet issued implementing regulations defining tanker owners responsibilities under these laws 
cercla  which applies to owners and operators of vessels  contains a similar liability regime and provides for cleanup  removal and natural resource damages 
liability under cercla is limited to the greater of per gross ton or million 
these limits of liability do not apply  however  where the incident is caused by violation of applicable us federal safety  construction or operating regulations  or by the responsible party s gross negligence or willful misconduct 
these limits do not apply if the responsible party fails or refuses to report the incident or to cooperate and assist in connection with the substance removal activities 
opa and cercla each preserve the right to recover damages under existing law  including maritime tort law 
opa also requires owners and operators of vessels to establish and maintain with the us coast guard evidence of financial responsibility sufficient to meet the limit of their potential strict liability under the act 
the us coast guard has enacted regulations requiring evidence of financial responsibility consistent with the combined maximum limits of liability described above for opa and cercla 
under the regulations  evidence of financial responsibility may be demonstrated by insurance  surety bond  self insurance  guaranty or an alternative method subject to approval by the director of the us coast guard national pollution funds center 
under opa regulations  an owner or operator of more than one tanker is required to demonstrate evidence of financial responsibility for the entire fleet in an amount equal only to the financial responsibility requirement of the tanker having the greatest maximum strict liability under opa and cercla 
northern marine has provided the requisite guarantees and has received certificates of financial responsibility from the us coast guard for each of our tankers required to have one 
northern marine has arranged pollution liability insurance coverage for each of our tankers in the amount of billion per occurrence 
however  a catastrophic spill could exceed the insurance coverage available  in which event there could be a material adverse effect on our business  on the charterers business  which could impair the charterers ability to make payments to us under our charters  and on northern marine s business  which could impair northern marine s ability to manage our vessels 
under opa  oil tankers as to which a contract for construction or major conversion was put in place after june  are required to have double hulls 
in addition  oil tankers without double hulls will not be permitted to come to us ports or trade in us waters by all of our vessels have double hulls 
opa also amended the federal water pollution control act to require that owners or operators of tankers operating in the waters of the united states must file vessel response plans with the us coast guard  and their tankers are required to operate in compliance with their us coast guard approved plans 
these response plans must  among other things address a worst case scenario and identify and ensure  through contract or other approved means  the availability of necessary private response resources to respond to a worst case discharge  
table of contents describe crew training and drills  and identify a qualified individual with full authority to implement removal actions 
vessel response plans for our tankers operating in the waters of the united states have been approved by the us coast guard 
in addition  the us coast guard has announced it intends to propose similar regulations requiring certain vessels to prepare response plans for the release of hazardous substances 
northern marine is responsible for ensuring that our vessels comply with any additional regulations 
opa does not prevent individual states from imposing their own liability regimes with respect to oil pollution incidents occurring within their boundaries 
in fact  most us states that border a navigable waterway have enacted environmental pollution laws that impose strict liability on a person for removal costs and damages resulting from a discharge of oil or a release of a hazardous substance 
these laws may be more stringent than us federal law 
european union tanker restrictions in july  in response to the mt prestige oil spill in november  the european union adopted legislation that prohibits all single hull tankers used for the transport of oil from entering into its ports or offshore terminals by the european union  following the lead of certain european union nations such as italy and spain  has also banned all single hull tankers carrying heavy grades of oil from entering or leaving its ports or offshore terminals or anchoring in areas under its jurisdiction 
commencing in  certain single hull tankers above years of age also became restricted from entering or leaving european union ports or offshore terminals and anchoring in areas under european union jurisdiction 
the european union is also considering legislation that would ban manifestly sub standard vessels defined as those over years old that have been detained by port authorities at least twice in a six month period from european waters and create an obligation of port states to inspect vessels posing a high risk to maritime safety or the marine environment  and provide the european union with greater authority and control over classification societies  including the ability to seek to suspend or revoke the authority of negligent societies 
it is impossible to predict what legislation or additional regulations  if any  may be promulgated by the european union or any other country or authority 
vessel security regulations since the terrorist attacks of september   there have been a variety of initiatives intended to enhance vessel security 
on november   the maritime transportation security act of  or mtsa  came into effect 
to implement certain portions of the mtsa  in july  the us coast guard issued regulations requiring the implementation of certain security requirements aboard vessels operating in waters subject to the jurisdiction of the united states 
similarly  in december  amendments to the international convention for the safety of life at sea  or solas  created a new chapter of the convention dealing specifically with maritime security 
the new chapter became effective in july and imposes various detailed security obligations on vessels and port authorities  most of which are contained in the newly created international ship and port facilities security code  or isps code 
the isps code is designed to protect ports and international shipping against terrorism 
after july   to trade internationally  a vessel must attain an international ship security certificate from a recognized security organization approved by the vessels flag state 
among the various requirements are on board installation of automatic identification systems  or ais  to provide a means for the automatic transmission of safety related information from among similarly equipped ships and shore stations  including information on a ship s identity  position  course  speed and navigational status  on board installation of ship security alert systems  which do not sound on the vessel but only alerts the authorities on shore  the development of vessel security plans  ship identification number to be permanently marked on a vessel s hull  
table of contents a continuous synopsis record kept onboard showing a vessel s history including  name of the ship and of the state whose flag the ship is entitled to fly  the date on which the ship was registered with that state  the ship s identification number  the port at which the ship is registered and the name of the registered owners and their registered addresses  and compliance with flag state security certification requirements 
the us coast guard regulations  intended to align with international maritime security standards  exempt non us tankers from mtsa vessel security measures provided such vessels have on board  by july   a valid international ship security certificate that attests to the vessel s compliance with solas security requirements and the isps code 
northern marine has implemented the various security measures addressed by the mtsa  solas and the isps code and all of our tankers are in compliance with these applicable security requirements

risk factors the following important factors  among others  could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward looking statements made in this report or presented elsewhere by management from time to time 
company specific risk factors we cannot assure you that we will pay any dividends we intend to pay dividends on a quarterly basis in amounts determined by our board of directors 
we believe our dividends will be substantially equal to the charterhire received by us under the charters  less cash expenses and any cash reserves established by our board of directors 
such expenses consist primarily of fees under our ship management agreements  directors fees  salaries and benefits of our president and co chief executive officer and our co chief executive officer and chief financial officer  payment of interest under our credit facility  and other administrative costs and other expenses 
there can be no assurance that we will not have other cash expenses  including extraordinary expenses  which could include the costs of claims and related litigation expenses 
there can be no assurance that we will not have additional expenses or liabilities  that the amounts currently anticipated for the items set forth above will not increase  that we will not have to fund any required capital expenditures for our vessels or that our board of directors will not determine to establish additional cash reserves or change our dividend policy 
other than the fees under our ship management agreements  none of our fees or expenses is fixed 
the amount of potential future dividends set forth in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dividend policy represents only an estimate of future dividends based on our charter contracts  ship management agreements  an estimate of our other expenses and the other matters and assumptions set forth therein and assumes that other than our ship management expenses  none of our expenses increase during the periods presented in the table 
the amount of future dividends  if any  could be affected by various factors  including the loss of a vessel  required capital expenditures  cash reserves established by our board of directors  increased or unanticipated expenses  a change in our dividend policy  increased borrowings or future issuances of securities  many of which are beyond our control 
as a result  the amount of dividends actually paid may vary from period to period and such variations may be material 
our secured term loan facility also provides that we may not pay dividends if an event of default under the facility agreement has occurred and continues or if the market value of our vessels is less than of our borrowings under the facility or  if at the time of the proposed dividend  all of our vessels are on time charter for a remaining period of months  less than of the loan amount 
the declaration of dividends is subject to these covenants of our loan facility  compliance with bermuda law and is subject at all times to the discretion of our board of directors 
there can be no assurance that dividends will be paid in the amounts anticipated or at all 
we are highly dependent on the charterers and their guarantors  stena and concordia all of our vessels are chartered to subsidiaries of concordia and a subsidiary of stena  which we refer to collectively as the charterers 
the charterers payments to us under these charters  which we refer to as the charters  are our sole source of revenue 
we are highly dependent on the performance by the charterers of their obligations under the charters and by their guarantors  stena and concordia  of their obligations under their respective guarantees 
any failure by the charterers or the guarantors to perform their obligations would materially and adversely affect our business and financial position 
our shareholders do not have any recourse against the charterers or the guarantors 

table of contents if we cannot refinance our loans  or in the event of a default under our secured term loan facility  we may have to sell our vessels  which may leave no additional funds for distributions to shareholders under the terms of the loan agreement providing for our secured term loan facility  we are required to repay the total amount outstanding at maturity  january  borrowings under the facility are guaranteed by each of our vessel owning subsidiaries and are secured by mortgages over all of our vessels  assignments of earnings  insurances and requisition compensation with respect to our vessels  and assignments of our interests in the charters and our ship management agreements 
whether or not the charterers renew the charters  the loan agreement will mature in january and we will be obligated to repay or refinance the total amount due under the loan at that time 
there is no assurance that we will be able to repay or refinance this amount 
in addition  even if the charterers renew the charters for one or more of our vessels  if we are unable to refinance our credit facility on acceptable terms  we may be forced to attempt to sell our vessels 
if interest rates are higher than current rates at the time we seek to refinance our credit facility  such higher rates could prevent our ability to complete a refinancing or could adversely impact our future results  including the amount of cash available for future dividends 
in such event  we may conclude that such a refinancing is not on acceptable terms 
in addition  in the event of a default under our credit facility all of our vessels could be sold to satisfy amounts due to the lenders under our credit facility 
depending on the market value for our vessels at the time  it is possible that after payment of the amounts outstanding under our credit facility there would not be any funds to distribute to our shareholders 
in addition  under our bye laws  any sale of a vessel would require the approval of at least a majority of our shareholders voting at a meeting 
because we intend to distribute dividends to our shareholders in an amount substantially equal to our charterhire  less cash expenses and any cash reserves established by our board of directors  we do not believe we will be able to repay our credit facility at the end of five years without selling some or all of our vessels 
as a result  we believe we will be required to refinance the borrowing under our credit facility at or prior to its maturity 
we may not be able to recharter our vessels profitably after they expire  unless they are extended at the option of the charterers our charters have fixed terms with between three and five years remaining 
the charterers also have options to extend the terms of their charters 
each of the charterers has the sole discretion to exercise that option 
we cannot predict whether the charterers will exercise any of their extension options under one or more of the charters 
the charterers will not owe any fiduciary or other duty to us or our shareholders in deciding whether to exercise the extension option  and the charterers decision may be contrary to our interests or those of our shareholders 
we cannot predict at this time any of the factors that the charterers will consider in deciding whether to exercise any of their extension options under the charters 
it is likely  however  that the charterers would consider a variety of factors  which may include the age and specifications of the particular vessel  whether a vessel is surplus or suitable to the charterers requirements and whether competitive charterhire rates are available to the charterers in the open market at that time 
if the charterers decide not to extend our current charters  we may not be able to re charter our vessels with terms similar to the terms of our charters 
we may also employ the vessels on the spot charter market  which is subject to greater rate fluctuation than the time charter market 
under our ship management agreements  northern marine management ltd  a wholly owned subsidiary of stena  which we refer to as northern marine  is responsible for all of the technical and operational management of our vessels for a fixed management fee  increasing annually 
northern marine has also agreed to indemnify us against specified off hire and reduced hire for our vessels that exceeds five days per year 
however  this indemnity only extends to the amount payable to us as basic hire and would not extend to any amounts that would otherwise be payable to us as additional hire if the vessels were not off hire 
our ship management agreements with northern marine may be terminated by either party if the relevant charter is terminated or expires 
if our ship management agreements with northern marine were to terminate  we may 
table of contents not be able to obtain similar fixed rate terms or indemnification for off hire and reduced hire periods from another ship manager 
if we receive lower charter rates under replacement charters  are unable to recharter all of our vessels or we incur greater expenses under replacement management agreements  the amounts available  if any  to pay distributions to our shareholders may be significantly reduced or eliminated 
under our charters  there is no obligation to pay additional hire during any period when the obligation to pay basic hire is suspended under the charter if due to technical reasons the vessel is off hire  unless the vessel is off hire as a result of a class condition or recommendation determined by the vessel s classification society during the inspection of the vessel undertaken by us in connection with the purchase of the vessel and such condition or recommendation cannot be remedied or complied with during a regularly scheduled drydocking without increasing the duration of such drydocking 
concordia and stena are able to influence the company  including the outcome of shareholder votes concordia and stena directly and indirectly owned an aggregate of approximately of our outstanding common shares as of february  as a result of their share ownership and for so long as either concordia or stena directly or indirectly owns a significant percentage of our outstanding common shares  concordia and stena are able to influence the company  including the outcome of any shareholder vote  such as the election of directors 
we are leveraged and subject to restrictions in our financing agreements that impose constraints on our operating and financing flexibility we have a secured term loan facility under which we have borrowed million  of which million was outstanding as of december  and the remaining million was drawn down as of january  to finance a portion of the cash purchase price for our vessels 
we are required to apply a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of interest on borrowings under the facility 
our facility  which is secured by  among other things  mortgages on our vessels  pledges of our time charters and assignments of earnings  insurances and requisition compensation in respect to our vessels  requires that we comply with various operating covenants and maintain certain financial ratios including that the market value of our vessels exceeds of the total facility amount outstanding and that the market value of our vessels exceeds of our borrowings or if the loan amount at the time of such dividend all of our vessels are on time charter for a remaining period of at least months in order for us to pay dividends 
the facility also requires that northern marine remain as technical manager for our vessels 
we have a floating rate of interest under our secured term loan facility 
however  we have entered into an interest rate swap agreement that effectively fixes the interest rate at per year through maturity of the facility in january by utilizing this interest rate swap  we potentially forego benefits that might result from declines in interest rates 
we are a holding company  and we depend on the ability of our subsidiaries to distribute funds to us in order to satisfy our financial and other obligations we are a holding company  and have no significant assets other than the equity interests in our subsidiaries 
our subsidiaries own all of our vessels  and payments under our charters are made to our subsidiaries 
as a result  our ability to pay dividends depends on the performance of our subsidiaries and their ability to distribute funds to us 
the ability of a subsidiary to make these distributions could be affected by a claim or other action by a third party  including a creditor  or by bermuda law which regulates the payment of dividends by companies 
if we are unable to obtain funds from our subsidiaries  we will not be able to pay dividends unless we obtain funds from other sources 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain funds from other sources 

table of contents us tax authorities could treat us as a passive foreign investment company  which could have adverse us federal income tax consequences to us shareholders a foreign corporation will be treated as a passive foreign investment company  or pfic  for us federal income tax purposes if either at least of its gross income for any taxable year consists of certain types of passive income or at least of the average value of the corporation s assets produce or are held for the production of those types of passive income 
for purposes of these tests  passive income includes dividends  interest  and gains from the sale or exchange of investment property and rents and royalties other than rents and royalties which are received from unrelated parties in connection with the active conduct of a trade or business 
for purposes of these tests  income derived from the performance of services does not constitute passive income 
us shareholders of a pfic are subject to a disadvantageous us federal income tax regime with respect to the income derived by the pfic  the distributions they receive from the pfic and the gain  if any  they derive from the sale or other disposition of their shares in the pfic 
based on our method of operation  we do not believe that we were a pfic for our most recent taxable year or that we will become a pfic with respect to any future taxable year 
in this regard  we treat the gross income we derive or are deemed to derive from our time chartering activities as services income  rather than rental income 
accordingly  we believe that our income from our time chartering activities does not constitute passive income  and the assets that we own and operate in connection with the production of that income do not constitute passive assets 
there is  however  no direct legal authority under the pfic rules addressing our method of operation 
accordingly  no assurance can be given that the us internal revenue service  or irs  or a court of law will accept our position  and there is a risk that the irs or a court of law could determine that we are a pfic 
moreover  no assurance can be given that we would not constitute a pfic for any future taxable year if there were to be changes in the nature and extent of our operations 
if the irs were to find that we are or have been a pfic for any taxable year  our us shareholders would face adverse us tax consequences 
under the pfic rules  unless those shareholders make an election available under the internal revenue code of  as amended  such shareholders would be liable to pay us federal income tax at the then prevailing income tax rates on ordinary income plus interest upon certain distributions and upon any gain from the disposition of our common shares  as if the distribution or gain had been recognized ratably over the shareholder s holding period of our common shares 
in addition  a step up in the tax basis of our shares may not be available upon the death of an individual shareholder  and the preferential us federal income tax rates currently applicable to qualified dividend income of certain us investors would not apply 
our operating income could fail to qualify for an exemption from us federal income taxation  which will reduce our cash flow unless exempt from us federal income taxation  a foreign corporation is subject to us federal income taxation at a rate of on its us source shipping income  including of its shipping income that is attributable to transportation that begins or ends in the united states 
shipping income will be exempt from us federal income taxation if  with respect to each specified category of shipping income  including time chartering income the foreign corporation generating the income is organized in a foreign country that grants an equivalent exemption to us corporations and either a our common shares are primarily and regularly traded on an established securities market  as determined under complex applicable us treasury regulations  in that same foreign country  in the united states or in another country that grants an equivalent exemption to us corporations or b more than of the value of our shares is treated as owned  directly or indirectly  for at least half of the number of days in the taxable year by one or more qualified shareholders  as defined under applicable us treasury regulations 
bermuda  our country of organization  is a foreign country that grants an equivalent exemption to us corporations with respect to time chartering income 
in addition  our common shares are currently primarily and regularly traded on the new york stock exchange  which is an established securities market in the united states 
therefore  we believe that our time chartering income qualifies for the exemption from 
table of contents us federal income taxation 
our qualification for the exemption  however  is based upon certain complex factual determinations that are not completely within our control and  therefore  there can be no assurance that we will qualify for the exemption either now or in the future 
if we were not to qualify for the exemption  our cash available for distributions to shareholders would be correspondingly reduced 
us investors who own our common shares may have more difficulty in protecting their interests than us investors who own shares of a delaware corporation the companies act of bermuda  which applies to us  differs in certain material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and their shareholders 
set forth below is a summary of certain significant provisions of the companies act which differ in certain respects from provisions of delaware corporate law 
because the following statements are summaries  they do not discuss all aspects of bermuda law that may be relevant to us and our shareholders 
interested directors 
bermuda law and our bye laws provide that if a director has an interest in a material contract or proposed material contract with us or any of our subsidiaries or has a material interest in any person that is a party to such a contract  the director must disclose the nature of that interest at the first opportunity either at a meeting of directors or in writing to the directors 
our bye laws provide that  after a director has made such a declaration of interest  he is allowed to be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present and to vote on a transaction in which he has an interest  unless disqualified from doing so by the chairman of the relevant board meeting 
under delaware law such transaction would not be voidable if the material facts as to such interested director s relationship or interests were disclosed or were known to the board of directors and the board had in good faith authorized the transaction by the affirmative vote of a majority of the disinterested directors  such material facts were disclosed or were known to the stockholders entitled to vote on such transaction and the transaction was specifically approved in good faith by vote of the majority of shares entitled to vote thereon  or the transaction was fair as to the corporation as of the time it was authorized  approved or ratified 
under delaware law  the interested director could be held liable for a transaction in which the director derived an improper personal benefit 
shareholders suits 
class actions and derivative actions are generally not available to shareholders under bermuda law 
the bermuda courts  however  would ordinarily be expected to permit a shareholder to commence an action in the name of a company to remedy a wrong to the company where the act complained of is alleged to be beyond the corporate power of the company or illegal  or would result in the violation of the company s memorandum of association or bye laws 
furthermore  consideration would be given by a bermuda court to acts that are alleged to constitute a fraud against the minority shareholders or  for instance  where an act requires the approval of a greater percentage of the company s shareholders than that which actually approved it 
when the affairs of a company are being conducted in a manner which is oppressive or prejudicial to the interests of some part of the shareholders  one or more shareholders may apply to the supreme court of bermuda  which may make such order as it sees fit  including an order regulating the conduct of the company s affairs in the future or ordering the purchase of the shares of any shareholders by other shareholders or by the company 
our bye laws contain a provision by virtue of which our shareholders waive any claim or right of action that they have  both individually and on our behalf  against any director or officer in relation to any action or failure to take action by such director or officer  except in respect of any fraud or dishonesty of such director or officer 
class actions and derivative actions generally are available to stockholders under delaware law for  among other things  breach of fiduciary duty  corporate waste and actions not taken in accordance with 
table of contents applicable law 
in such actions  the court has discretion to permit the winning party to recover attorneys fees incurred in connection with such action 
indemnification of directors 
section of the companies act provides generally that a bermuda company may indemnify its directors  officers and auditors against any liability which by virtue of any rule of law would otherwise be imposed on them in respect of any negligence  default  breach of duty or breach of trust  except in cases where such liability arises from fraud or dishonesty of which such director  officer or auditor may be guilty in relation to the company 
section further provides that a bermuda company may indemnify its directors  officers and auditors against any liability incurred by them in defending any proceedings  whether civil or criminal  in which judgment is awarded in their favor or in which they are acquitted or granted relief by the supreme court of bermuda pursuant to section of the companies act 
we have adopted provisions in our bye laws that provide that we shall indemnify our officers and directors in respect of their actions and omissions  except in respect of their fraud or dishonesty 
our bye laws provide that the shareholders waive all claims or rights of action that they might have  individually or in right of the company  against any of the company s directors or officers for any act or failure to act in the performance of such director s or officer s duties  except in respect of any fraud or dishonesty of such director or officer 
section a of the companies act permits us to purchase and maintain insurance for the benefit of any officer or director in respect of any loss or liability attaching to him in respect of any negligence  default  breach of duty or breach of trust  whether or not we may otherwise indemnify such officer or director 
we have purchased and maintain a directors and officers liability policy for such a purpose 
under delaware law  a corporation may indemnify a director or officer of the corporation against expenses including attorneys fees  judgments  fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred in defense of an action  suit or proceeding by reason of such position if such director or officer acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not be opposed to the best interests of the corporation and  with respect to any criminal action or proceeding  such director or officer had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful 
bermuda law and our bye laws permit our board of directors to establish preference shares having terms which could reduce or eliminate dividends payable to our common shareholders bermuda law and our bye laws permit our board of directors to issue preference shares with dividend rates  relative voting rights  conversion or exchange rights  redemption rights  liquidation rights and other relative participation  optional or other special rights  qualifications  limitations or restrictions as may be determined by resolution of the board without shareholder approval 
such preference shares could have terms that provide for the payment of dividends prior to the payment of dividends in respect of the common shares 
as a result  the issuance of these preference shares could reduce or eliminate dividends payable to common shareholders 
our bye laws restrict shareholders from bringing certain legal action against our officers and directors our bye laws contain a broad waiver by our shareholders of any claim or right of action  both individually and on our behalf  against any of our officers or directors 
the waiver applies to any action taken by an officer or director  or the failure of an officer or director to take any action  in the performance of his or her duties  except with respect to any matter involving any fraud or dishonesty on the part of the officer or director 
this waiver limits the right of shareholders to assert claims against our officers and directors unless the act or failure to act involves fraud or dishonesty 

table of contents we have anti takeover provisions in our bye laws that may discourage a change of control our bye laws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors 
these provisions provide for a classified board of directors with staggered three year terms  elected without cumulative voting  directors only to be removed for cause and only with the affirmative vote of holders of at least of the common shares issued and outstanding  advance notice for nominations of directors by shareholders and for shareholders to include matters to be considered at annual meetings  our board of directors to determine the powers  preferences and rights of our preference shares and to issue the preference shares without shareholder approval  and a requirement that amalgamations  sales of assets and certain other transactions with persons owning or more of our voting securities  which we refer to as interested shareholders  be approved by holders of at least of our issued and outstanding voting shares not owned by the interested shareholder  subject to certain exceptions 
these provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if the third party s offer may be considered beneficial by many shareholders 
as a result  shareholders may be limited in their ability to obtain a premium for their shares 
industry specific risk factors the highly cyclical nature of the tanker industry may lead to volatile changes in charter rates and vessel values which may adversely affect our earnings if the tanker industry  which has been highly cyclical  is depressed in the future when our charters expire or at a time when we may want to sell a vessel  our earnings and available cash flow may decrease 
our ability to recharter our vessels on the expiration or termination of the charters and the charter rates that we may receive under any renewal or replacement charters will depend upon  among other things  economic conditions in the tanker market at that time 
fluctuations in charter rates and vessel values result from changes in the supply and demand for tanker capacity and changes in the supply and demand for oil and oil products 
for example  charter rates and vessel values were at a high level during charter rates declined from that high level during the first quarter of  and have subsequently further declined 
there can be no assurance that charter rates and vessel values will not decline from current levels 
our vessels are operated under time charters with the charterers 
we receive a fixed minimum daily base charter rate and may receive additional hire under the charters 
additional hire  if any  is paid quarterly in arrears 
the amount of additional hire is subject to variation depending on the charterhire received by the charterers under time charters  spot charters and on general tanker market conditions 
the amount of additional hire that we may earn is based on a formula for assumed voyage routes and expenses that we agreed to with the charterers 
the payment of additional hire  if any  has no correlation to our potential future time charter equivalent earnings 
if a vessel is off hire  that vessel is not eligible to earn additional hire during the off hire period 
we cannot assure you that we will receive additional hire for any quarter other than in the case of the charters for the v max tankers which are currently sub chartered to sun international until june and september 
table of contents factors beyond our control may adversely affect the value of our vessels the factors affecting the supply and demand for tanker vessels are outside of our control  and the nature  timing and degree of changes in industry conditions are unpredictable and may adversely affect the value of our vessels 
the factors that influence the demand for tanker capacity include demand for oil and oil products  which affect the need for tanker capacity  global and regional economic and political conditions which among other things  could impact the supply of oil as well as trading patterns and the demand for various types of vessels  changes in the production of crude oil  particularly by opec and other key producers  which impact the need for tanker capacity  developments in international trade  changes in seaborne and other transportation patterns  including changes in the distances that cargoes are transported  environmental concerns and regulations  weather  and competition from alternative sources of energy 
the factors that influence the supply of tanker capacity include the number of newbuilding deliveries  the scrapping rate of older vessels  and the number of vessels that are out of service 
an over supply of new vessels may adversely affect charter rates and vessel values if the number of new ships delivered exceeds the number of tankers being scrapped and lost  tanker capacity will increase 
in addition  according to clarkson research studies ltd  the total newbuilding order book for vessels with capacity of  dwt or more scheduled to enter the fleet through currently equals of the existing fleet and we cannot assure you that the order book will not increase further in proportion to the existing fleet 
if the supply of tanker capacity increases and the demand for tanker capacity does not increase correspondingly  charter rates could materially decline and the value of our vessels could be adversely affected 
terrorist attacks and international hostilities can affect the tanker industry  which could adversely affect our business additional attacks like those of september  or longer lasting war or international hostilities  including those currently underway in iraq and the middle east  could damage the world economy  adversely affect the availability of and demand for crude oil and petroleum products and adversely affect our ability to recharter our vessels on the expiration or termination of the charters and the charter rates payable under any renewal or replacement charters 
we conduct our operations outside the united states  and our business  financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by changing economic  political and government conditions in the countries and regions where our vessels are employed 
moreover  we operate in a sector of the economy that is likely to be adversely impacted by the effects of political instability  terrorist or other attacks  war or international hostilities 
the value of our vessels may fluctuate and adversely affect our liquidity and may result in breaches under our credit facility tanker values have generally experienced high volatility 
investors can expect the fair market value of our tankers to fluctuate  depending on general economic and market conditions affecting the tanker industry and 
table of contents competition from other shipping companies  types and sizes of vessels and other modes of transportation 
in addition  although our panamax and product tankers were built in and our v max tankers were built in  as vessels grow older  they generally decline in value 
these factors will affect the value of our vessels at the termination of their charters or earlier at the time of any sale  which during the term of the charters will require the consent of the charterer and the lenders under our credit facility 
borrowings under our term loan agreement bear interest at a floating rate of libor plus a basis points margin  which would increase to basis points if the ratio of the value of our vessels to the amount outstanding under the loan facility falls below the increased interest margin is equivalent to approximately  per year in increased interest costs in the event the ratio falls below in the event of the sale or loss of a vessel  we might be required to repay a percentage of the loan earlier than we planned or increase our payments under the facility  which could affect our financial condition and ability to make payments to our shareholders 
declining tanker values could adversely affect our ability to refinance our credit facility at its maturity in january and thereby adversely impact our business and operations and liquidity 
due to the cyclical nature of the tanker market  if for any reason we sell tankers at a time when tanker prices have fallen  the sale may be at less than the tanker s carrying amount on our financial statements  with the result that we would also incur a loss and a reduction in earnings 
we operate in the highly competitive international tanker market which could affect our position if the charterers do not renew our charters the operation of tanker vessels and transportation of crude oil and petroleum products are extremely competitive 
competition arises primarily from other tanker owners  including major oil companies  as well as independent tanker companies  some of which have substantially larger fleets and substantially greater resources than we do 
competition for the transportation of oil and oil products can be intense and depends on price  location  size  age  condition and the acceptability of the tanker and its operators to the charterers 
during the term of our charters with the charterers we are not exposed to the risk associated with this competition 
however  if the charterers do not exercise their options to renew the charters  we will have to compete with other tanker owners  including major oil companies and independent tanker companies for charterers 
due in part to the fragmented tanker market  competitors with greater resources could enter and operate larger fleets through acquisitions or consolidations and may be able to offer better prices and fleets than us  which could result in our achieving lower revenues from our vessels 
compliance with environmental laws or regulations may adversely affect our business the shipping industry is affected by numerous regulations in the form of international conventions  national  state and local laws and national and international regulations in force in the jurisdictions in which such tankers operate  as well as in the country or countries in which such tankers are registered 
these regulations include the us oil pollution act of  or opa  the international convention on civil liability for oil pollution damage of  international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships  the imo international convention for the safety of life at sea of  or solas  the international convention on load lines of and the us marine transportation security act of in addition  vessel classification societies also impose significant safety and other requirements on our vessels 
we believe our tankers  four of which were built in and two of which were built in  are maintained in compliance with present regulatory and class requirements relevant to areas in which they operate  and are operated in compliance with applicable safety and environmental laws and regulations 
however  regulation of tankers  particularly in the areas of safety and environmental impact  may change in the future and require significant capital expenditures be incurred on our vessels to keep them in compliance 
although the charterers will be responsible for all capital expenditures required due to changes in law  classification society or regulatory requirements in an amount less than  per year per vessel  all other required capital expenditures during the charter period will be split between us and the applicable charterer based on the remaining charter period and the remaining depreciation period of the vessel  which is calculated as years from the year the vessel was built 

table of contents the shipping industry has inherent operational risks  which may not be adequately covered by insurance our tankers and their cargoes are at risk of being damaged or lost because of events such as marine disasters  bad weather  mechanical failures  human error  war  terrorism  piracy and other circumstances or events 
in addition  transporting crude oil across a wide variety of international jurisdictions creates a risk of business interruptions due to political circumstances in foreign countries  hostilities  labor strikes and boycotts  the potential for changes in tax rates or policies  and the potential for government expropriation of our vessels 
any of these events may result in loss of revenues  increased costs and decreased cash flows to the charterer  which could impair its ability to make payments to us under our charters 
in the event of a casualty to a vessel or other catastrophic event  we will rely on our insurance to pay the insured value of the vessel or the damages incurred 
under our ship management agreements  northern marine is responsible for obtaining insurance for our fleet against those risks that we believe the shipping industry commonly insures against 
these insurances include marine hull and machinery insurance  protection and indemnity insurance  which includes pollution risks and crew insurances and war risk insurance 
northern marine has also obtained off hire insurance in respect of each of our vessels 
currently  the amount of coverage for liability for pollution  spillage and leakage available to us on commercially reasonable terms through protection and indemnity associations and providers of excess coverage is billion per vessel per occurrence 
we cannot assure you that we will be adequately insured against all risks 
under the ship management agreements  northern marine performs all technical management  including crewing and providing insurance for a fixed management fee 
however  we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage at reasonable rates for our fleet in the future in the event our existing charters are not renewed at the expiration of their terms 
additionally  our insurers may refuse to pay particular claims 
any significant loss or liability for which we are not insured could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
in addition  the loss of a vessel would adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations 
maritime claimants could arrest our tankers  which could interrupt the charterers or our cash flow crew members  suppliers of goods and services to a vessel  shippers of cargo and other parties may be entitled to a maritime lien against that vessel for unsatisfied debts  claims or damages 
in many jurisdictions  a maritime lien holder may enforce its lien by arresting a vessel through foreclosure proceedings 
the arrest or attachment of one or more of our vessels could interrupt the charterers or our cash flow and require us to pay a significant amount of money to have the arrest lifted 
in addition  in some jurisdictions  such as south africa  under the sister ship theory of liability  a claimant may arrest both the vessel which is subject to the claimant s maritime lien and any associated vessel  which is any vessel owned or controlled by the same owner 
claimants could try to assert sister ship liability against one vessel in our fleet for claims relating to another vessel in our fleet 
governments could requisition our vessels during a period of war or emergency without adequate compensation the government of the united kingdom  the country under which our bermuda flagged vessels would fall  could requisition or seize our vessels 
under requisition for title  a government takes control of a vessel and becomes its owner 
under requisition for hire  a government takes control of a vessel and effectively becomes its charterer at dictated charter rates 
generally  requisitions occur during periods of war or emergency 
although we would be entitled to compensation in the event of a requisition  the amount and timing of payment would be uncertain 
rising or high oil prices may affect demand for oil  and subsequently demand for oil tankers may fall 
crude oil and oil products are commodities that experience price volatility 
prices for these commodities are set in an open market 
we are an independent transporter of cargoes of crude oil and oil products and have no control over the price of the cargoes that we carry 
we depend on circumstances where there are suitable cargoes available for our vessels to transport 
in a rising or high oil price environment  demand for crude oil 
table of contents and oil products may be reduced  which could reduce demand for our tanker vessels 
such a reduction in demand for our tanker vessels could adversely affect our results of operations  possibly materially 
risks related to our common shares if a significant number of our common shares are sold in the market  the market price of our common shares could significantly decline  even if our business is doing well the market price of our common shares could decline due to sales of a large number of shares in the market including sales of shares by our large shareholders  or the perception that these sales could occur 
these sales or the perception that these sales could occur could also make it more difficult or impossible for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate 
concordia  stena and fram shipping ltd  which we refer to as fram  were not eligible to sell their remaining shares until their lock up agreements expired on august  we have entered into registration rights agreements with them that entitle them to have all or a portion of their remaining shares registered for sale in the public market following that lock up period
