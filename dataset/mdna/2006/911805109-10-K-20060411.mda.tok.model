item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is management s discussion and analysis of significant factors  which have affected the company s liquidity  capital resources and results of operations during the calendar years ended december   and the discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
general overview us energy corp 
use or the company and its subsidiaries historically have been involved in the acquisition  exploration  development and production of properties prospective for hard rock minerals including lead  zinc  silver  molybdenum  gold  uranium  and oil and gas 
the company also has been engaged to a limited extent in commercial real estate  but only in connection with acquiring mineral properties which included commercial real estate 
the company manages its operations through a joint venture  usecc joint venture usecc  with one of its subsidiary companies  crested corp 
crested of which it owns a consolidated 
the narrative discussion of this md a refers only to use or the company but includes the consolidated financial statements of crested  plateau resources limited plateau  usecc and other subsidiaries 
the company has entered into partnerships through which it either joint ventured or leased properties with non related parties for the development and production of certain of its mineral properties 
the company had no production from any of its mineral properties during the year ended december  except its coalbed methane business which was sold on june  prior filings for previous periods  including the years ended december  and  included the consolidated financial statements of rocky mountain gas  inc rmg 
on june   all of the outstanding stock of rmg was sold to enterra us acquisitions inc acquisitions  a privately held washington corporation organized by enterra energy trust enterra  for million in cash and securities 
financial statements in this annual report for the years ended december   and therefore do not include the balances of rmg  as all prior reported balances of rmg are eliminated and reported as discontinued operations 
during the years ended december  and  the company s uranium and gold properties were shut down due to depressed metals prices 
during  the market prices for gold and uranium increased to levels which may allow the company to place these properties into production or sell part or all of them to industry participants 
exploration work was resumed on the uranium properties in and new uranium properties have been acquired 
uranium the price of uranium concentrate has increased from a five year low of per pound in january to a five year high of per pound in december during the first quarter of this increase in the market price continued 
gold the five year low for gold was in when it hit per ounce 
the market price for gold has risen since that time to a high of in with an average price for the year of of per ounce 
metal prices 
com 
molybdenum annual metal week dealer oxide mean prices averaged per pound in  compared with per pound in  per pound in and per pound in metal prices 
com 
continued strong demand  which has outpaced supply over the past several years deficit market conditions  has reduced inventory levels throughout the industry 
the rebound in uranium  gold and molybdenum presents an opportunity for the company 
the company holds what we consider to be significant mineral and related properties in gold and uranium  and received a significant molybdenum property from phelps dodge corporation pd on february  in contrast to the prior five years  we now have cash on hand  and reasonably expect to receive more cash during the year ending december  sufficient for general and administrative expenses  the continuation of our uranium property acquisition and exploration plan  and operation of the water treatment plant on the molybdenum property 
management s strategy to generate a return on shareholder capital is first  to demonstrate prospective value in the mineral properties sufficient to support substantial investments by large industry partners and second  to structure these investments to bring capital and long term development expertise to move the properties into production 
to demonstrate prospective value in the mineral properties and therefore bring investing industry partners into the mineral projects during the years ended december  and  management is evaluating having feasibility studies prepared on each of the projects 
some of these studies have already begun 
all the studies will be performed by independent engineering firms with the intent of proving up economic development plans for the properties based on current and projected market prices as well as existing or projected infrastructure 
in some instances  significant additional exploratory drilling will have to be completed to further delineate grades as well as the extent of the minerals in the ground 
the principal uncertainties in the successful implementation of our strategy are whether the feasibility studies will show  for any of the properties  that the minerals can be mined and processed profitably 
for some of the properties like gold and uranium  commodity prices will have to be sustained at levels not materially less than current prices  whether the feasibility studies will show volume and grades of mineralization  and manageable costs of mining and processing  which are sufficient to bring industry partners to the point of investment  and whether we can negotiate terms with industry partners which will return a substantial profit to the company for its retained interest and the project s development costs to that point in time 
to some extent  the economic feasibility of a particular property can be changed with modifications to the mine processing plans add or not add a circuit to process a particular mineral  enlarge or make smaller the mine plan  etc however  overall  the principal drivers to attainment of the business strategy are the quality of the minerals in the ground and international commodity prices 
please see the risk factor disclosures elsewhere in this report for more information on the risks and uncertainties in the business 
forward looking statements this report on form k for the years ended december   and includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended the exchange act 
all statements other than statements of historical fact included in this report are forward looking statements 
in addition  whenever words like expect  anticipate  or believe are used  we are making forward looking statements 
actual results may vary materially from the forward looking statements and there is no assurance that the assumptions used will be realized in fact 
critical accounting policies asset impairments we assess the impairment of property and equipment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
mineral claims we follow the full cost method of accounting for mineral properties 
accordingly  all costs associated with acquisition  exploration and development of oil and mineral reserves  including directly related overhead costs  are capitalized and are subject to ceiling tests to ensure the carrying value does not exceed the fair market value 
all capitalized costs of mineral properties subject to amortization and the estimated future costs to develop proved reserves  are amortized using the unit of production method using estimates of proved reserves 
investments in unproved properties and major construction and development projects are not amortized until proved reserves associated with the projects can be determined or until impairment occurs 
if the results of an assessment indicate that the properties are impaired  the capitalized cost of the property will be added to the costs to be amortized 
asset retirement obligations the company s policy is to accrue the liability for future reclamation costs of its mineral properties based on the current estimate of the future reclamation costs as determined by internal and external experts 
revenue recognition revenues are reported on a gross revenue basis and are recorded at the time services are provided or the commodity is sold 
sales of proved and unproved properties are accounted for as adjustments of capitalized costs with no gain or loss recognized  unless such adjustments would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves  in which case the gain or loss is recognized in income 
abandonment of properties are accounted for as adjustments of capitalized costs with no loss recognized 
use of accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
recent accounting pronouncements sfas r in december  the fasb issued its final standard on accounting for employee stock options  fas no 
revised  share based payment fas r 
fas r replaces fas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation fas  and supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
fas r requires companies to measure compensation costs for all share based payments  including grants of employee stock options  based on the fair value of the awards on the grant date and to recognize such expense over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award 
the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under fas will no longer be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
fas r is effective for all awards granted  modified  repurchased or cancelled after  and to unvested portions of previously issued and outstanding awards vesting after  interim or annual periods  beginning after june   which for us will be the first quarter of fiscal we are currently evaluating the effect of adopting fas r on our financial position and results of operations  and we have not yet determined whether the adoption of fas r will result in expenses in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under fas the company has reviewed other current outstanding statements from the financial accounting standards board and does not believe that any of those statements will have a material adverse affect on the financial statements of the company when adopted 
liquidity and capital resources during the year ended december   the company recorded a net gain of  and generated  of cash 
financing activities generated  primarily as a result of the exercise of warrants for the company s common stock and third party debt  investing activities generated  and operating activities consumed  on june   enterra us acquisitions inc acquisitions  a privately held washington corporation organized by enterra acquired all the outstanding stock of rmg  for which enterra paid  cash and issued  of enterra units the enterra initial units  net of the  adjustment for the purchase of overriding royalty interests effected may   and acquisitions issued  of class d shares of acquisitions 
the enterra initial units and the class d shares were issued pro rata to the rmg shareholders 
the company s and crested s participation in the consideration received was approximately  the company s consolidated subsidiary  yellowstone fuels  inc ysfi also received approximately  during the three months ended september   the company and crested sold all of the enterra initial units they received as a result of the sale of rmg 
as a result of the sale of these enterra initial units  the company recorded an increase of  in cash from investing activities and a gain of  from the sale of marketable securities 
the enterra initial units received by ysfi are reflected on the company s consolidated balance sheet as  as current assets marketable securities 
the class d shares of acquisitions are carried as  at december  as investments in non affiliates 
the company is required to hold the class d shares of acquisitions for a period of one year from june  after the holding period is satisfied  the company can exchange these shares on a one for one basis for units in enterra which will then be saleable on the toronto stock exchange vancouver tsx v 
the company has valued the class d shares of acquisitions as a derivative pursuant to sfas at december  the initial carrying value of the class d shares was per share 
using the risk free interest rate of and a volatility of at december  the acquisition class d shares have a value of per share 
the company therefore recorded a net gain on the derivative conversion right of the class d shares of acquisitions of  the class d shares of acquisitions will be revalued at each quarterly reporting period until they are converted to shares of enterra trust at which time they will be accounted for as marketable securities held for sale 
although the company s cash position increased by  during the year ended december  it is anticipated that the company may need to sell the remaining acquisition shares when converted to enterra units as well as seek industry partners or equity financing to fund mine exploration and development costs and also fund reclamation and general and administrative expenses 
we believe that the current market prices for gold  uranium and molybdenum are at levels that warrant the exploration and development of the company s mineral properties 
management of the company anticipates these metals prices remaining at levels which will allow the properties to be produced economically 
management of the company therefore believes that sufficient capital will be available to develop its mineral properties from strategic industry partners  debt financing  the sale of equity or a combination of the three 
the successful development and production of these properties would greatly enhance the liquidity and financial position of the company 
capital resources sale of rocky mountain gas  inc on june   the  class d shares of acquisitions not traded on any exchange owned by the company will be exchangeable  on a one for one basis  for additional enterra units the enterra additional units  the enterra additional units will be tradable on the tsx at that time 
crested also owns an additional  of class d shares of acquisitions which will be available for sale on june  a substantial portion of any cash received by crested from the sale of its class d shares will likely be applied to its debt of  to the company 
the ultimate value of the class d shares of acquisitions will not be determined until they are sold 
rmg s minority equity ownership of pinnacle gas resources  inc pinnacle was not included in the disposition of rmg  but was assigned to the company and crested in proportion to their ownership of rmg 
the company therefore received ownership of the pinnacle equity and crested 
enterra is entitled to be paid an amount of up to but not more than  if proceeds from a future disposition by the company and crested to a third party of their minority equity interest in pinnacle exceeds  currently  we have no information about whether or when pinnacle might become a public company or might be purchased by third parties 
the value of the minority equity position upon a future disposition could be more or less than  the boards of directors of the company and crested determined that the value of rmg s minority equity interest in pinnacle is approximately  based only upon pinnacle s sales of equity in and to its shareholders rmg did not participate in those sales 
management of the company may sell some or all of its equity in pinnacle at such time as pinnacle is either sold or becomes a public company 
agreements with uranium power corp 
in  we received  cash from uranium power corp 
upc under the december purchase and sale agreement for our wyoming uranium properties 
additional cash payments are required of million in and million in we also have signed a mining venture agreement with upc  by which the initial  of exploration costs on individual uranium properties is to be funded by upc

other during the twelve months ended december   the company received  from the exercise of  warrants and  from the exercise of  employee options 
an additional  shares underlying employee stock options were issued to the employees by the surrender of  shares of the company s common stock directly owned by the employees 
during the first quarter of  sgmi through ibk capital of toronto canada  began efforts to raise us to million none from us residents for drilling and operational funds of the sgmi property 
these funds are critical to the further delineation of the gold deposit in order that sgmi can raise sufficient funds to place the property into production 
no assurance can be given that sgmi will be successful in its efforts to raise the to million 
the company and crested have a line of credit with a commercial bank in the amount of  the line of credit is secured by certain real estate holdings and equipment 
this line credit is used for short term working capital needs associated with operations 
at december   the entire amount of  under the line of credit was available to the company and crested 
the company and crested continue to pursue the settlement of a long standing arbitration litigation regarding the sheep mountain partnership smp 
the litigation involves nukem  inc nukem and its subsidiary cycle resource investment corp 
of danbury connecticut 
the case is currently on remand to the arbitration panel following nukem s third appeal to the tenth circuit court of appeals 
prior to the remand  there was a million judgment entered by the us district court of colorado in favor of the company and crested 
the timing and cost of achieving final resolution cannot be predicted 
management of the company and crested believe that the ultimate outcome will be positive and in favor of the company 
capital requirements the capital requirements of the company during remain its general and administrative costs and expenses  permitting and development work on its gold property  and the ongoing maintenance  exploration and potential development of its uranium and molybdenum properties 
as a result of the rmg disposition  usecc no longer directly holds coalbed methane properties 
the company therefore is no longer liable to fund drilling programs and lease holding costs related to those properties 
maintaining mineral properties sheep mountain uranium properties as stated above  the mining agreement with upc is contractually committed to fund the majority of the expenses associated with maintaining the uranium properties in central wyoming and performing exploration drilling on them 
a budget of  for the first half of the year ending december  has been approved  relating to reclamation work at the sheep mountain properties  exploration drilling  geological and engineering work  and other costs 
upc has agreed to fund the first  of all approved projects up to a total of  and has advanced  against the approved budget 
the average care and maintenance costs associated with the sheep mountain uranium mineral properties in wyoming is approximately  per year of which upc is required to pay annually 
plateau resources limited uranium properties plateau owns and maintains the shootaring canyon uranium mill the shootaring mill 
due to increases in the market price for uranium during the years ended december  and  the company reconsidered its prior decision to reclaim the shootaring mill property 
in march  plateau filed an application with the state of utah to restart the shootaring mill 
see the form k report filed march  
if management s projections of placing the shootaring mill into production hold  reclamation on the property is not anticipated to commence until some time in it is anticipated million will be required to modify the shootaring mill s tailings facility to utah standards including posting additional reclamation bonding  and complete other mill upgrades before production can begin 
additionally  a circuit to process vanadium which is contained in almost all of the mineralized material found in nearby properties may be added to the shootaring mill 
when refurbished  the shootaring mill is projected to have the capacity to produce up to million pounds of uranium concentrates annually depending on the grade of material fed to the shootaring mill 
the company and crested are currently considering placing their ownership and cash flow rights in plateau and other uranium assets into a newly formed entity  us uranium ltd 
usul 
in order to fund the refurbishment of the mill and acquire additional uranium properties from which to produce uranium bearing ores  use and crested are seeking joint venture partners or equity participants 
in  the company sold its interests in the ticaboo town site ticaboo operations in southern utah to a non affiliated entity  the cactus group cactus 
the ticaboo property includes a motel  restaurant and lounge  convenience store  recreational boat storage and service facility  and improved residential and mobile home lots 
most of these properties had been acquired when the shootaring mill was acquired in the company carried the loan which had a balance due at december of approximately million at annual interest 
cactus was to make payments of  per month until august at which time a balloon note in the amount of million was due 
cactus became in default on its cash payments as well as its contractual covenants to maintain the properties and equipment during the fourth quarter of on february  the company re acquired by foreclosure sale the ticaboo properties 
management of the company is evaluating the properties to determine the costs of deferred maintenance and operations that may be necessary until such time as the assets can be sold or leased 
until an actual detailed inspection of the properties is made it is not possible to estimate what the remedial costs and expenses may be 
at the time of filing management of the company does not anticipate operating the ticaboo properties 
management is seeking a third party to either lease or purchase the properties 
until such an arrangement can be secured by the company  the company will be obligated for minimal holding costs 
the company may spend an estimated  in refurbishing costs on the properties 
sutter gold mining inc sgmi properties because of the recent increase in the price of gold  management of sgmi has decided to continue moving the project forward with production as the ultimate goal 
no extensive development work or mill construction will be initiated until such time as funding from debt and or equity sources is in place 
the goal of the company s management is to have the sgmi properties be self supporting and thereby not requiring any capital resource commitment from the company 
on december   sgmc merged with globemin resources  inc  a canadian company  and changed its name to sutter gold mining inc  sgmi 
sgmi is traded on the tsx venture exchange 
sgmi had sufficient capital to pay for the work done on the properties during calendar additional financing is being sought by sgmi 
until such financing is obtained  the company may be required to fund standby costs at the sgmi properties and legal and accounting work necessary to obtain additional equity financing 
management anticipates that during the twelve months ended december   this cash commitment will not exceed  lucky jack molybdenum project the company and crested re acquired the lucky jack molybdenum project  formerly known as the mt 
emmons molybdenum property  located near crested butte  colorado on february  the property was returned to the company and crested by pd in accordance with a amended royalty deed and agreement between usecc and amax inc amax 
the lucky jack project includes a total of patented and approximately unpatented mining claims  which together approximate  acres  or over square miles of mining claims 
the company and crested leased various patented and unpatented mining claims on the mt 
emmons property to amax in in the late s  amax delineated a large deposit of molybdenum on the properties  reportedly containing approximately million tons of mineralized material averaging molybdenum disulfide mos in  amax constructed a water treatment plant at the mt 
emmons property to treat water flowing from old mine workings and for potential use in milling operations 
by  amax had reportedly spent an estimated million in the acquisition of the property  securing water rights  extensive exploration  ore body delineation  mine planning  metallurgical testing and other activities involving the mineral deposit 
amax was merged into cyprus minerals in to form cyprus amax 
pd then acquired the mt 
emmons property in through its acquisition of cyprus amax 
thereafter  pd acquired additional water rights to mine and mill the deposit 
the company and crested have decided to pursue permitting and development of the property and are now engaged in the active pursuit of a sizable mining industry partner to co develop and mine the property 
in order to do so the company and crested may have to obtain a mine feasibility study which is estimated will cost approximately million 
of this total amount it is anticipated by management that approximately million will be spent during the year ended december  conveyance of the property to the company and crested also includes the transfer of ownership and operational responsibility of the mine water treatment plant located on the properties 
operating costs for the water treatment plant are expected to approximate million annually 
in an effort to assure continued compliance  the company and crested have retained the technical expert and contractor hired by pd on january  to operate the water treatment plant 
on october   pd filed a motion with the district court to recover attorney s fees and expenses in the declaratory judgment action against the company and crested 
pd is claiming  in attorney s fees and expenses and  in costs incurred for the operation of the water treatment plant for the last three years 
these claims were not part of the initial litigation with pd 
the company and crested have filed a response with the court denying that usecc owes pd such monies 
it is not known how or when the court will rule on these issues 
management of the company believes that no monies are due to pd 
the company and crested expect to transfer the lucky jack molybdenum project to a new subsidiary  us moly corp 
in the near future 
debt payments during the year ended december   the company repaid  in debt plus  in interest to certain investors through the issuance of  shares of the company s common stock 
the sale of rmg also resulted in the repayment by enterra of approximately  to petrobridge investment management  a mezzanine credit facility 
rmg s wholly owned subsidiary  rmg i  had used the petrobridge loan to finance a portion of its purchase of assets from hi pro production  a gillette  wyoming coal bed methane company 
the repayment of both the investor and petrobridge debt did not consume any cash of the company 
debt to a third party lender  geddes and company of phoenix  arizona  in the amount of  was completely retired with cash during the quarter ended september  other cash payments on third party debt totaled  these cash payments along with the non cash retirement of debt mentioned above resulted in a total reduction of debt during the year ended december  of  debt to non related parties at december  was  this debt consists of debt related to the purchase of vehicles and a corporate aircraft 
reclamation costs the asset retirement obligation on the plateau uranium mining and milling properties in utah at december  was  this liability is fully funded by cash investments that are recorded as long term restricted investments 
due to the increased market price of uranium  the reclamation of this property has been delayed significantly and is not anticipated to commence until the delay until reclamation commences resulted in recognition of a reduction of asset retirement obligation expense of the asset retirement obligation of the sheep mountain uranium properties in wyoming at december  is  and is covered by a reclamation bond which is secured by a pledge of certain real estate assets of the company and crested 
it is anticipated that  of reclamation work on the sheep mountain properties will be performed during the asset retirement obligation for sgmi at december  is  which is covered by a cash bond 
it is not anticipated that any cash resources will be used for asset retirement obligations at sgmi during the year ending december  other the employees of the company are not given raises on a regular basis 
in consideration of this and in appreciation of the work required to develop and sell rmg  management of the company accepted the recommendation of its compensation committee to pay all employees and directors a bonus upon the closing of the sale of rmg to enterra 
the board of directors has granted similar bonuses in the past 
in addition  bonuses may be paid to some of the key individuals involved over the past years in the nukem case once it is resolved

operating costs and expenses incurred in operations during the year ended december  increased  over those costs and expenses recognized from operations during the prior year 
expenses from real estate operations remained constant during the year ended december  when compared with those expenses incurred during the year ended december  mineral holding costs increased during the year ended december  over those cost recorded during the previous year by  the increase in mine holding costs were as a result of increased activity on the properties that the company holds for the development of uranium and gold as well as work done on the molybdenum property returned by phelps dodge pd 
general and administrative costs and expenses increased by  during the year ended december  when compared with the general and administrative costs and expenses recognized during the year ended december  the primary reasons for these increases were increased labor costs associated with additional professional staff to evaluate the company and crested s mineral properties and a bonus associated with the sale of rmg  increased professional services associated with the nukem arbitration hearing as well the litigation with pd  costs associated with the adoption of sarbanes oxley  and work performed on the sgmi property evaluations and associated increased general and administrative expenses of sgmi

as a result of increased market prices for uranium the reclamation of these properties was moved further out into the future which resulted in  being reversed out of asset retirement obligation expense 
this reversal of cost was offset against the amount of reclamation liability accreted during the year ended december  which resulted in a net cost and expense reduction of  during the year ended december   other income and expenses resulted in a loss of  while other income and expenses recognized during the year ended december  resulted in income of  the primary changes in other income during the year ended december  were a gain of  recognized on the sale of assets  a gain of  from the sale of marketable securities  a decrease of  in the revenues recorded from the sale of investments  gain on the valuation of the derivative associated with the acquisitions class d shares of  discussed above  dividend income of  an increase of  in interest income over interest income recognized during the previous year 
these increases in other income were offset by a significant increase in interest expense of  over the interest expense recognized during the previous year to a total of  in interest expense during the year ended december  the increase in sale of assets during the year ended december  was as a result of a cash payment of  and the receipt of  shares of upc common stock valued at  received from upc to enter into an agreement described above in capital resources and the settlement of a claim on a real estate property in colorado 
the gain on the sale of marketable securities was as a result of the company and crested selling  shares and  shares  respectively of enterra initial units 
the decrease in of  in revenues from the sale of investments is as a result of the company selling fewer shares of ruby mining company ruby shares which it holds as an investment 
the company sold its interest in ruby several years ago but still retains a portion of the common stock 
as of december  there was no book basis in the shares 
interest expense increased from  during the twelve months ended december  by  to  during the twelve months ended december  the reason for the increase in interest expense is related directly to the senior convertible debentures which were issued in february in the amount of  with  of prepaid interest please see capital resources above  and the debt to geddes 
both of these debt instruments were retired in full during the company recognized  in interest expense  paid with cash  and the amortization of  of the remaining discount taken on the geddes loan for total interest related to the geddes loan of  the senior convertible debentures had prepaid interest of  and a discount on the note of  due to the issue of warrants to the holder of the note and a beneficial conversion factor of  for total interest expense of  the remaining interest of  which was paid during the year ended december  was on various notes for equipment and the company s aircraft 
discontinued operations  net of taxes  during the year ended december  was  actual consolidated income recognized by the company for the sale of rmg was  less a provision for income taxes of  and a loss from discontinued operations of  of the pre tax net income  net of the loss from discontinued operations of  the company recorded a gain of  crested recorded  and ysfi recorded a loss on the transaction of  these amounts are derived by the receipt of  cash and the enterra initial units and the class d shares of acquisitions discussed above under liquidity and capital resources less the company and its affiliates basis in the rmg ownership and less the closing costs of the rmg sale 
all previously reported operations of rmg are reported on this filing as discontinued operations 
during the year ended december   the company recorded a net loss of  from the discontinued rmg operations in comparison to a net loss of  from the rmg operations during the year ended december  after a provision of alternative minimum taxes due on income recognized during the year ended december   the company recognized a net gain of  or basic per share as compared to a net loss of  or a loss of basic per share for the year ended december year ended december  compared to the year ended december  operating revenues management fees and other revenues recognized by the company increased during the year ended december  this increase came as a result of the company entering into a purchase and sales agreement with bell coast capital corp 
now named uranium power corp 
upc  a british columbia corporation tsx v ucp v for the sale to upc of an undivided interest in the sheep mountain properties 
upc paid  during the year ended december   the company did not have any similar revenues during the year ended december  revenues from real estate operations decreased during the year ended december  from those recorded during the year ended december  by  this decrease was as a result of reduced lot sales at the plateau operations in utah 
operating costs and expenses the holding costs associated with the company s mineral properties during the year ended december  remained constant with those costs recorded during the previous year 
it is anticipated that these costs will increase during as the company moves forward with the permitting process relating to its uranium and gold properties 
additionally the holding cost of the molybdenum property  which the company received back from phelps dodge  will increase these costs 
all costs associated with the acquisition of additional properties will be capitalized but the permitting costs will be expensed 
real estate operating costs and general and administrative costs were reduced during the year ended december  from those of the year ended december  the reduction of real estate costs is insignificant   and is related to the reduction of the company s involvement in the southern utah property sold to a third party which had previously been operated by plateau 
the reduction in general and administrative costs of  was due to the ongoing efforts of the company s management to reduce overhead and related expenses 
other income and expenses other income and expenses increased from net expenses of  during the year ended december  to net income of  during the year ended december  due to the positive upward movement of the market prices for the minerals in which the company is involved it has determined to retain its remaining mineral development and extraction equipment 
the determination to retain this equipment is a direct cause of the reduction of  from the year ended december  to the year ended december  in the gain on the sale of assets 
the income recognized from the sale of investments is as a result of the liquidation of common stock of a company  ruby which the company sold several years ago 
the company retained ownership of a portion of its former shares of common stock in ruby and had no book basis in the shares 
during the year ended december  the company sold  shares of ruby common stock and received  the company also received  from the sale of a piece of real estate during the year ended december  which had no book value 
interest revenues recognized during the year ended december  decreased from those recognized during the year ended december  due to the reduced amount of cash invested in interest bearing accounts 
interest expenses decreased from  during the twelve months ended december  by  to  at december  all previously reported operations of rmg are reported on this filing as discontinued operations
