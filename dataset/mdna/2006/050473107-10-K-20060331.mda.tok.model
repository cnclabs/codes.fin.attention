item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis is designed to provide a better understanding of various factors related to the company s results of operations and financial condition 
such discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with business and financial statements and supplementary data 
the purpose of this discussion is to focus on significant changes in the financial condition and results of operations of the company during the three years ended december   and this discussion and analysis is intended to supplement and highlight information contained in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the selected financial data presented elsewhere herein 
overview the company was incorporated in delaware in  and in it succeeded its alabama predecessor as the bank holding company controlling the bank 
the company s business is conducted primarily through the bank 
like most financial institutions  the company s profitability depends largely upon the bank s net interest income  which is the difference between the interest received on earning assets  such as loans and investment securities  and the interest paid on interest bearing liabilities  principally deposits and borrowings 
the company s results of operations are also affected by the bank s provision for loan losses  non interest expenses  such as salaries  employee benefits  and occupancy expenses  and non interest income  such as mortgage loan fees and service charges on deposit accounts 
economic conditions  competition and federal monetary and fiscal policies also affect financial institutions 
for example  was characterized by steadily increasing interest rates intended to stabilize the economy and stimulate industrial economic growth 
the bank closed over million in residential mortgage activity during approximately of the bank s gross revenue was a product of its traditional residential mortgage origination business 
management anticipates a decline in mortgage production volumes and revenues during due to anticipated higher interest rates 
lending activities are also influenced by regional and local economic factors  such as housing supply and demand  competition among lenders  customer preferences and levels of personal income and savings in the company s psa 
our balanced growth continued during  with increases in assets  loans  deposits and earnings per share 
the following chart shows our growth in these areas from december  to december  december  change december  change december  dollars in thousands  except per share data net earnings net earnings per share basic and diluted total assets investment securities loans deposits shareholders equity return on average total assets return on average total equity 
index to financial statements critical accounting policies the accounting and financial reporting policies of the company conform to united states generally accepted accounting principles and to general practices within the banking industry 
the allowance for loan losses is an accounting policy applied by the company that is deemed critical 
critical accounting policies are defined as policies that are important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations  and that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgements 
the company s financial results could differ significantly if different judgements or estimates are applied in the application of this policy 
see allowance for loan losses and risk elements 
management analyzes the loan portfolio to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and the appropriate provision required to maintain a level management considers adequate to absorb anticipated loan losses 
when management believes the collection of the principal of a loan is unlikely  a loan is charged off against the allowance for loan losses 
subsequent recoveries of principal are added back to the allowance for loan losses 
management s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is based on a formal analysis which assesses the risks within the loan portfolio 
in assessing the adequacy of the allowance  management reviews the size  quality and risk of loans in the portfolio 
management also considers such factors as the bank s loan loss experience  the amount of past due and nonperforming loans  specific known risk  the status and amount of nonperforming assets  underlying collateral values securing loans  current and anticipated economic conditions and other factors that affect the allowance for loan losses 
in  the credit administration area reviewed approximately of the total loan portfolio 
in addition  the bank has engaged an outside loan review consultant  on a semi annual basis  to perform an independent review of the quality of the loan portfolio 
in  the outside loan review consultant reviewed approximately of the total loan portfolio 
the company is closely monitoring certain portions of its loan portfolio that management believes to be of higher risk under the current economic situation 
management believes the allowance for loan losses is adequate at december  while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans  future additions to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary based on economic changes and other changes that can effect the various borrowers 
certain economic and interest rate factors could have a material impact on the determination of the allowance for loan losses 
the bank s allowance for loan losses is also subject to regulatory examinations and determinations as to adequacy  which may take into account such factors as the methodology used to calculate the allowance for loan losses and the size of the allowance for loan losses in comparison to a group of peer banks identified by the regulators 
during their routine examinations of banks  the federal reserve and the alabama superintendent may require a bank to make additional provisions to its allowance for loan losses where  in the opinion of the regulators  credit evaluations and allowance for loan loss methodology differ materially from those of management 
see supervision and regulation 
management  considering current information and events regarding a borrower s ability to repay its obligations  considers a loan to be impaired when the ultimate collectibility of all amounts due  according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement  is in doubt 
when a loan is considered to be impaired  the amount of the impairment is measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate 
if the loan is collateral dependent  the fair value of the collateral is used to determine the amount of the impairment 
impairment losses are included in the allowance for loan losses through a charge to the provision for loan losses 
cash receipts on accruing impaired loans are applied to principal and interest under the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
cash receipts on impaired loans that are not accruing interest are applied first to principal and then to interest income 
commercial real estate mortgage loans were million which represented of the total loans at december  the largest commercial real estate mortgage relationships approximated million or of the total loans outstanding at december  there are no significant concentrations of industries or loan types within the commercial real estate loan portfolio 
the bank s commercial real estate loans are secured by real estate located principally in lee county  alabama 
accordingly  the ultimate collectibility of a substantial portion of the bank s loan portfolio is susceptible to changes in market conditions in this area 
a rapidly rising interest rate environment could have a material impact on certain borrowers ability to pay 
the company currently 
index to financial statements anticipates that interest rates will slightly increase in in the event of a recession or a significant increase in interest rates  the bank s credit costs and losses could increase significantly

financial condition total assets at december  and were  and  respectively  reflecting growth of  or 
this increase in total assets resulted primarily from an increase of  in loans  including loans held for sale 
the primary sources of funding for these loans were an increase in total deposits of  and a decrease in investment securities available for sale of  during investment securities investment securities held to maturity were  and  at december  and  respectively

this decrease of  or reflects purchases of  in us agency securities   in mortgage backed securities   in collateralized mortgage obligations cmos   in corporate securities and  in state and political subdivision securities 
this increase is offset by  of scheduled paydowns  maturities and calls of principal amounts 
in addition   of us agency securities   of state and political subdivisions  and  of mortgage backed securities were sold in the composition of the company s total investment securities portfolio reflects the company s investment strategy to provide acceptable levels of interest income from portfolio yields while maintaining an appropriate level of liquidity to assist with controlling the company s interest rate position 
in and  the company invested million in tax exempt securities to fully realize the benefits of the preferential treatment afforded tax exempt securities under the tax laws 
the majority of the purchases of taxable securities have been in investment grade mortgage backed securities mbs and cmos because of their liquidity  credit quality and yield characteristics 
the yields  values  and durations of such mbs and cmos generally vary with interest rates  prepayment levels  and general economic conditions  and as a result  the values of such instruments may be more volatile and unpredictable than other instruments with similar maturities 
such mbs and cmos also may have longer stated maturities than other securities  which may result in further price volatility 
the weighted average yields for state and political subdivisions have been computed on a tax equivalent basis

loans held for sale total loans held for sale decreased  or to  at december  compared to  at december  the decrease in was primarily due to reclassification of a number of loans that the bank decided to no longer sell in the secondary market 
in addition to originating mortgage loans for its own portfolio  the company also originates residential mortgage loans that are sold in the secondary market 
in addition to selling real estate mortgage loans to the federal national mortgage association fnma with the bank retaining the servicing rights  the bank has arranged with one mortgage servicing company to originate and sell  without recourse  residential first mortgage real estate loans  with servicing rights released 
during  the bank sold mortgage loans totaling approximately  to fnma  with the bank retaining the servicing rights  and sold mortgage loans totaling approximately  to the mortgage servicing company with servicing rights released

index to financial statements allowance for loan losses and risk elements interest on loans is normally accrued from the date an advance is made 
the performance of loans is evaluated primarily on the basis of a review of each customer relationship over a period of time and the judgment of lending officers as to the ability of borrowers to meet the repayment terms of loans 
if there is reasonable doubt as to the repayment of a loan in accordance with the agreed terms  the loan may be placed on a nonaccrual basis pending the sale of any collateral or a determination as to whether sources of repayment exist 
this action may be taken even though the financial condition of the borrower or the collateral may be sufficient ultimately to reduce or satisfy the obligation 
generally  when a loan is placed on a nonaccrual basis  all payments are applied to reduce principal to the extent necessary to eliminate doubt as to the repayment of the loan 
thereafter  any interest income on a nonaccrual loan is recognized only on a cash basis 
the company s policy generally is to place a loan on nonaccrual status when it is contractually past due days or more as to payment of principal or interest 
a loan may be placed on nonaccrual status at an earlier date when concerns exist as to the ultimate collection of principal or interest 
at the time a loan is placed on nonaccrual status  interest previously accrued but not collected is reversed and charged against current earnings 
loans that are contractually past due days or more that are well secured and are in the process of collection generally are not placed on nonaccrual status 
lending officers are responsible for the ongoing review and administration of loans assigned to them 
as such  they make the initial identification of loans which present some difficulty in collection or where circumstances indicate that the possibility of loss exists 
the responsibilities of the lending officers include the collection effort on a delinquent loan 
to strengthen internal controls in the collection of delinquencies  senior management and the directors loan committee are informed of the status of delinquent and watch or problem loans on a monthly basis 
senior management reviews the allowance for loan losses and makes recommendations to the directors loan committee as to loan charge offs on a monthly basis 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s assessment of the risk associated with extending credit and its evaluation of the quality of the loan portfolio 
management analyzes the loan portfolio to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and the appropriate provision required to maintain a level considered adequate to absorb anticipated loan losses 
in assessing the adequacy of the allowance  management reviews the size  quality and risk of loans in the portfolio 
management also considers such factors as the bank s loan loss experience  the amount of past due and nonperforming loans  specific known risks  the status and amount of nonperforming assets  underlying collateral values securing loans  current and anticipated economic conditions and other factors which affect the allowance for loan losses 
an analysis of the credit quality of the loan portfolio and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is prepared by the bank s credit administration area and presented to the directors loan committee on a monthly basis 
in addition  the bank has engaged outside loan review consultants  on a semi annual basis  to perform an independent review of the quality of the loan portfolio 
the bank s allowance for loan losses is also subject to regulatory examinations and determinations as to adequacy  which may take into account such factors as the methodology used to calculate the allowance for loan losses and the size of the allowance for loan losses in comparison to a group of peer banks identified by the regulators 
during their routine examinations of banks  the federal reserve and the alabama superintendent may require a bank to make additional provisions to its allowance for loan losses where  in the opinion of the regulators  credit evaluations and allowance for loan loss methodology differ materially from those of management 
see supervision and regulation 
while it is the bank s policy to charge off in the current period loans for which a loss is considered probable  there are additional risks of future losses that cannot be quantified precisely or attributed to particular loans or classes of loans 
because these risks include the state of the economy  management s judgment as to the adequacy of the allowance is necessarily approximate and imprecise 

index to financial statements the following table summarizes the levels of the allowance for loan losses at the end of the last five years and activity in the allowance during such years allowance for loan loss activity for year ended december  dollars in thousands balance at beginning of period provision for loan losses charge offs commercial  financial and agricultural real estate consumer total charge offs recoveries commercial  financial and agricultural real estate consumer total recoveries net charge offs balance at end of period ratio of allowance for loan losses to loans outstanding ratio of allowance for loan losses to nonaccrual loans  renegotiated loans  and other nonperforming assets ratio of net charge offs to average loans outstanding the allowance for loan losses was  or of total outstanding loans at december   compared to  or of total outstanding loans at december  this increase in the allowance for loan losses as of december  compared to december  was primarily due to loan growth 
although the provision for loan losses decreased in  the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans remained fairly consistent due to the decrease in charge offs combined with loan growth in in  there was one large charge off for which the company had allocated a specific allowance 
during  the company had loan charge offs totaling  and recoveries of  as compared to  in charge offs and recoveries of  in the prior year 
charge offs decreased significantly in due to improved loan performance 
charge offs for primarily consisted of the one large loan that was charged off 
management believes that the  allowance for loan losses at december  of total outstanding loans  is adequate to absorb known risks in the portfolio at such date 
however  no assurance can be given that adverse economic circumstances generally  including current economic events  or other events  including additional loan review or examination findings or changes in borrowers financial conditions  will not result in increased losses in the bank s loan portfolio or in additional provisions to the allowance for loan losses 
the bank has been engaged in enhanced reviews of its loan approval and credit grading processes 
the bank has sought to better price its loans consistent with its costs of funds and its assessment of potential credit risk 
the bank does not currently allocate its allowance for loan losses among its various classifications of loans 
the increase in the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to nonperforming assets between year end and year end was primarily due to the reduction in nonaccrual loans 
the increase in the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to nonperforming assets between year end and year end was due to the reduction in nonaccrual loans and a decrease in the allowance for loan losses offset by an increase in other nonperforming assets 

index to financial statements while management recognizes that there is more risk traditionally associated with commercial and consumer lending as compared to real estate mortgage lending  the bank currently has a tiered approach to determine the adequacy of its allowance for loan losses 
this methodology focuses on the determination of the specific and general loss allowances for certain loans classified as problem credits and uses a five year historical loss factor to determine the loss allocation for the remainder of the loan portfolio as opposed to allocations based on major loan categories 
level i includes specific allowances that have been reserved for impaired loans where management has identified specific losses 
level ii allowances are set aside to cover general losses associated with problem loans which possess more than a normal degree of credit risk  but where no specific losses have been identified 
these loans have been criticized or classified by the bank s regulators  external loan review personnel engaged by the bank  or internally by management 
the five year historical loss factors  subject to certain minimum percentages considering regulatory guidelines  are applied to the level ii problem loans in determining the allocation 
level iii is the allowance for the balance of the loan portfolio 
the loans in this tier consist of all loans that are not classified as level i or level ii problem credits  and less risk free loans 
risk free loans are defined as loans fully secured by cash or cash equivalents and readily marketable collateral 
local economic conditions are considered in determining the adequacy of the company s allowance for loan losses 
the allocation for level iii is determined by applying the historical loss factor  derived from prior years actual experience  to the adjusted outstanding balance for this classification 
at december   the allowance for loan losses was allocated to approximately million for criticized and classified loans level ii and approximately million for the general reserve level iii 
since there were no impaired loans at december   none of the allowance for loan losses is allocated for impaired loans level i 
at december   the company had no impaired loans 
at december   the company had approximately  of impaired loans  which included three loans to three borrowers with a total valuation allowance of approximately  nonperforming assets nonperforming assets consist of loans on nonaccrual status  loans that have been renegotiated at terms more favorable to the borrower than those for similar credits  real estate and other assets acquired in partial or full satisfaction of loan obligations and accruing loans that are past due days or more 
nonperforming assets were   and  at december   and  respectively 
these levels represent a decrease of  or for the year ended december   and a decrease of  for the year ended december  the decrease in was mainly due to a decrease in nonaccrual loans and other real estate owned 
the decrease in was mainly due to a decrease in nonaccrual loans

the company did not recognize any interest income on nonaccrual loans for the years ended december   and other potential problem loans potential problem loans consist of those loans where management has serious doubts as to the borrower s ability to comply with the present loan repayment terms 
at december   the company had identified loans totaling approximately  or of total loans  which were considered potential problem loans 
at december   the company had identified loans totaling approximately  or of total loans  which were considered potential problem loans 
such loans have been considered in the determination of the level ii allowance previously discussed

this trend is the result of management s decision to maintain a competitive position in its deposit rate structure coupled with the bank s marketing efforts to attract local deposits and fund its loan growth

this unconsolidated subsidiary issued approximately million in preferred trust securities 
the company obtained these proceeds through a note payable to trust junior subordinated debentures 
as of december  and   of the note payable to trust was classified as tier capital for regulatory purposes 
for regulatory purposes  the trust preferred securities represent a minority investment in a consolidated subsidiary  which is currently included in tier capital so long as it does not exceed of total tier capital 
under financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
fin and revised amendment to fin fin r  however  the trust subsidiary must be deconsolidated for accounting purposes 
as a result of this accounting pronouncement  the federal reserve on march  
index to financial statements announced changes to its capital adequacy rules  including the capital treatment of trust preferred securities 
the federal reserve s new rules  which took effect in early april  permit the company to continue to treat its outstanding trust preferred securities as tier capital for the first years of the year term of the related junior subordinated notes 
during the last five years preceding maturity  the amount included as capital will decline per year 
the federal reserve s final rule with respect to the capital treatment of trust preferred securities did not adversely affect the company and the bank s regulatory capital and the company and the bank s capital ratios remained at an adequate level to allow the company and the bank to continue to be well capitalized under applicable banking regulations 
off balance sheet arrangements the company is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
such instruments involve elements of credit risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
the company s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to these financial instruments is represented by the contractual amount of these instruments 
the company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on balance sheet instruments 
the financial instruments whose contract amounts represent credit risk as of december  are as follows commitments to extend credit standby letters of credit commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
standby letters of credit are commitments issued by the company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
those guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements 
all guarantees expire within one year 
the credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers 
the company holds various assets as collateral supporting those commitments for which collateral is deemed necessary 
capital resources and stockholders equity the company s consolidated stockholders equity was  and  at december  and  respectively  a decrease of  or 
the decrease in stockholders equity for is mainly due to a decrease in the fair value of investment securities available for sale as well as cash dividends paid in this is offset by net earnings for the increase in stockholders equity for is mainly due to an increase in net earnings and the fair value of investment securities available for sale 
this is offset by cash dividends for the company has funded its capital growth primarily through retained earnings since its common stock offering 
the company has million of trust preferred securities that count as tier capital for regulatory purposes 
see supervision and regulation 
during  cash dividends of  or per share  were declared on the common stock as compared to  or per share  in the company plans to continue a dividend payout policy that provides cash returns to its investors and allows the company to maintain adequate capital to support future growth and capital adequacy  however  the company is dependent on dividends from the bank as discussed subsequently 
management believes that a strong capital position is important to the continued profitability of the company and provides a foundation for future growth as well as promoting depositor and investor confidence in the institution

failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory actions  and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material effect on the company s financial statements 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  the bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the bank s assets  liabilities and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
the capital amounts and classification of the bank are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weightings and other factors 
management believes  as of december   that the bank meets all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject 
see supervision and regulation 
the following table sets forth the bank s actual capital levels and the related required capital levels at december  actual capital amount actual ratio required capital amount required ratio dollars in thousands tier risk based capital leverage ratio total risk based capital liquidity liquidity is the company s ability to convert assets into cash equivalents in order to meet daily cash flow requirements  primarily for deposit withdrawals  loan demand and maturing liabilities 
without proper management  the company could experience higher costs of obtaining funds due to insufficient liquidity  while excessive liquidity can lead to a decline in earnings due to the cost of foregoing alternative higher yielding investment opportunities 
at the bank  asset liquidity is provided primarily through cash  the repayment and maturity of investment securities  and the sale and repayment of loans 
sources of liability liquidity include customer deposits  federal funds purchased and investment securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
although deposit growth historically has been a primary source of liquidity  such balances may be influenced by changes in the banking industry  interest rates available on other investments  general economic conditions  competition and other factors 
the bank has participated in the fhlb s advance program to obtain funding for its growth 
advances include both fixed and variable terms and are taken out with varying maturities 
this line is collateralized by a blanket lien against the bank s one to four family residential mortgage loans and investment securities 
at december   the bank had  in advances from fhlb 
net cash provided by operating activities of  for the twelve months ended december  consisted primarily of net earnings of  in addition  the company had  in proceeds from the sale of loans that were originated for resale

in addition  securities sold under agreements to repurchase decreased by  and the company paid cash dividends of  the company depends mainly on dividends  management fees and lease payments from the bank for its liquidity 
the company only receives cash dividends from the bank if the cash flow from other sources is not sufficient to maintain a positive cash flow  also giving consideration to regulatory restrictions 
accordingly  the bank paid the company   and  in cash dividends for   and respectively 
the company provides services to the bank for which it is paid a management fee comparable to the fee an unaffiliated vendor would receive 
in addition  the bank leases premises and equipment from the company for its operations 
leases between the bank and the company are based on the same terms and conditions as leases to unaffiliated parties leasing space in the same building 
the bank paid the company  and  in management fees for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the bank also paid  and  in lease payments for the years ended december  and  respectively 
these funds were used to pay operating expenses and fund dividends to the company s shareholders 
in addition  the bank makes transfers to the company  under its tax sharing agreement  for payment of consolidated tax obligations 
the tax sharing agreement calls for the allocation of the consolidated tax liability or benefit between the company and each subsidiary based on their individual tax positions as if each entity filed a separate tax return 
the bank has increased its loan to deposit ratio to at december  from at december  the bank has been monitoring its liquidity  and has sought to better price its loans consistent with its costs of funds and the bank s assessment of potential credit risk 
interest rate sensitivity management an integral part of the funds management of the company and the bank is to maintain a reasonably balanced position between interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
the bank s asset liability management committee alco committee is charged with the responsibility of managing  to the degree prudently possible  its exposure to interest rate risk  while attempting to provide earnings enhancement opportunities 
the dollar difference between rate sensitive assets and liabilities for a given period of time is referred to as the rate sensitive gap gap 
a gap ratio is calculated by dividing rate sensitive assets by rate sensitive liabilities 
due to the nature of the bank s balance sheet structure and the market approach to pricing of liabilities  management and the board of directors recognize that achieving a perfectly matched gap position in any given time frame would be extremely rare 
alco committee has determined that an acceptable level of interest rate risk would be for net interest income to fluctuate no more than given a change in selected interest rates of up or down basis points over any month period 
using an increase of basis points and a decrease of basis points  at december   the bank s net interest income would increase approximately in a falling rate environment and would decrease approximately in a rising rate environment 
interest rate scenario models are prepared using software created and licensed by the bankers bank 
for purposes of measuring interest rate sensitivity  company management provides growth assumptions to incorporate over the month period 
although demand and savings accounts are subject to immediate withdrawal  all passbook savings and regular now accounts are reflected in the model as repricing based on the bankers bank model standards 
for repricing gap  these accounts are repricing immediately

this negative gap indicates that the company has more interest bearing liabilities than interest earning assets that reprice within the gap period 
the bank s alco committee realizes that gap is limited in scope since it does not capture all the options of repricing opportunities in the balance sheet 
therefore  alco committee places its emphasis on income at risk and economic value of equity measurements 
the bank enters into interest rate protection contracts to help manage its interest rate exposure 
these contracts include interest rate swaps  caps and floors 
interest rate swap transactions involve the exchange of fixed and floating rate interest payment obligations based on the underlying notional principal amounts 
interest rate caps and floors are purchased by the bank for a non refundable fixed amount 
the bank receives interest based on the underlying notional principal amount if the specified index rises above the cap rate or falls below the floor strike rate 
notional principal amounts are used to express the volume of these transactions  but because they are never exchanged  the amounts subject to credit risk are much smaller 
risks associated with interest rate contracts include interest rate risk and creditworthiness of the counterparty 
these risks are considered in the bank s overall asset liability management program 
the bank utilizes periodic financial statements issued by the counterparty to analyze the creditworthiness of the counterparty prior to entering into a contract and to monitor changes in the financial condition of the counterparty throughout the term of the contract 
current contracts are issued by a securities broker dealer and were entered into with the purpose of managing the bank s interest rate exposure 
although none of the interest rate protection agreements are traded on any organized exchange  an active secondary market is available to the company for such contracts 

index to financial statements the bank s asset liability management policy states that establishing limits on interest rate swaps  caps and floors can be somewhat confusing or misleading since the notional amount by which these instruments are expressed is never exchanged between counterparties and therefore is not at risk 
furthermore  since they represent tools used by alco committee to manage imbalances in the bank s balance sheet in a prudent and cost effective manner  the appropriate volume of swaps for the bank is not static  it changes with elements such as the economic environment  the capital position and the ability to efficiently replicate hedging actions in the cash markets 
the bank endeavors to limit outstanding notional value of cash contracts executed for purposes of managing net interest income to of total assets as reported in the most recent quarterly call report 
notional value of cash contracts executed with one counterparty are limited to of total assets as reported in the bank s most recent quarterly call report 
as of december  and  the company had a cash flow hedge with a notional amount of million for the purpose of converting the interest payments on floating rate money market accounts to a fixed rate 
the company started exchanging payments in march for this interest rate swap based on the three month treasury bill investment rate 
the company recorded a liability for this swap of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this interest rate swap will mature in july there was not any material hedge ineffectiveness from this cash flow hedge recognized in the income statement 
effects of inflation and changing prices inflation generally increases the costs of funds and operating overhead  and to the extent loans and other assets bear variable rates  the yields on such assets 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates generally have a more significant effect on the performance of a financial institution than the effects of general levels of inflation 
in addition  inflation affects financial institutions cost of goods and services purchased  the cost of salaries and benefits  occupancy expense and similar items 
inflation and related increases in interest rates generally decrease the market value of investments and loans held and may adversely affect liquidity  earnings and stockholders equity 
mortgage originations and refinancings tend to slow as interest rates increase  and such increases likely will reduce the company s volume of such activities and the income from the sale of residential mortgage loans in the secondary market

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk  with respect to the company  is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and prices 
the risk of loss can result in either lower fair market values or reduced net interest income 
although the company manages other risk  such as credit and liquidity  management considers interest rate risk to be the more significant market risk and such risk could potentially have the largest material effect on the company s financial condition 
further  the company believes the potential reduction of net interest income may be more significant than the effect of reduced fair market values 
the company does not maintain a trading portfolio  or deal in international instruments  therefore  it is not exposed to risks related to trading activities or foreign currencies 

index to financial statements the company s interest rate risk management is the responsibility of the alco committee 
alco committee has established policies and limits to monitor  measure and coordinate the company s sources  uses and pricing of funds 
the company manages the relationship of interest sensitive assets to interest sensitive liabilities and the resulting effect on net interest income 
the company utilizes a simulation model to analyze net interest income sensitivity to movements in interest rates 
the simulation model projects net interest income based on both a rise and fall in interest rates of basis points over a twelve month period 
the model is based on actual repricing dates of interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities 
the model incorporates assumptions regarding the impact of changing interest rates on the prepayment rates of certain assets 
the assumptions are based on nationally published prepayment speeds on given assets when interest rates increase or decrease by basis points or more 
interest rate risk represents the sensitivity of earnings to changes in interest rates 
as interest rates change  the interest income and expense associated with the company s interest sensitive assets and liabilities also change  thereby impacting net interest income  the primary component of the company s earnings 
alco committee utilizes the results of the simulation model and the economic value of equity report to quantify the estimated exposure of net interest income to a sustained change in interest rates 
the company makes use of interest rate contracts to protect its net interest income against changes in interest rates 
at december   the company had an interest rate swap agreement with a notional value of million 
this contract was negotiated to protect the company s balance sheet against a fall or rise in interest rates 
the effect of this instrument is considered in the simulation models 
currently the company s income exposure to changes in interest rates is relatively low 
the company measures this exposure based on a gradual increase or decrease in interest rates of basis points 
given this scenario  the company had  at year end  a slight exposure to rising rates 
the following chart reflects the company s sensitivity to changes in interest rates as of december  numbers are based on the december balance sheet and assume paydowns and maturities of both assets and liabilities are reinvested based on growth assumptions provided by the company 
the same growth and interest rate assumptions are used in the base  up basis points  and down basis points scenarios 
interest rate risk income sensitivity summary interest rate scenario dollars in thousands bp base bp year net interest income change net interest income change net interest income policy limit for basis points bp over months 
the preceding sensitivity analysis is a modeling analysis  which changes quarterly and consists of hypothetical estimates based upon numerous assumptions  including the interest rate levels  shape of the yield curve  prepayments on loans and securities  rates on loans and deposits  reinvestments of paydowns and maturities of loans  investments and deposits  and others 
while assumptions are developed based on the current economic and market conditions  management cannot make any assurances as to the predictive nature of these assumptions  including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change 
as market conditions vary from those assumed in the sensitivity analysis  actual results will differ 
also  the sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions that alco committee might take in responding to or anticipating changes in interest rates
