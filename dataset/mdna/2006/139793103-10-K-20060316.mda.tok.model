overview 
capital bank is a full service state chartered community bank conducting business throughout north carolina 
the bank operates through four north carolina regions  triangle  sandhills  triad and western 
the bank was incorporated on may  and opened its first branch in june of that same year in raleigh 
in  the shareholders of the bank approved the reorganization of the bank into a bank holding company 
in  the company received approval to become a financial holding company 
as of december   the company conducted no business other than holding stock in the bank and each of the trusts 
the bank s business consists principally of attracting deposits from the general public and investing these funds in loans secured by commercial real estate  secured and unsecured commercial and consumer loans  single family residential mortgage loans  and home equity lines 
as a community bank  the bank s profitability depends primarily upon its levels of net interest income  which is the difference between interest income from interest earning assets and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities 
when interest earning assets approximate or exceed interest bearing liabilities  any positive interest rate spread will generate net interest income 
the bank s profitability is also affected by its provision for loan losses  other operating income  and other operating expenses 
other income primarily consists of miscellaneous service charges and atm fees  fees generated from originating mortgage loans that are sold and the increase in cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance 
operating expenses primarily consist of compensation and benefits  occupancy related expenses  advertising  data processing  professional fees  telecommunication and other expenses 
the bank s operations are influenced significantly by local economic conditions and by policies of financial institution regulatory authorities 
the bank s cost of funds is influenced by interest rates on competing investments and by rates offered on similar investments by competing financial institutions in our market area  as well as general market interest rates 
lending activities are affected by the demand for financing  which in turn is affected by the prevailing interest rates 
net income totaled million  or per diluted share in compared to million  or per diluted share in net interest income increased from million in to million in this increase was driven by the impact of rising interest rates  higher earning assets and higher core funding levels 
for the years ended december  and  the net interest margin was and  respectively 
the provision for loan losses decreased million in driven by overall improvement in the credit quality of the loan portfolio  revisions to the bank s allowance estimation methodology  and a reduction in net charge offs during the year ended december  operating expenses increased million  primarily due to higher compensation and benefits expenses 
during  the company focused on the following priorities o strong  sustainable earnings  o a sound credit culture  o disciplined growth in existing or adjacent markets  and o unparalleled customer service by experienced community bankers 
on january   the company completed its previously announced acquisition of st state bancorp 
based on a completed election  proration and allocation procedure  each share of st state bancorp common stock has been automatically converted into either i shares of the company s common stock  rounded to the nearest whole share  ii an amount equal to in cash  plus shares of the company s common stock  rounded to the nearest whole share  or iii shares of the company s common stock  rounded to the nearest whole share  plus an amount equal to in cash 
the company also strengthened its management team during the year with the hiring of mark j 
redmond as chief credit officer in may and the appointment of a 
christine baker as chief financial officer in january following the consummation of the st state bancorp merger 
the company believes it has an experienced management team in place that is dedicated to providing exceptional value to its customers and shareholders 
critical accounting policies and estimates 
the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to the reserve for loan losses  investment and intangible asset values  income taxes  and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements o allowance for loan losses the company records an estimated allowance for loan losses based on known problem loans and estimated risk in the existing loan portfolio 
the allowance calculation takes into account historic write off trends and current market and economic conditions 
if economic conditions were to decline significantly or the financial condition of the bank s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional increases to the allowance may be required 
o investments the company records an investment impairment charge when it believes an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions and associated market values of investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
o valuation allowances the company assesses the need to record a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
the company considers anticipated future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for the valuation allowance which  at this time  it deems not to be necessary 
in the event the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
o goodwill goodwill is not amortized  but is reviewed for potential impairment on an annual basis at the reporting unit level 
identified intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis 
an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
o impairment of long lived assets long lived assets  including identified intangible assets  are evaluated for impairment if events or circumstances indicate a possible impairment 
such evaluations are based on undiscounted cash flow projections 
the disposal of long lived assets is measured based on the lower of the book or fair value less the costs to sell 
results of operations year ended december  compared with year ended december  for the year ended december   the company reported net income of million  or per diluted share  compared to net income of million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  the million increase in net income was the result of an increase in net interest income  primarily due to an improved net interest margin  and a decrease in the loan loss provision  partially offset by a decrease in noninterest income and an increase in noninterest expenses  primarily due to higher salary and benefit expenses 
noninterest income for the year ended december  included a million gain related to the sale of three branch locations and a  loss related to the sale of certain residential mortgage loans 
there were no significant non recurring transactions during the year ended december  net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between total interest income and total interest expense and is the company s principal source of earnings 
the amount of net interest income is determined by the volume of interest earning assets  the level of rates earned on those assets  and the volume and cost of supporting funds 
net interest income increased from million in to million in  an increase of million  or 
the increase is primarily due to increases in market rates on the bank s interest earning assets as its loan yields adjusted upwards with increases in the prime rate and premium amortization slowed on its investment portfolio from lower prepayments 
during  the federal reserve made eight basis point bp upward adjustments in the open market committee s benchmark federal funds rate 
since the bank s loan portfolio adjusts with prime at a faster rate than the time deposit portfolio  the increasing rate environment has had a positive effect on net interest spread and net interest margin 
as time deposits mature and reprice  the margin could be negatively impacted based on pricing competition to retain these deposits 
the increasing rate environment helped push average loan yields up to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  likewise  average time deposit yields increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  net interest spread is the difference between rates earned on interest earning assets and the interest paid on deposits and other borrowed funds 
net interest margin is the total of net interest income divided by average earning assets 
average earning assets in were million  up compared to million for the net interest margin was on a fully tax equivalent te basis in  a bp increase from the net interest margin of 
on a te basis  net interest spread was and for and  respectively 
interest income increased in to million from million in this increase is primarily due to the growth in the bank s commercial loan portfolio and increases in overall yield as discussed above 
the average yield on interest earning assets for was  a bp increase from the yield of 
the average loan portfolio as a percentage of earning assets was in  down from the average balances of loans  which had yields of and for and  respectively  decreased from million in to million in the average balance of mortgage loans decreased from million in to million in  primarily due to the sale of million of residential loans in the fourth quarter of the average balances of federal funds and other short term investments increased from million in to million in and the average yield in this category increased bps from to over the same time period as a result of the increase in short term interest rates 
the tax equivalent yield on investment securities increased from in to in this increase reflects new security purchases that provided higher yields in response to the increasing interest rate environment 
interest expense increased in to million from million in average total interest bearing deposits  including savings  interest bearing demand deposits and time deposits increased from million in to million in  largely due to an increase in money market account deposits 
the average rate paid on interest bearing deposits increased bps from in to in in response to the rising interest rate environment 
the average rate on borrowings also increased from in to in this increase reflects the effects of rising interest rates on the bank s variable rate borrowings and the effects of the bank s interest rate swap agreements  which converted portions of the bank s fixed rate long term debt to a floating rate 
we expect the cost of borrowings to increase in as interest rates continue to increase 
interest expense on subordinated debt associated with the company s three trust preferred offerings increased from million in to million in the average outstanding balance of subordinated debt increased slightly from million in to million in  as the company completed the third million trust preferred security offering in late december the average rate on subordinated debt increased bps between and as a result of the changes to the day london interbank offered rate libor  which increased from at the end of december to at the end of december the subordinated debt issues pay interest at varying spreads to libor and interest expense will increase in as a result of the third trust preferred security offering 
the following two tables set forth certain information regarding the company s yield on interest earning assets and cost of interest bearing liabilities and the component changes in net interest income 
the first table reflects the company s effective yield on earning assets and cost of funds 
yields and costs are computed by dividing income or expense for the year by the respective daily average asset or liability balance 
changes in net interest income from year to year can be explained in terms of fluctuations in volume and rate 
the second table presents further information on those changes 
for each category of interest earning asset and interest bearing liability  we have provided information on changes attributable to o changes in volume  which are changes in average volume multiplied by the average rate for the previous period o changes in rates  which are changes in average rate multiplied by the average volume for the previous period o changes in rate volume  which are changes in average rate multiplied by the changes in average volume and o total change  which is the sum of the previous columns average balances  interest earned or paid  and interest yields rates tax equivalent basis dollars in thousands year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  average amount average average amount average average amount average balance earned rate balance earned rate balance earned rate assets loans receivable commercial       consumer       home equity       residential mortgages       total loans       investment securities       federal funds sold and other interest on short term investments    total interest earning assets       cash and due from banks    other assets    allowance for loan losses    total assets    liabilities and equity savings deposits    interest bearing demand deposits       time deposits       total interest bearing deposits       borrowed funds       subordinated debt     repurchase agreements and fed funds purchased    total interest bearing liabilities       non interest bearing deposits    other liabilities    total liabilities    shareholders equity    total liabilities and equity    net interest spread tax equivalent adjustment net interest income and net interest margin    the taxable equivalent basis is computed using a blended federal and state rate of approximately

provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses is the amount charged against earnings for the purpose of establishing an adequate allowance for loan losses 
loan losses are  in turn  charged to this allowance rather than being reported as a direct expense 
for the year ended december   the credit provision for loan losses was  compared to a provision of million for the year ended december   a decrease of approximately million 
the decrease in was primarily due to overall improvement in the credit quality of the loan portfolio  revisions to the bank s estimation methodology  and a reduction in net charge offs during the year ended december  the amount of the allowance for loan losses is established based on management s estimate of the inherent risks associated with lending activities  estimated fair value of collateral  past experience and present indicators such as delinquency rates and current market conditions 
the allowance is regularly reviewed and adjusted  as necessary 
loans of  or more  as well as other loans  are subject to specific review for impairment 
the allowance for loan losses was million and million on december  and  respectively  and represented approximately and of total loans outstanding on those dates 
during and  the company reclassified  and  of the allowance which related to loss exposure on unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit into a separate other liability account 
during the second quarter of  the bank revised its methodology for estimating the allowance for loan losses associated with certain commercial loans greater than  in prior periods  the bank generally used standard percentage allocations based on the assigned risk rating of the commercial loan if the loan was risk rated below a pass credit 
commencing in the second quarter  the bank began estimating a specific allowance for loan losses for these loans 
the bank determines the level of specific allowance based on the facts and circumstances of each loan  including among other factors  payment history  collateral values  guarantor liquidity  and paying ability 
the effect of the revised methodology used in the estimation of the allowance for loan losses for was to reduce the overall amount of loan loss allocation associated with non pass loans greater than  by  for the year ended december  during the fourth quarter of  the bank also revised its methodology for estimating inherent loan losses associated with unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit 
in prior periods  the bank applied a standard percentage allocation to the total amount of unused credit available 
the revised methodology segregates the unused credit into risk categories and incorporates loss probabilities into the development of the loss percentage factors 
the revised methodology used to estimate the contingent liability associated with unfunded loan commitments resulted in a reduction of  to the provision for loan losses for the year ended december  the company also experienced lower loan charge offs during compared to management believes that this was due in part to an overall improvement in delinquencies and favorable developments in the economy

as of december   nonaccrual loans include three unrelated credit relationships with an aggregate balance of million 
the company has established specific loan loss allocations of  for these credits 
the majority of the bank s nonperforming loans are secured by real estate collateral which management believes should mitigate our exposure to losses compared to those loans that are unsecured or collateralized with other types of assets 
other operating income 
other operating income was million and million for years ended december  and  respectively  a decrease of million 
the decrease in other operating income is primarily due to the sale of three branch locations and certain residential mortgage loans during the third quarter of these two transactions resulted in a net gain of million 
excluding these non recurring transactions  noninterest income increased million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to a  improvement in mortgage fees and revenues as a result of higher period over period loan production  a  increase in bank owned life insurance income due to additional purchases in and a  gain on the sale of a real estate parcel 
service charges and other fees decreased by million which are primarily attributable to the three branch locations sold in september total service charges and fees as a percent of the average total deposit base decreased from

in other operating expense 
other operating expense represents the costs of operating the company

other operating expense increased to million in from million in at december  and there were and branches  respectively  and the average number of full time equivalent fte employees during and was and  respectively 
salary and employee benefits expense for the years ended december  and were million and million  respectively 
commission expense increased from  in to  in primarily due to an increase in mortgage production 
the increase in salary and employee benefits is primarily due to an increase of ftes since december   which is consistent with management s intention to maintain adequate staffing levels to meet customer needs and keep pace with expected growth 
incentive compensation increased by million from  in to million in and the company incurred  in severance expenses related to certain executive and senior officers who separated from the company compared to  in occupancy expense increased from million in to million in the increase was primarily a result of lease expenses associated with new branch locations that opened during and additional space needed for expansion of existing departments 
furniture and equipment expense decreased from million in to million in due to no new branches being opened in and lower depreciation expenses 
directors and advisory board expenses increased from  in to million in as a result of revisions to the existing deferred compensation plan and the implementation of a new supplemental retirement plan 
data processing costs increased from million in to million in primarily due to higher transaction volumes 
professional fees decreased from  in to  in  primarily as a result of lower accounting fees  which were higher in as a result of the use of outside consultants in the initial assessment of internal controls 
other expenses remained flat at million in retired director expenses decreased from  in to  in this decrease was offset by increases in travel and entertainment expenses  non deferred loan costs  and sponsorships which increased from   and  respectively  in to   and  respectively  in provision for income taxes 
the company recorded an income tax expense of million in compared to million in the increase in income tax expense is primarily the result of the change in pretax income which increased from million in to million in the overall effective rate decreased from in to in the change in the effective tax rate primarily reflects the addition of nontaxable income as the result of new purchases of bank owned life insurance and an increase in tax exempt interest 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  net interest income 
net interest income increased from million in to million in  an increase of million  or 
the increase during the period is primarily due to increases in market rates on the bank s interest earning assets as its loan yields adjusted upwards with increases in the prime rate and premium amortization slowed on its investment portfolio from lower prepayments 
over the last six months of  the federal reserve made five basis point upward adjustments in the open market committee s benchmark federal funds rate 
in addition  the bank s net interest income was positively affected by a shift in the mix of its earning assets as the bank replaced lower yielding federal funds with higher yielding loans 
average federal funds and short term investments  yielding only in  dropped by million from december  to december  while average loans  yielding in  increased by almost million 
the increase in average loans takes into account the effect of the following two nonrecurring transactions that occurred during the period o the company completed the sale of its northern region branches in warrenton  seaboard and woodland in september in those branch sales  the company sold approximately million of deposits and million of loans  as well as other assets 
the million of deposits sold were comprised of million non interest bearing demand  million of money market  savings and interest checking and million of time deposits 
a pre tax gain of million was recognized on the sale  which is included in non interest income 
o in december  the company sold approximately million of its mortgage loans 
in conjunction with this sale  a loss of  was recorded in non interest income 
a charge off of  associated with these loans was taken in the third quarter of for reserves previously established 
net interest margin is the total of net interest income divided by average earning assets 
average earning assets in were million  up when compared to million for the net interest margin was on a fully tax equivalent basis in  a bp increase from the net interest margin of 
on a te basis  net interest spread was and for and  respectively 
interest income increased in to million from million in this increase is primarily due to the growth in the bank s loan portfolio and increases in overall yield as discussed above 
the average yield on interest earning assets for was  a bp increase from the yield of 
the average loan portfolio as a percentage of earning assets was in  up from the average balances of loans  which had yields of and for and  respectively  increased from million in to million in the average balances of federal funds and other short term investments decreased from million in to million in as these funds were used to fund loan growth  and the average yield in this category increased bps from to over the same time period 
investment yield increased on an te basis from in to in this change reflects increases in market interest rates over the last year as mortgage backed security mbs pay downs have decreased from the prior year due to a decline mortgage prepayments 
increases in mbs payment speeds in the prior year accelerated the amortization of premiums associated with the assets and decreased the investment yield 
interest expense remained relatively flat in compared to interest expense in both years was million 
average total interest bearing deposits  including savings  interest bearing demand deposits and time deposits declined slightly  from million in to million in  largely as a result the sale of three branches which had deposits of million 
in addition  the average rate paid on interest bearing deposits declined bps between and as those customers with time deposits shortened up the terms on those deposits in anticipation of higher future rates 
the average rate on borrowings also declined from in to in this decline in a rising interest rate environment reflects the full year effect of interest rate swap agreements put into effect in july of which converted portions of the bank s fixed rate long term debt to a floating rate 
decreases in interest expense in the areas discussed above were offset by an increase in interest paid on subordinated debt associated with two trust preferred offerings completed in the average outstanding balance of subordinated debt increased year over year from million in to million in  adding an additional  of interest expense as a result of this volume increase 
provision for loan losses 
in and  amounts expensed as loan loss provisions were million and million  respectively 
the allowance for loan losses was million and million on december  and  respectively  and represented approximately and of total loans outstanding on those dates 
during the year  the company reclassified  of the allowance which related to loss exposure on unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit into a separate other liability account 
the company experienced higher loan charge offs during when compared to management believes that this was due in part to a weakened economy and in part to some large credit issues identified in the second quarter of as a result of those credit issues  management engaged two independent credit review firms in the latter part of to perform a detailed analysis of the bank s loan portfolio 
as a result of the review  management identified loans during that period aggregating approximately million that were classified as a loss 
in addition  management significantly increased its internal loan watch list 
during  the company charged off an aggregate of million in loans  net of  in recoveries 
of that amount  million related to five business customer relationships 
during  the company charged off an aggregate of million in loans  net of  in recoveries 
included in the charge offs for was  related to one loan that had been classified as impaired at december  and for which a specific reserve of  had been established at that time 
also as a result of the loan review  the company effected certain changes to try to mitigate such credit losses going forward  including procedural changes in the loan approval and credit review processes  changes in individual lending limits and centralization of the company s lending operations functions into one facility 
the company also added a lender support area where all consumer loans are centrally underwritten and approved 
other operating income 
other operating income was million and million for years ended december  and  respectively  a decrease of million or 
the decrease in other operating income for is primarily attributable to a substantial drop in fee income recorded by the bank s mortgage department as a result of industry wide decreased mortgage refinance business caused by increases in mortgage loan interest rates 
mortgage origination fees fell to million in from the million earned in the twelve month period ended december  securities gains also fell from  during to  during the mortgage revenue and securities gains decline between the two periods was partially offset by two significant non recurring transactions occurring in the third quarter of discussed under net interest income above 
fees associated with deposit accounts remained fairly flat year over year with recorded balances of million in both and the sale of the three mature branches impacted service charges in the latter part of as the sold branches had higher fee income than the newly opened branches 
total service charges and fees as a percent of the average total deposit base increased from 
in to 
in other operating expense

commission expense decreased from million in to  in these commissions are driven largely by mortgage fee income which decreased 
in addition  during the company incurred million in severance expenses related to certain executive and senior officers who separated from the company compared to severance expenses during of only  occupancy expense increased from million in to million in the increase was primarily a result of lease expenses associated with new locations and additional space needed for expansion of existing departments 
furniture and equipment expense increased from million in to million in due to the increase in assets associated with the new locations and general expansion 
telecommunications expense increased from  to  as we added bandwidth for more rapid data communication 
the increased bandwidth was required to implement upgrades in the data processing software from its main data processing supplier 
public relations and advertising costs increased  or  from  to  due to the branch openings and deposit campaign in other expenses decreased from million in to million in the primary cause for the decrease was a  write down in real estate owned made in september of there were no such significant real estate write downs in however  this decrease was partially offset by increases in other areas including increased travel and entertainment expenses from  to  and an increase in franchise taxes from  to  all such increases were a direct result of changes in the business plan of the company  the changing of the footprint of the organization  or expansion of existing departments 
provision for income taxes 
the company recorded an income tax expense of million in compared to  for the increase in income tax expense is primarily the result of a significant increase in pretax net income which increased from million in to million in the overall effective rate adjusted upwards from in to in the rate for reflects the impact of permanent differences such as nontaxable municipal bond interest and bank owned life insurance income on a smaller net income base

credit risk is managed through a number of methods including loan grading of commercial loans  committee approval of larger loans  and class and purpose coding of loans 
management believes that early detection of credit problems through regular contact with the company s customers coupled with consistent reviews of the borrowers financial condition are important factors in overall credit risk management 
management charged off loans totaling million and million  net of recoveries  as uncollectible during and  respectively 
at december  and  the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was and  respectively 
management believes the allowance for loan losses of million at december  provides adequate coverage of the probable inherent losses in the loan portfolio 
investment securities 
investment securities represent the second largest component of earning assets 
the company s securities portfolio consists primarily of debt securities issued by us government agencies  mortgage backed securities issued by fannie mae and freddie mac  highly rated collateralized mortgage obligations cmos and municipal bonds which have been segregated into one of two categories available for sale or held to maturity 
the available for sale classification allows flexibility in the management of interest rate risk  liquidity  and loan portfolio growth while the held to maturity classification protects the balance sheet against market value fluctuations in a rising rate environment 
the company has the positive intent and the ability to hold held to maturity securities until their maturity or prepayment 
securities available for sale are carried at their fair value and the mark to market adjustment was million in net unrealized losses at december  after considering applicable tax benefits  the mark to market adjustment decreased total stockholders equity by million 
future fluctuations in stockholders equity will occur due to changes in the fair values of available for sale securities 
on december  and  the recorded value of investments totaled million and million  respectively 
at december  and  million and million  respectively  of these securities were classified as available for sale and recorded at fair value and million and million  respectively  were classified as held to maturity and recorded at amortized cost 
available for sale securities includes federal home loan bank stock with a fair value of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
factors affecting the growth of the investment securities portfolio include loan growth  the interest rates available for reinvesting maturing securities and changes in the interest rate yield curve 
due to an expected rising interest rate environment  the company may curtail or refrain from the reinvestment of cash flows from its investment portfolio  instead using proceeds to pay off wholesale funding liabilities and deleveraging the balance sheet thereby improving capital ratios but lowering net interest income 
the company may also increase the investment portfolio depending on core deposit growth 
the company has reviewed the investment portfolio and does not believe any of the declines in fair value are other than temporary 
the company anticipates that substantially all of the book value of the investments will be recovered over the life of any securities whose market value is below amortized cost

asset liability management 
asset liability management functions to maximize profitability within established guidelines for interest rate risk  liquidity  and capital adequacy 
measurement and monitoring of liquidity  interest rate risk  and capital adequacy are performed centrally through the board s asset liability management committee  and reported under guidelines established by management  the board of directors and regulators 

see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for information about interest rate risk 
liquidity management involves the ability to meet the cash flow requirements of depositors wanting to withdraw funds or borrowers needing assurance that sufficient funds will be available to meet their credit needs 
to ensure the company is positioned to meet immediate and future cash demands  management relies on internal analysis of its liquidity  knowledge of current economic and market trends and forecasts of future conditions 
regulatory agencies set certain minimum liquidity standards including the setting of a reserve requirement by the federal reserve 
the company must submit weekly reports to the federal reserve to ensure that it meets those requirements 
at december   the company met all of its liquidity requirements 
the company had million in its most liquid assets  cash and cash equivalents at december   excluding million of cash held in escrow by the company s stock transfer agent for payment to st state bancorp shareholders on consummation of the merger transaction 
the company s principal sources of funds are deposits  short term borrowings and capital 
core deposits total deposits less certificates of deposits in the amount of  or more  one of the most stable sources of liquidity  together with equity capital funded million  or  of total assets at december  at december   core deposits and equity capital totaled million  or  of total assets 
the company s liquidity can best be demonstrated by an analysis of its cash flows 
in  the company used a net increase in deposits of million to fund million in net new loan growth and million of additional cash and cash equivalents 
operating activities also provided million of liquidity for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the principal elements of operating activities are net income  increased for significant non cash expenses for the provision for loan losses and depreciation and amortization 
a secondary source of liquidity for the company comes from investing activities  principally the sales of  maturities of  and cash flows from  investment securities 
as of december   the company had less than million of investment securities that mature in the next months  although the mortgage backed securities will have principal reductions and agency securities may be called by the issuer 
during  the company purchased million of investment securities  repayments on mortgage backed securities were million and million of investment securities were sold or called 
additional sources of liquidity are available to the bank through the federal reserve system and through membership in the fhlb system 
as of december   the bank had a maximum borrowing capacity of million through the fhlb of atlanta 
these funds can be made available with various maturities and interest rate structures 
borrowings cannot exceed twenty percent of total assets or twenty times the amount of fhlb stock owned by the borrowing bank 
at december   the bank owned million worth of fhlb stock or percent of its outstanding advances of million 
borrowings are collateralized by a blanket lien by the fhlb on the bank s qualifying assets 
the company also has liquidity from other sources such as federal funds lines  repurchased agreement lines and brokered cds 
these liquidity sources require collateral in the case of repurchase agreements but are generally unsecured or easily utilized by the company

the company s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historic dollars without consideration for changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the rate of inflation has been relatively moderate over the past few years  however  the effect of inflation on interest rates can materially impact bank operations  which rely on the spread between the yield on earning assets and rates paid on deposits and borrowings as the major source of earnings 
operating costs  such as salaries and wages  occupancy and equipment costs  can also be negatively impacted by inflation

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company hopes to reach its strategic financial objectives through the effective management of market risk 
like many financial institutions  the company s most significant market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
the company s primary goal in managing interest rate risk is to minimize the effect that changes in interest rates have on interest income and expense 
this is accomplished through the active management of asset and liability portfolios  which includes the strategic pricing of asset and liability accounts and ensuring a proper maturity combination of assets and liabilities 
the goal of these activities is the development of maturity and repricing opportunities in the company s portfolios of assets and liabilities that will produce consistent net interest income during periods of changing interest rates 
the company s asset liability committee alco  made up of members of management and the board  monitors loan  investment  and liability portfolios to ensure comprehensive management of interest rate risk 
these portfolios are analyzed to ensure proper fixed and variable rate mixes under several interest rate scenarios 
the asset liability management process is intended to accomplish relatively stable net interest margins and assure liquidity by coordinating the amounts  maturities  or repricing opportunities of earning assets  deposits  and borrowed funds 
the alco has the responsibility to determine and achieve the most appropriate volume and combination of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and ensure an adequate level of liquidity and capital  within the context of corporate performance objectives 
the alco also sets policy guidelines and establishes long term strategies with respect to interest rate risk exposure and liquidity 
the alco meets regularly to review the company s interest rate risk and liquidity positions in relation to present and prospective market and business conditions  and adopts balance sheet management strategies intended to ensure that the potential impact of earnings and liquidity as a result of fluctuations in interest rates is within acceptable guidelines 
in  the bank began using financial instruments  commonly known as derivatives  to manage various financial risks 
the derivatives used presently by the bank consist of interest rate swaps and swaptions 
a derivative is a financial instrument that derives its cash flows  and therefore its value  by reference to an underlying instrument  index  or referenced interest rate 
the bank uses derivatives to hedge its interest bearing liabilities 
these hedges resulted in a net increase in net interest income of  in and  in the company anticipates the benefit to net interest income of the swaps and swaptions will decrease in as short term interest rates continue to increase and the hedges will decrease net interest income 
derivative contracts are written in amounts referred to as notional amounts 
notional amounts only provide the basis for calculating payments between counterparties and do not represent amounts to be exchanged between parties and are not a measure of financial risk 
on december   the bank had derivative financial instruments outstanding with notional amounts totaling million 
see notes to consolidated financial statements note derivative financial instruments for additional information 
as a financial institution  most of the company s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
this differs greatly from most commercial and industrial companies balance sheets  which are comprised primarily of fixed assets or inventories 
movements in interest rates and actions of the board of governors of the federal reserve system frb to regulate the availability and cost of credit have a greater effect on a financial institution s profitability than do the effects of higher costs for goods and services 
through its balance sheet management function  which is monitored by the alco  the company believes it is positioned to respond to changing needs for liquidity  changes in interest rates and inflationary trends 
the company utilizes an outside asset liability management advisory firm to help management evaluate interest rate risk and develop asset liability management strategies 
one tool used is a computer simulation model which projects the company s performance under different interest rate scenarios 
analyses are prepared quarterly which evaluate the company s performance in a base strategy that reflects the company s and operating plan 
three interest rate scenarios flat  rising and declining are applied to the base strategy to determine the effect of changing interest rates on net interest income 
the december  analysis indicates that interest rate risk exposure over a twelve month time horizon is within the guidelines established by the board of directors 
the company s interest rate sensitivity is illustrated in the following table 
the company continues to be asset sensitive at december  as its assets reprice faster than its liabilities 
the table reflects rate sensitive positions at december   and is not necessarily indicative of positions on other dates 
the carrying amounts of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities are presented in the periods in which they next reprice to market rates or mature and are aggregated to show the interest rate sensitivity gap 
to reflect anticipated prepayments  certain asset and liability categories are shown in the table using estimated cash flows rather than contractual cash flows

the projected results exclude the impact of the st state bancorp merger transaction 
in the rising rate scenario  which contemplates a bp gradual increase in interest rates over a twelve month period  the company s projected net interest income would improve by million  or 
conversely  the company will see a decline in projected net interest income of million or  if rates gradually decline bps  as is contemplated in the declining rate scenario 
if interest rates were to immediately increase and decrease by bps  respectively  the company s projected net interest income would increase by million and decrease by million  respectively 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the table does not reflect the impact of the hedging strategies mentioned above 
these interest rate hedges  accounted for as fair value hedges  were designed to convert million of long term advances from fixed rates to a variable rate which is reset quarterly based on day libor 
the swaps are collateralized by certain investment securities and mature as follows effective year amount variable rate  libor  libor
