item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company is a manufacturer of pet plastic containers for food and beverages 
approximately of the company s revenues were generated in the united states  with the remainder attributable to its european operations 
during  one customer accounted for approximately of the company s consolidated revenues  while the top ten customers accounted for an aggregate of approximately of the company s consolidated revenues 
approximately of the company s sales relate to conventional pet containers which are primarily used for carbonated soft drinks and bottled water 
these products generally carry low profit margins 
profitability is driven principally by price  volume and maintaining efficient manufacturing operations 
in recent years  the largest growth within conventional products has come from bottled water 
the company believes that over time  profitability from bottled water may decline as economic factors force some water bottlers into self manufacturing of pet bottles and some smaller water bottlers out of business 
the company does not expect appreciable growth in the carbonated soft drink market in the near term due to consumer preference for healthier beverages 
in addition to the conventional product lines  the company is also a producer of higher margin custom products that are used in such packaging applications as hot filled beverages  food  beer and flavored alcoholic beverages  most of which require containers with special performance characteristics 
approximately of the company s sales relate to custom pet containers 
critical success factors in the custom pet market include technology  design capabilities and expertise with specialized equipment 
the technology required to produce certain types of custom products is commonly available  which has resulted in increased competition and lower margins for such products 
in recent years  the pet packaging industry has experienced very competitive pricing conditions 
pricing pressure continues especially for custom products that can be produced with commercially available technology 
pricing pressure for conventional products has been minimal this year and domestic conventional capacity continues to show signs of tightening 
many of the company s largest contracts are scheduled to expire over the next few years 
the company s main contract with pepsico  its largest customer  expires on december  in negotiations with certain customers for the continuation and the extension of supply agreements  predominantly in the custom segment  the company has agreed to price concessions 
these concessions have been partially offset by price increases and other provisions obtained under new contracts for conventional business that renewed since the company implemented its strategic value initiative in the fourth quarter of the net negative impact of contractual pricing is currently expected to be approximately million in under its strategic value initiative  the company has presented to renewing conventional customers a new contract structure with integrated terms and conditions  service level options  and pricing components that give our customers the flexibility to choose from a set of service options that are priced as additions to a negotiated base product price 
in addition to the revenue gain from higher prices under the new contracts  the company believes the new structure will enable it to reduce costs by limiting services it must provide when a customer chooses a lower price that does not entitle the customer to such services 
the company believes that it will continue to face two significant sources of pricing pressure 
the first source is customer consolidation 
when smaller customers combine or are acquired by larger customers or customers purchase through buying cooperatives and thereby aggregate purchasing power  the profitability of constar s business with these smaller customers tends to decline 
in addition  as customers grow through acquisitions  they acquire more leverage in contract negotiations 
the company will negotiate aggressively and seek to minimize the impact of customer consolidation 
the second source of pricing pressure is contractual provisions that permit customers to terminate contracts if the customer receives an offer from another manufacturer that the company chooses not to match 
the company is continuing to seek to remove these provisions in all new contracts and contract renewals 

table of contents constar is currently attempting to improve its margins by improving customer and product mix  increasing prices on certain products  maximizing utilization rates  updating existing facilities and instituting cost reduction programs and efficiency improvements 
if the company is unsuccessful in these efforts  its ability to maintain its current operating margins will be adversely affected 
constar has recently operated at high utilization rates  however the company does not intend to invest in additional capacity in the low margin conventional business until overall margins and prices increase to levels where acceptable returns can be achieved and sustained 
the primary raw material and component cost of the company s products is pet resin  which is a commodity available globally 
the price of pet resin is subject to frequent fluctuations as a result of raw material costs  overseas markets  pet production capacity and seasonal demand 
following a period of dramatic price increases  the price of pet resin began to decline in the beginning of the third quarter but sharply increased as a result of recent hurricanes in the southeast united states that limited raw material production capacity and resin availability 
the company has been able to secure sufficient pet resin to date to service customer needs 
constar is one of the largest purchasers of pet resin in north america  which it believes provides it with negotiating leverage necessary to obtain pet resin on favorable terms 
however  higher resin prices may impact the demand for pet packaging where customers have a choice between pet and other forms of packaging 
substantially all of the company s sales are made pursuant to contracts that allow for the pass through of changes in the price of pet resin to its customers with equivalent selling price changes 
period to period comparisons of gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of sales may not be meaningful indicators of actual performance  because the effects of the pass through mechanisms are affected by the magnitude and timing of resin price changes 
pet bottle manufacturing is capital intensive  requiring both specialized production equipment and significant support infrastructure for power  high pressure air and resin handling 
constar believes that the introduction of new pet technologies has created significant opportunities for the conversion of glass containers to pet containers for bottled teas  beer  flavored alcoholic beverages and food applications 
these conversion opportunities will require significant capital expenditures to obtain the appropriate production equipment 
the company s credit agreement imposes maximum capital expenditures of million in  million in and million in these capital expenditure covenants allow for the carry forward of a certain amount of spending below covenant levels in previous periods 
in constar spent million  allowing million to carry over to if constar is awarded a significant volume of conversions over a short period of time  it may have to obtain waivers or amendments to these covenants which it may not be able to obtain on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
in order to capture economies of scale  the company favors large plants located within a few hours driving distance of the major markets that it services 
normally  this proximity helps the company to minimize freight costs 
however  in order to meet its customers requirements  the company must sometimes manufacture products out of territory at a plant that is not its closest plant to the necessary delivery location 
this increases freight costs  and depending on the circumstances  the company may be required to bear the additional freight costs 
these out of territory freight costs tend to peak during the second and third quarters  when the company s customers requirements are at their highest 
in addition  any general increase in freight rates may impact the company s margins to the extent that its contracts do not permit it to pass the increase through to its customers 
during the third quarter  the company s operation located in the united kingdom reported financial results below expectations 
these results were due to a sales volume shortfall and excess costs incurred to service these reduced volumes 
the company s operations located in holland also reported financial results below expectations and a reduction from the previous quarter s results 
these shortfalls are more directly related to competitive activities and weak customer demand 
while the company implemented key initiatives during the second quarter to improve these operating results  neither of these facilities has been able to achieve its forecasted operating targets 
as a result of the shortfall in performance and results below revised expectations  the company performed an interim impairment test as of september  in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the impairment test was based on the 
table of contents undiscounted cash flows from the asset base as compared to the carrying value of those assets 
based on these reduced earnings expectations  the undiscounted cash flows of both the uk and holland operations were insufficient to recover the carrying value of these assets over the remaining useful lives 
the company then calculated the fair value of the assets of both operations based on discounted projected net cash flows and recorded a fixed asset impairment loss of million for these operations to write the asset carrying values down to fair value 
the total loss of million is based on a write down of million for the uk operation and million for the holland facility 
the company reviewed the financial results of the uk and holland operations for the fourth quarter of and no additional asset impairment was required 
the company will continue to monitor closely these operations and the different risks that may impact future carrying value of these assets
