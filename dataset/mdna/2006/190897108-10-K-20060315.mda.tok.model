item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary the company is a financial holding company that offers a broad array of financial service products to its target market of small and medium sized businesses and high net worth individuals 
our operating segments include our commercial banking franchise  colorado business bank and arizona business bank  investment banking services  investment advisory and trust services  and insurance services 
earnings are derived primarily from our net interest income  which is interest income less interest expense  and our noninterest income earned from our fee based business lines and banking service fees  offset by noninterest expense 
as the majority of our assets are interest earning and our liabilities are interest bearing  changes in interest rates impact our net interest margin  the largest component of our operating revenue which is defined as net interest income plus non interest income 
we manage our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on our operating results 
we also have focused on reducing our dependency on our net interest margin by increasing our noninterest income 
our company has focused on developing an organization with personnel  management systems and products that will allow us to compete effectively and position us for growth 
the cost of this process relative to our size has been high 
in addition  we have operated with excess capacity during the start up phases of various projects 
as a result  relatively high levels of non interest expense have adversely affected our earnings over the past several years 
salaries and employee benefits comprised most of this overhead category 
however  we believe that our compensation levels have allowed us to recruit and retain a highly qualified management team capable of implementing our business strategies 
we believe our compensation policies  which include the granting of options to purchase common stock to many employees and the offering of an employee stock purchase plan  have highly motivated our employees and enhanced our ability to maintain customer loyalty and generate earnings 
for additional discussion on options granted to employees  see notes and to our consolidated financial statements 
from december   the first complete fiscal year under the current management team  to december   our organization has grown from a bank holding company with two bank locations and total assets of million to a financial services holding company with bank locations  five fee based businesses and total assets of billion 
certain key metrics of our operating segments as of december  and are as follows colorado arizona investment investment corporate business business banking advisory support and bank bank services trust services insurance other consolidated in thousands  except per share data net income loss diluted earnings per share loss total assets net income loss diluted earnings per share loss total assets noted below are some of the significant financial performance measures and operational accomplishments for our commercial banking franchise had strong growth in both net income and earnings per share during as compared to our loan portfolio  the largest interest earning asset base of the company  increased in the increase was driven primarily by our arizona operations  where we continue to experience significant growth 
loan growth for in the arizona market accounted for of the company s total increase 
the company opened two de novo banks in arizona during  one of which surpassed break even during the year 
the colorado bank  which had a slow start in  saw loan growth accelerate throughout the latter half of the year  ending with a annualized increase in the fourth quarter 
investment banking services recognized a decrease in its earnings performance during  primarily due to an extraordinary level of activity in however  the earnings performance in is in line with management s expectations for this segment 
investment advisory and trust services  while a less significant part of our overall operations  continues to recognize increases in revenue production 
during  the company realigned the operational structure of the segment and hired a chief operating officer 
the realignment and addition of new staff  while critical to the future success of the segment  reduced the bottom line contribution of the segment in as compared to our insurance segment had a slight decrease in net income and earnings per share during  primarily due to an investment in new producers  who typically take months to build a book of business and reach break even 
corporate support and other had a significant increase in its net loss and loss per share  primarily due to the addition of million in junior subordinated debentures in may  which increased interest expense year over year 
an increase in interest rates has also increased our interest expense  as all of our junior subordinated debentures are issued as variable rate instruments 
on june   the company retired million in junior subordinated debentures that effectively bore a variable rate of month libor plus 
on august   the company raised another million of junior subordinated debentures at a variable rate of month libor plus 
the differential in the spread over libor will result in an annual savings of million 
during  we completed the consolidation and relocation of our information technology and operational groups into a new location 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this form k beginning on page f for a discussion of the segments included in our principal activities and for certain financial information for each segment  see note to our consolidated financial statements

critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
in making those critical accounting estimates  we are required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate 
different estimates we could reasonably have used  or changes in the assumptions that could occur  could have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting policy that requires subjective estimates in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the allowance for loan losses is evaluated on a regular basis by management and is based upon management s periodic review of the collectibilty of loans in light of historical experience  the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available 
we maintain a loan review program independent of the lending function that is designed to reduce and control risk in the lending function 
it includes the monitoring of lending activities with respect to underwriting and processing new loans  preventing insider abuse  and timely follow up and corrective action for loans showing signs of deterioration in quality 
we also have a systematic process to evaluate individual loans and pools of loans within our loan portfolio 
we maintain a loan grading system whereby each loan is assigned a grade between and  with representing the highest quality credit  representing a non accrual loan where collection or liquidation in full is highly questionable and improbable  and representing a loss that has been or will be charged off 
grades are assigned based upon the degree of risk associated with repayment of a loan in the normal course of business pursuant to the original terms 
loans above a certain dollar amount that are adversely graded are reported to the loan committee and the chief credit officer along with current financial information  a collateral analysis and an action plan 
individual loans that are deemed to be impaired are evaluated in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
in determining the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses  we analyze the various components of the loan portfolio  including all significant credits  on an individual basis 
when analyzing the adequacy  we segment the loan portfolio into components with similar characteristics  such as risk classification  past due status  type of loan  industry or collateral 
possible factors that may impact the allowance for loan losses include  but are not limited to changes in lending policies and procedures  including underwriting standards as well as collection  charge off and recovery practices 
changes in national and local economic and business conditions and developments  including the condition of various market segments 
changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio 
changes in the experience  ability  and depth of lending management and staff 
changes in the trend of the volume and severity of past due and classified loans  and trends in the volume of non accrual loans  troubled debt restructurings  and other loan modifications 
the existence and effect of any concentrations of credit  and changes in the level of such concentrations 
the effect of external factors such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements on the level of estimated credit losses in the current portfolio 
refer to the provision and allowance for loan losses section under results of operations below for further discussion on management s methodology 
recoverability of goodwill sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  requires that we evaluate on an annual basis or whenever events occur which may indicate possible impairment whether any portion of our recorded goodwill is impaired 
the recoverability of goodwill is a critical accounting policy that requires subjective estimates in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
goodwill impairment is determined by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount  goodwill is considered impaired 
we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using market multiples of comparable entities  including recent transactions  or a combination of market multiples and a discounted cash flow methodology 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires a high degree of subjective management assumption 
discounted cash flow valuation models are utilized that incorporate such variables as revenue growth rates  expense trends  discount rates and terminal values 
based upon an evaluation of key data and market factors  management selects from a range the specific variables to be incorporated into the valuation model 
we conducted our annual evaluation of our reporting units as of december  as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  for the period ending december  the estimated fair value of all reporting units exceeded their carrying values and goodwill impairment was not deemed to exist 
the fair value calculations were also tested for sensitivity to reflect reasonable variations  including keeping all other variables constant and reducing projected revenue growth and projected cost savings 
using this sensitivity approach  there was no impairment identified in any reporting unit 
we also have other policies that we consider to be key accounting policies  however  these policies  which are disclosed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  do not meet the definition of critical accounting policies because they do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment 
sfas r requires that the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions  including grants of employee stock options  be recognized in financial statements 
that cost will be measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
sfas r covers a wide range of share based compensation arrangements including stock options  restricted share plans  performance based awards  share appreciation rights and employee stock purchase plans 
sfas r specifies that the fair value of an employee stock option must be based on an observable market price of an option with the same or similar terms and conditions if one is available or  if an observable market price is not available  the fair value must be estimated using a valuation technique that is applied in a manner consistent with the fair value measurement objective and the other requirements of the statement  is based on established principles of financial economic theory and generally applied to that field  and reflects all substantive characteristics of the instrument 
sfas r permits entities to use any option pricing model that meets the fair value objective in the statement 
in march  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 topic share based payment sab which was effective immediately 
sab addresses the interaction between sfas r and certain sec rules and regulations and provides views regarding the valuation of share based payment arrangements for public companies 
the company does not expect the requirements of sab to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
in april  the sec amended rule a of regulation s x regarding the compliance date for sfas r 
the amendment postpones the effective date for the company to january  as of the effective date  the company will apply sfas r using a modified version of prospective application 
under that transition method  compensation cost is recognized for all awards granted after the required effective date and to awards modified  cancelled  or repurchased after that date and the portion of prior awards for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered  based on the grant date fair value of those awards calculated for either recognition or pro forma disclosures under sfas currently  the company offers several stock option plans and an employee stock purchase plan that will be impacted by this statement 
based on the non vested stock based compensation awards outstanding as of december   the company estimates the quantitative impact of sfas r on a pre tax basis will be  the future impact of sfas r will depend upon various factors  among them being the company s issuance of additional stock based compensation awards  cancellations and modifications of existing awards  and the cost of the company s employee stock purchase plan which is dependent on the company s stock price and employee participation

lending activities general 
we provide a broad range of commercial and retail lending services  including commercial loans  commercial and residential real estate construction loans  commercial and residential real estate mortgage loans  consumer loans  revolving lines of credit  and equipment lease financing 
our primary lending focus is commercial and real estate lending to small and medium sized businesses with annual sales of million to million  and businesses and individuals with borrowing requirements of  to million 
at december   substantially all of our outstanding loans were to customers within colorado and arizona 
interest rates charged on loans vary with the degree of risk  maturity  underwriting and servicing costs  principal amount  and extent of other banking relationships with the customer  and are further subject to competitive pressures  money market rates  availability of funds  and government regulations 
see net interest income for an analysis of the interest rates on our loans 
credit procedures and review 
we address credit risk through internal credit policies and procedures  including underwriting criteria  officer and customer lending limits  a multi layered loan approval process for larger loans  periodic document examination  justification for any exceptions to credit policies  loan review and concentration monitoring 
in addition  we provide ongoing loan officer training and review 
we have a continuous loan review process designed to promote early identification of credit quality problems  assisted by a dedicated chief credit officer 
during  the company established a new senior credit officer position to oversee the real estate portfolio 
all loan officers are charged with the responsibility of reviewing  no less frequently than monthly  all past due loans in their respective portfolios 
in addition  each of the loan officers establishes a watch list of loans to be reviewed by the boards of directors of the bank and cobiz 
the loan portfolio is also monitored regularly by a loan review officer who reports to the president of the company but submits reports directly to the audit committee of the boards of directors 
composition of loan portfolio 
the following table sets forth the composition of our loan portfolio at the dates indicated 
at december  in thousands amount amount amount amount amount commercial real estate mortgage real estate construction consumer other loans less allowance for loan losses net loans our continued penetration into the arizona market and the addition of new senior level bankers in both colorado and arizona have allowed our loan portfolio net to increase by million in and million in the overall growth in the loan portfolio during and was comprised primarily of million and million in real estate mortgage loans  respectively and million and million in commercial loans  respectively 
under federal law  the aggregate amount of loans we can make to one borrower is generally limited to of our unimpaired capital  surplus  undivided profits and allowance for loan losses 
at december   our individual legal lending limit was million 
our board of directors has established an internal lending limit of million for normal credit extensions and million for the highest rated credit types 
to accommodate customers whose financing needs exceed our internal lending limits and to address portfolio concentration concerns  we sell loan participations to outside participants 
at december  and  the outstanding balances of loan participations sold by us were million and million  respectively 
we have retained servicing rights on all loan participations sold 
at december  and  we had loan participations purchased from other banks totaling million and million  respectively 
we use the same analysis in deciding whether or not to purchase a participation in a loan as we would in deciding whether to originate the same loan 
due to the nature of our business as a commercial banking institution  our lending relationships are typically larger than those of a retail bank 
the following table describes the number of relationships and the percentage of the dollar value of the loan portfolio by the size of the credit relationship 
the majority of the loan relationships exceeding million are in our real estate and construction portfolios 
number of of number of of number of of credit relationships relationships loan portfolio relationships loan portfolio relationships loan portfolio greater than million million to million million to million million to million less than million in the ordinary course of business  we enter into various types of transactions that include commitments to extend credit 
we apply the same credit standards to these commitments as we apply to our other lending activities and have included these commitments in our lending risk evaluations 
our exposure to credit loss under commitments to extend credit is represented by the amount of these commitments 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on our commitments 
commercial loans 
commercial lending consists of loans to small and medium sized businesses in a wide variety of industries 
the bank s areas of emphasis in commercial lending include  but are not limited to  loans to wholesalers  manufacturers  construction and business services companies 
we provide a broad range of commercial loans  including lines of credit for working capital purposes and term loans for the acquisition of equipment and other purposes 
commercial loans are generally collateralized by inventory  accounts receivable  equipment  real estate and other commercial assets and may be supported by other credit enhancements such as personal guarantees 
however  where warranted by the overall financial condition of the borrower  loans may be unsecured and based on the cash flow of the business 
terms of commercial loans generally range from one to five years  and the majority of such loans have floating interest rates 
the following table summarizes the company s commercial loan portfolio  segregated by standard industrial classification code sic 
of commercial of commercial of commercial commercial loans by sic code in thousands balance loan portfolio balance loan portfolio balance loan portfolio finance and insurance services construction wholesale trade manufacturing retail trade all other real estate mortgage loans 
real estate mortgage loans include various types of loans for which we hold real property as collateral 
we generally restrict commercial real estate lending activity to owner occupied properties or to investor properties that are owned by customers with which we have a current banking relationship 
we make commercial real estate loans at both fixed and floating interest rates  with maturities generally ranging from five to years 
the bank s underwriting standards generally require that a commercial real estate loan not exceed of the appraised value of the property securing the loan 
in addition  we originate small business administration loans sba on owner occupied properties with maturities of up to years in which the sba allows for financing of up to of the project cost and takes a security position that is subordinated to us  as well as us department of agriculture usda rural development loans 
as of december   approximately of our outstanding loans were guaranteed by the sba and were guaranteed by the usda 
we also originate residential mortgage loans on a limited basis as a service to our preferred customers 
the primary risks of real estate mortgage loans include the borrower s inability to pay  material decreases in the value of the real estate that is being held as collateral and significant increases in interest rates  which may make the real estate mortgage loan unprofitable 
we do not actively seek permanent mortgage loans for our own portfolio  but  rather  syndicate such loans to other financial institutions 
however  for those permanent mortgage loans that are extended  we attempt to apply conservative loan to value ratios and obtain personal guarantees and generally require a strong history of debt servicing capability and fully amortized terms of years or less

we originate loans to finance construction projects involving one to four family residences 
we provide financing to residential developers that we believe have demonstrated a favorable record of accurately projecting completion dates and budgeting expenses 
we provide loans for the construction of both pre sold projects and projects built prior to the location of a specific buyer  although loans for projects built prior to the identification of a specific buyer are provided on a more selective basis 
residential construction loans are due upon the sale of the completed project and are generally collateralized by first liens on the real estate and have floating interest rates 
in addition  these loans are generally secured by personal guarantees to provide an additional source of repayment 
we generally require a permanent financing commitment be in place before we make a residential construction loan 
moreover  we generally monitor construction draws monthly and inspect property to ensure that construction is progressing as projected 
our underwriting standards generally require that the principal amount of a speculative loan be no more than of the appraised value of the completed construction project  and of pre sold projects 
values are determined primarily by approved independent appraisers 
we also originate loans to finance the construction of multi family  office  industrial  retail and tax credit projects 
these projects are predominantly owned by the user of the property  or are sponsored by financially strong developers  who maintain an ongoing banking relationship with us 
our underwriting standards generally require that the principal amount of these loans be no more than of the appraised value 
values are determined primarily by approved independent appraisers 
we selectively provide loans for the acquisition and development of land for residential building projects by financially strong developers who maintain an ongoing banking relationship with us 
for this category of loans  our underwriting standards generally require that the principal amount of these loans be no more than of the appraised value 
values are determined primarily by approved independent appraisers 
consumer loans 
we provide a broad range of consumer loans to customers  including personal lines of credit  home equity loans and automobile loans 
in order to improve customer service  continuity and customer retention  the same loan officer often services the banking relationships of both the business and business owners or management 
nonperforming assets our nonperforming assets consist of nonaccrual loans  restructured loans  past due loans more than days  and other real estate owned 
nonaccrual loans are those loans for which the accrual of interest has been discontinued 
impaired loans are defined as loans for which  based on current information and events  it is probable that the company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement all of which were on a non accrual basis 
the following table sets forth information with respect to these assets at the dates indicated 
at december  in thousands nonperforming loans loans days or more delinquent and still accruing interest nonaccrual loans total nonperforming loans repossessed assets total nonperforming assets allowance for loan losses ratio of nonperforming assets to total assets ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans ratio of allowance for loan losses to total loans ratio of allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans accrual of interest is discontinued on a loan when management believes  after considering economic and business conditions and collection efforts  that the borrower s financial condition is such that the collection of interest is doubtful 
a delinquent loan is generally placed on nonaccrual status when it becomes days past due 
when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status  all accrued and unpaid interest on the loan is reversed and deducted from earnings as a reduction of reported interest income 
no additional interest is accrued on the loan balance until the collection of both principal and interest becomes reasonably certain 
when the issues relating to a nonaccrual loan are finally resolved  there may ultimately be an actual write down or charge off of the principal balance of the loan  which may necessitate additional charges to earnings 
restructured loans are those for which concessions  including the reduction of interest rates below a rate otherwise available to the borrower  or the deferral of interest or principal  have been granted due to the borrower s weakened financial condition 
interest on restructured loans is accrued at the restructured rates when it is anticipated that no loss of original principal will occur 
the additional interest income that would have been recognized for the years ended december    and if our nonaccrual and restructured loans had been current in accordance with their original terms  and the interest income on nonaccrual and restructured loans actually included in our net income for such periods  was not material 
repossessed assets include vehicles and other commercial assets acquired under agreements with delinquent borrowers and are carried at the lesser of fair market value less anticipated selling costs or the balance of the related loan 
in addition to the nonperforming assets described above  at december   we had loan relationships considered by management to be potential problem loans  with outstanding principal totaling approximately million 
a potential problem loan is one as to which management has concerns about the borrower s future performance under the terms of the loan contract 
for our protection  management monitors these loans closely 
these loans are current as to the principal and interest and  accordingly  are not included in the nonperforming asset categories 
however  further deterioration may result in the loan being classified as nonperforming 
the level of potential problem loans is factored into the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
analysis of allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s recognition of the risks of extending credit and its evaluation of the quality of the loan portfolio 
the allowance is maintained to provide for probable credit losses related to specifically identified loans and for losses inherent in the loan portfolio that have been incurred as of the balance sheet date 
the allowance is based on various factors affecting the loan portfolio  including a review of problem loans  business conditions  historical loss experience  evaluation of the quality of the underlying collateral  and holding and disposal costs 
the allowance is increased by additional charges to operating income and reduced by loans charged off  net of recoveries 
the following table sets forth information regarding changes in our allowance for loan losses for the periods indicated 
for the year ended december  in thousands balance of allowance for loan losses at beginning of period charge offs commercial real estate mortgage consumer other total charge offs recoveries commercial real estate mortgage consumer other total recoveries net charge offs provisions for loan losses charged to operations balance of allowance for loan losses at end of period ratio of net charge offs to average loans average loans outstanding during the period additions to the allowance for loan losses  which are charged as expenses on our income statement  are made periodically to maintain the allowance at the appropriate level  based on our analysis of the potential risk in the loan portfolio 
loans charged off  net of amounts recovered from such loans  reduce the allowance for loan losses 
the amount of the allowance is a function of the levels of loans outstanding  the level of non performing loans  historical loan loss experience  the amount of loan losses actually charged against the reserve during a given period  and current economic conditions 
federal regulatory agencies  as part of their examination process  review our loans and allowance for loan losses 
we believe that our allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover anticipated loan losses 
however  management may determine a need to increase the allowance for loan losses  or regulators  when reviewing the bank s loan portfolio in the future  may request the bank increase such allowance 
either of these events could adversely affect our earnings 
further  there can be no assurance that our actual loan losses will not exceed the allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses consists of three elements i specific reserves determined in accordance with sfas no 
accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  based on probable losses on specific loans  ii general reserves determined in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for contingencies based on historical loan loss experience adjusted for other qualitative risk factors both internal and external to the company  and iii unallocated reserves 
specific reserves 
the company continuously evaluates its reserve for loan losses to maintain an adequate level to absorb loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
reserves on loans identified as impaired are based on discounted expected cash flows using the loan s initial effective interest rate  the observable market value of the loan or the fair value of the collateral for certain collateral dependent loans 
loans are considered to be impaired in accordance with the provisions of sfas  when it is probable that all amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms will not be collected 
factors contributing to the determination of specific reserves include the financial condition of the borrower  changes in the value of pledged collateral and general economic conditions 
general reserves 
general reserves are considered part of the allocated portion of the allowance 
we use a comprehensive loan grading process for our loan portfolios 
based on this process  we assign a loss factor to each pool of graded loans 
we use a combination of our long term average loss experience and external loss data in determining the appropriate loss factor 
this estimate represents the potential unconfirmed losses within the portfolio 
the historical estimation for each loan pool is then adjusted to account for factors  which may cause future losses to deviate from historical levels 
factors considered by management that are likely to cause estimated credit losses associated with our current portfolio to differ from historical loss experience include changes in national and local economic and business conditions and developments  changes in lending policies and procedures  including underwriting standards and collection  charge off  and recovery practices  changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio  changes in the experience  ability  and depth of lending management and staff  changes in the trend of the volume and severity of past due loans  and trends in the volume of non accrual loans  troubled debt restructurings  and other loan modifications  changes in the quality of the bank s loan review system and the degree of oversight by the bank s board of directors  the existence and effect of any concentrations of credit  and changes in the level of such concentrations  the impact of competition on loan structuring and pricing  the impact of rising interest rates on portfolio risk  the effect of external factors  such as legal and regulatory requirements  on the level of estimated credit losses in the bank s current portfolio 
the company has an internal loan review department that is independent of the lending function to challenge and corroborate the loan grading system and provide additional analysis in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
in addition to the allocated reserve for graded loans  a portion of the allowance is determined by segmenting the portfolio into product groupings with similar risk characteristics 
this supplemental portion of the allowance includes our judgmental consideration of any additional amounts necessary for subjective factors such as economic uncertainties and excess concentration risks 
concentration risk limits have been established for  among other things  certain industry concentrations  large balance and highly leveraged credit relationships that exceed specified risk grades  and loans originated with policy exceptions that exceed specified risk grades 
management evaluates the degree of risk that each one of these components has on the quality of the loan portfolio on a quarterly basis 
while management utilizes its best judgment and information available  the ultimate adequacy of the allowance is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond the company s control  including the performance of our loan portfolio  the economy  changes in interest rates and the view of the regulatory authorities toward loan classifications 
unallocated reserves 
the unallocated reserve  which is judgmentally determined  is maintained to recognize the imprecision in estimating and measuring loss when evaluating reserves for individual loans or pools of loans 
the methodology used in the periodic review of reserve adequacy  which is performed at least quarterly  is designed to be dynamic and responsive to changes in actual and expected credit losses 
these changes are reflected in both the general and unallocated reserves 
the historical loss ratios and estimated risk factors related to segmenting our loan portfolio  which are key considerations in this analysis  are updated quarterly and are weighted more heavily for recent economic conditions 
the review of reserve adequacy is performed by executive management and presented to the audit committee quarterly for its review and consideration 
the table below provides an allocation of the year end allowance for loan losses by loan type  however  allocation of a portion of the allowance to one category of loans does not preclude its availability to absorb losses in other categories at december  loans in loans in loans in loans in loans in category as a category as a category as a category as a category as a amount of of total amount of of total amount of of total amount of of total amount of of total in thousands allowance gross loans allowance gross loans allowance gross loans allowance gross loans allowance gross loans commercial real estate mortgage real estate construction consumer direct financing leases unallocated total we believe that any allocation of the allowance into categories creates an appearance of precision that does not exist 
the allocation table should not be interpreted as an indication of the specific amounts  by loan classification  to be charged to the allowance 
we believe that the table is a useful device for assessing the adequacy of the allowance as a whole 
the allowance is utilized as a single unallocated allowance available for all loans 
in  the company adopted a more refined segmentation system that resulted in a majority of the prior unallocated reserve being reallocated into the allowance for commercial loans 
part of the refinement in our segmentation involved assigning increased reserve factors to higher risk lending activities  such as leverage financings  certain loans lacking personal guarantees  land acquisition and development loans  or speculative real estate loans 
in addition  management modified reserve percentages to reflect the uncertainty of customers sensitive to increases in petroleum prices  a potential housing market slowdown  and rising interest rates 
overall during  economic conditions continued to improve and the company continued to experience positive trends in several credit quality measures 
as a result  the level of allowance for loan losses to total loans was decreased through a reduction in the provision for loan losses 
the company recorded provision for loan losses of million in versus million in net charge offs for were  or basis points of average loans 
this translated to an allowance for loan losses equal to of total loans as of december   down from as of december  investments our investment portfolio is comprised primarily of securities rated aaa or better by various nationally recognized rating agencies  with the majority of the portfolio either maturing or repricing within a one to five year period 
our practice is to purchase primarily us treasury and us government agency backed securities 
our investment strategies are reviewed in monthly meetings of the asset and liability management committee 
our mortgage backed securities are typically classified as available for sale 
our goals with respect to our securities portfolio are to maximize safety and soundness 
provide adequate liquidity 
maximize rate of return within the constraints of applicable liquidity requirements 
complement asset liability management strategies 
the following table sets forth the book value of the securities in our investment portfolio by type at the dates indicated 
at december  in thousands mortgage backed securities us government agencies trust preferred securities obligations of states and political subdivisions other investments total in  the decrease in the investment portfolio was due to efforts to reduce our overall asset sensitivity by deleveraging the overall investment portfolio 
the company had previously increased the investment portfolio during with adjustable rate mortgage backed securities as a method to manage liquidity and risk as well as to provide interest income 
during  our net unrealized loss on our available for sale securities  increased million to million at december   compared to million at december  market changes in interest rates can result in fluctuations in the market price of securities resulting in temporary unrealized losses 
these temporary losses are primarily due to increases in interest rates related to our mortgage backed securities portfolio 
these securities are all highly rated  investment grade securities primarily issued by government sponsored organizations 
the unrealized losses are primarily due to increases in interest rates on these securities since they were originally purchased 
the fair value of these securities is expected to recover as the securities approach their stated maturity or repricing date 
the company does not believe that any of the unrealized losses are a result of the credit quality of the issuing organizations

at december  in thousands goodwill intangible assets bank owned life insurance premises and equipment  net accrued interest receivable deferred income taxes other total assets the increases in goodwill during and of million and million  respectively  were related to additional purchase price consideration on acmg and gmb under the terms of earn out agreements 
the earn out payments are to the former owners of those companies 
bank owned life insurance increased million to million at december   from million at december  bank owned life insurance increased million to million at december   from million at december  the increases were related to the purchase of a series of single premium policies and growth in the cash surrender value of all policies 
earnings from these policies  by way of increases in their cash surrender value  is intended to offset future costs of employee benefits 
deposits our primary source of funds has historically been customer deposits 
we offer a variety of accounts for depositors  which are designed to attract both short and long term deposits 
these accounts include certificates of deposit  savings accounts  money market accounts  checking and negotiable order of withdrawal accounts  and individual retirement accounts 
at december   million  or  of our deposits were noninterest bearing deposits 
we believe we receive a large amount of noninterest bearing deposits because we provide customers with the option of paying for treasury management services in cash or by maintaining additional noninterest bearing account balances 
however  since proposed changes in united states legislation would allow for the payment of interest on commercial accounts  there can be no assurance we will be able to continue to maintain such a high level of noninterest bearing deposits 
interest bearing accounts earn interest at rates based on competitive market factors and our desire to increase or decrease certain types of maturities or deposits 
as of december   the company had million in brokered deposits

the inclusion of the operations of fdl and acmg  which were acquired in april  and were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting  contributed to the increases in non interest income and non interest expense for the comparable periods of and as there was a full months of operations in and only nine months of operations in in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the company s financial statements prior to the acquisition dates have not been restated to reflect the assets or earnings of fdl and acmg 
earnings performance 
net earnings available to common shareholders were million for the year ended december   compared with million for  and million for the increase in over was primarily due to an increase in net interest income of million after provision for loan losses  offset by a million increase in non interest expense  and a decrease in non interest income of million 
the increase in over was primarily due to an increase in net interest income of million after provision for loan losses  and an increase in non interest income of million  offset by a million increase in non interest expense 
reported earnings per share on a fully diluted basis for were  versus for and for net interest income 
the largest component of our net income is our net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income  principally from loans and investment securities  and interest expense  principally on customer deposits and borrowings 
changes in net interest income result from changes in volume  net interest spread and net interest margin 
volume refers to the average dollar levels of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
net interest spread refers to the difference between the average yield on interest earning assets and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin refers to net interest income divided by average interest earning assets and is influenced by the level and relative mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the federal open markets committee fomc uses the fed funds rate  which is the interest rate used by banks to lend to each other  to influence interest rates and the economy 
changes in the fed funds rate has a direct correlation to changes in the prime rate  the underlying index for most of the variable rate loans issued by the company 
the prime rate was at at the beginning of  but was decreased to in june  the lowest rate since during  with the economy expanding  the fomc raised the fed funds rate five times in the last six months of that year 
this resulted in a corresponding increase in the prime rate 
the prime rate was at the end of and remained static until june   when it increased to 
during the third and fourth quarters of  four additional basis point increases raised the prime rate to 
during  eight basis point increases in the prime rate raised the rate at the end of to 
although the company has historically maintained an asset sensitive profile  meaning that assets generally reprice faster than our liabilities  we implemented an asset liability strategy in to use interest rate swaps to reduce our overall sensitivity 
the following table presents  for the periods indicated  certain information related to our average asset and liability structure and our average yields on assets and average costs of liabilities

loan fees included in interest income are not material 
nonaccrual loans are included in average loans outstanding 
net interest income on a tax equivalent basis was million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  from million at december  the increase was primarily due to an increase of million in interest earning assets and an basis point increase in the average yield on earning assets  partially offset by a basis point increase in the average yield on interest bearing liabilities 
the company also benefited by a decrease in average wholesale borrowings  which carry a higher cost of funds than deposits 
average wholesale borrowings ended at of average interest bearing liabilities compared to at the end of net interest income on a tax equivalent basis was million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  from million at december  although net interest income increased and interest rates began to increase in the latter part of  the company s net interest margin was still being impacted by lower yielding assets added to the balance sheet during and  a time when rates were significantly depressed 
the decrease in the yield on loans reflected the increase in repricing of existing loans at lower rates 
yields on our interest earning assets declined by basis points to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  yields paid on interest bearing liabilities dropped by basis points during this same period 
the overall result was a net interest margin of for the year ended december   down from for the year ended december  in order to reduce our asset sensitivity  the company implemented an asset liability strategy using interest rate swaps to fix the interest rate on a portion of our variable rate loans indexed to prime 
during and  the company entered into interest rate swaps with a total notional value of million that typically amortize over a four year period 
the company receives a fixed rate and pays a variable rate based on the notional amounts 
under the terms of these swaps  as of the end of  the company paid a weighted average rate of and received 
as of the end of  the company paid a weighted average rate of and received 
during and  the company recognized a basis point and a basis point increase in its net interest margin  respectively  due to the interest rate swaps 
provision and allowance for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses decreased by  to million for the year ended december   down from million for  and million in this decrease was due to continuing improvement in the overall credit quality associated with our loan portfolio and improved economic conditions 
key indicators of asset quality have remained favorable as net charge offs and non performing loans have decreased from to  while average outstanding loan amounts have increased to billion for  up from billion for  and million for at december   the allowance for loan losses amounted to million  or of total loans compared to of total loans in  and in noninterest income 
the following table presents noninterest income for the years ended december   and year ended december  in thousands noninterest income deposit service charges other loan fees trust and advisory income insurance revenue investment banking income other income gain on sale of other assets and securities total noninterest income trust and advisory income 
trust and advisory income for increased million  or  to million  compared to trust and advisory income for increased million  or  to million compared to acmg s revenues are dependent upon the market value of their assets under management 
as the equity markets have shown improvement  acmg s income has increased each quarter since we acquired them in although trust and advisory income was up for  the increase was relatively muted as the segment concentrated on building its infrastructure and back office depth 
discretionary assets under management for increased million  or  to million  compared to the increase in trust and advisory income for was primarily due to the fact that included a full months of operations for acmg  while only included nine months 
an increase in the market value of assets under management  due to both market increases and the number of clients represented by our investment management group  also contributed to the increase in discretionary assets under management increased to million at the end of  from million at the end of insurance income 
insurance income for increased million  or  to million  compared to insurance income for increased million  or  to million compared to insurance income is derived from three main areas  wealth transfer  benefits consulting and p c 
the majority of fees earned on wealth transfer transactions are earned at the inception of the product offering in the form of commissions 
as the fees on these products are transactional by nature  fee income can fluctuate from period to period based on the number of transactions that have been closed 
revenue from benefits consulting and p c are more recurring revenue sources 
the increase in insurance income for was primarily the result of growth in our benefits consulting group  and to a lesser extent the wealth transfer and p c groups 
income from the benefits consulting group increased million to million in  compared to million in income from the wealth transfer and p c groups both increased million to million and million  respectively 
the company has expanded the number of producers in all areas of its insurance operations during and expects the segment to show continued growth  particularly in the benefits consulting and property and casualty groups 
the increase in insurance income for was primarily due to an increase in contingent commissions  employee benefit consulting commissions  and p c commissions  offset by a decrease in life insurance commissions 
contingent commissions are commissions received from insurance carriers related to policy renewals and the loss performance of the underwritten policies 
the company earned million in contingent commissions during  compared to million in the company s benefits consulting division increased revenue in to million from million in in june  the company acquired a small employee benefit consulting book of business which contributed to this increase 
the company also realized a increase in revenues earned from its p c division which totaled million in compared to million in the year included a full months of operations for fdl  while only included nine months 
fdl s revenue during was million compared to million in as noted above  a significant portion of fdl s income is transactional in nature  generated by the sale of life insurance policies where a considerable amount is earned when the policy is signed and a smaller amount is earned in subsequent years as the policy is renewed 
during  million was earned from this revenue stream compared to million in investment banking income 
investment banking income for decreased million  or  to million  compared to investment banking income for increased million  or  to million compared to investment banking income includes retainer fees which are recognized over the expected term of the engagement and success fees which are recognized when the transaction is completed and collectibility of fees is reasonably assured 
investment banking income is transactional by nature and will fluctuate based on the number of clients engaged and transactions successfully closed 
the decrease in investment banking income during was due to a lower number of transactions closed during the year as compared to the income earned from investment banking during was higher than any other year since we acquired gmb in although we continue to feel optimistic about the outlook for the m a market and the gmb business model  we do not expect that gmb will replicate the operating results achieved in other income 
other income for increased million  or  to million  compared to other income for increased million  or  to million compared to other income is comprised of increases in the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance boli  earnings on equity method investments  merchant charges  bankcard fees  wire transfer fees  foreign exchange fees and safe deposit income 
the increase in other income for was primarily due to a million increase in the cash surrender value of boli 
the company purchased an additional million in boli during january the increase in other income for was primarily due to a million increase in the cash surrender value of boli and a million increase in foreign exchange fees 
the majority of our boli value at the end of was purchased in the latter part of and during  thus providing a larger average balance on which to earn income during the increase in foreign exchange fees was due to the enhancement of our international products during gain on sale of other assets and securities 
during  we rebalanced our investment portfolio by selling certain securities and purchasing other securities 
all of the securities sold were in a gain position  that did not impact the company s accounting for securities held in a loss position under current accounting guidance 
the increase in gains on sales of other assets and securities was primarily due to the sale of available for sale mortgage backed securities 
noninterest expense 
the following table presents noninterest expense for the years ended december   and year ended december  in thousands noninterest expenses salaries and employee benefits occupancy expenses  premises and equipment amortization of intangibles other operating expenses loss on sale of other assets and securities total noninterest expenses during our efficiency ratio improved to from in and in the efficiency ratio is a measure of the company s overhead  measuring the percentage of each dollar of income that is paid in operating expenses 
our efficiency ratio has declined as we have begun to recognize the benefit of fixed cost projects put in place to facilitate the company s growth 
noninterest expense for includes the operations of acmg and fdl for the full months while only includes the nine months subsequent to the acquisition dates 
salaries and employee benefits 
salaries and employee benefits increased million  or  to million compared to salaries and employee benefits increased million  or  to million compared to the increase in was primarily due to the growth of our full time equivalent employee base 
as of december   the company employed full time equivalent employees  compared to in the growth in full time equivalent employees is due to the addition of two new de novo banks  organic growth of existing operations and an investment in the future growth of our insurance operations by hiring additional producers 
also contributing to the increase was our annual cost of living and performance raises awarded to employees effective at the beginning of  which averaged 
the company also recognized a  or million increase in the cost of providing medical insurance  as medical costs for all industries have continued to rise rapidly 
the increase in normal wages was offset by a million decrease in bonus compensation  due to the decrease in revenue from investment banking 
the increase in was due to higher staffing levels to accommodate the growth of the franchise  annual merit increases  and increases in health insurance and other benefit costs 
there was also a substantial increase in the bonuses paid from our investment banking subsidiary to match the increase in their operating results 
in recognition of our operating results  the board of directors approved an additional bonus to all of our employees during that was not paid in the company also introduced a supplemental employee retirement plan for certain key executives during occupancy costs 
occupancy costs increased million  or  to million compared to occupancy costs increased million  or  to million compared to the increase in occupancy costs in was primarily the result of depreciation expense million  rent expense million  and utilities million 
occupancy costs have increased due to the additions of one colorado and three arizona bank locations subsequent to the fourth quarter of  as well as the addition of a new operations center 
beginning in the fourth quarter of  the company began centralizing its information technology and operational areas in a new leased location 
the move was finalized in the first quarter of to the new location that includes  square feet of office and data center space 
this move  as well as our new de novos  has increased rent  depreciation and maintenance expense 
the increase in was due to the aforementioned acquisitions of fdl and acmg  the additions of the northwest and camelback locations during  and the inclusion of the tempe and northeast bank locations for their first full year 
an ongoing commitment to providing the highest level of technological service to our customers also increased our depreciation and maintenance expense 
other operating expenses 
other operating expenses increased million  or  to million compared to in  other operating expenses increased million  or  to million compared to the increase in was primarily due to professional services million  marketing million  and operational losses million 
professional services increased primarily due to third party referral fees paid on investment banking transactions 
marketing has increased as the company increases its community donations as operating results improve  and as a result of our growth initiatives as we attempt to increase our loan and deposit bases and grow our fee based business lines 
the operational losses relate primarily to deposit fraud losses incurred by our bank franchise and a loss associated with the termination of an interest rate hedge 
the increase in was primarily in the areas of marketing  correspondent bank and federal reserve charges  occ assessments  and miscellaneous operational losses 
our correspondent bank and federal reserve charges increased as we grew and serviced high volume customers  which increased our correspondent and federal reserve activity 
professional services increased as we implemented and explored new it initiatives  and an increase in external accountant and consulting fees  which was partly due to the implementation of the provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of our operational losses are generally lower than industry average  but in we recognized a loss related to a bank robbery for which we recognized a loss equal million 
federal income taxes 
the provision for income taxes totaled million during  compared to million in  and million in the effective tax rates for  and were  and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources our liquidity management objective is to ensure our ability to satisfy the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers  and to allow us to sustain our operations 
historically  our primary source of funds has been customer deposits 
scheduled loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds  while deposit inflows and unscheduled loan prepayments which are influenced by fluctuations in the general level of interest rates  returns available on other investments  competition  economic conditions  and other factors are less predictable 
in addition  the company has commitments to extend credit under lines of credit and stand by letters of credit 
the company has also committed to investing in certain partnerships 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on these commitments 
borrowings may be used on a short term basis to compensate for reductions in other sources of funds such as deposit inflows at less than projected levels 
borrowings may also be used on a longer term basis to support expanded lending activities and to match the maturity or repricing intervals of assets 
the company is required under federal banking regulations to maintain sufficient reserves to fund deposit withdrawals  loan commitments and expenses 
we monitor our cash position on a daily basis in order to meet these requirements 
we use various forms of short term borrowings for cash management and liquidity purposes on a limited basis 
these forms of borrowings include federal funds purchased  securities sold under agreements to repurchase  the state of colorado treasury s time deposit program and borrowings from the fhlb 
the bank has approved federal funds purchase lines with seven other banks with an aggregate credit line of million as well as credit lines of million with three firms to transact repurchase agreements 
in addition  the bank may apply for up to million of state of colorado time deposits 
the bank also has a line of credit from the fhlb that is limited by the amount of eligible collateral available to secure the borrowings 
borrowings under the fhlb line are required to be secured by unpledged securities and qualifying loans 
at december   we had million in unpledged securities and qualifying loans available to collateralize fhlb borrowings and securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
during the second quarter of  we began participating in the us treasury s term investment option tio program for treasury tax and loan participants 
the tio program allows us to obtain additional short term funds at a rate determined through an auction process that is limited by the amount of eligible collateral available to secure it 
at the holding company level  our primary source of funds are dividends paid from the bank and our fee based business lines  management fees assessed to the bank and the fee based business lines  proceeds from the issuance of common stock  and other capital markets activity 
the main use of this liquidity is the quarterly payment of dividends on our common stock  quarterly interest payments on the junior subordinated debentures  payments for merger and acquisition activity including potential earn out payments  and payments for the salaries and benefits for the employees of the holding company 
the approval of the office of the comptroller of the currency is required prior to the declaration of any dividend by the bank if the total of all dividends declared by the bank in any calendar year exceeds the total of its net profits for that year combined with the retained net profits for the preceding two years 
in addition  the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of provides that the bank cannot pay a dividend if it will cause the bank to be undercapitalized 
the company s ability to pay dividends on its common stock depends upon the availability of dividends from the bank and earnings from its fee based businesses  as well as the company s compliance with the capital adequacy guidelines of the frb 
see item business supervision and regulation and note to our consolidated financial statements for an analysis of the compliance of the bank and cobiz with applicable capital adequacy guidelines 
maintaining adequate capital levels is integral to providing stability to the company  resources to achieve the company s growth objectives  and returns to the shareholders in the form of dividends 
in addition  as described above in business supervision and regulation  federal regulations establish minimum requirements for the capital adequacy of the company and the bank 
we continually monitor existing and alternative financing sources to support our capital and liquidity needs  including but not limited to  debt issuance  common stock issuance and deposit funding sources 
based on our current financial condition and our results of operations  we believe that the company will be able to raise adequate capital through one of these financing sources  as needed 
the company has issued a total of million of trust preferred securities through statutory trusts that are not included in the company s consolidated financial statements 
although the accounts of the trusts are not included in the company s consolidated financial statements  million of the million in trust preferred securities issued by the trusts are included in tier capital for regulatory capital purposes as allowed by the federal reserve board 
on february   the federal reserve board finalized a rule that would continue to allow the inclusion of trust preferred securities issued by unconsolidated subsidiary trusts in tier capital  but with stricter quantitative and qualitative standards 
under the rule  after a transition period ending on march   the aggregate amount of trust preferred securities and certain other capital elements would be limited to of tier capital elements  net of goodwill that has been reduced by any associated deferred tax liability 
the amount of trust preferred securities and certain other elements in excess of the limit could be included in tier capital  subject to restrictions 
based on the final rule  the company s allowable trust preferred securities in tier capital would decrease to million if it had been in effect at december  the additional amount excluded from tier capital would be included in tier capital and the company would still be well capitalized under prompt corrective action provisions 
on november   the company filed a universal shelf registration that allows the company to issue any combination of debt securities  preferred stock  depositary shares  common stock and securities warrants from time to time in one or more offerings up to a total dollar amount of million 
while the company has no present intention to issue securities under the registration statement  the company will be able to issue these securities in response to market conditions and the company s capital needs 
comparison for the years ended december  and net cash provided by operating activities totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
net cash provided by operating activities is comprised of the company s net income  adjusted for non cash charges and changes in operating assets and liabilities 
our cash uses for operations continue to grow as we deploy our de novo strategy and grow our fee based business lines 
net cash used in investing activities totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in cash used in investing activities is primarily related to a decrease in net additi ons to the investment portfolio  primarily mortgage backed securities million that the company uses to manage liquidity and interest rate risk as the company deleverages our investment portfolio  and a decrease in cash paid for acquisitions due to the earn out payments related to acmg and fdl million 
these decreases were offset by increases in the net loan originations and repayments million due to the growth of the company  and an increase in cash paid for bank owned life insurance during as compared to million 
as the company receives proceeds from the maturity and paydown of existing securities  the company intends to reinvest the proceeds into new securities in order to maintain an investment portfolio of approximately to of our total assets 
however  depending on the growth of our loan portfolio and our collateral position  proceeds may also be used to reduce our wholesale borrowings 
net cash provided by financing activities totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in net cash provided by financing activities is primarily attributed to the decrease in the issuance of junior subordinated debentures million in as compared to and  a decrease in cash inflows from total deposits million  and a decrease in cash flows in wholesale borrowings million including fed funds purchased  repurchase agreements and advances from the federal home loan bank during the year ended as compared to the company reduced the level of investment securities during  allowing us to reduce the level of wholesale borrowing fed funds purchased  fhlb advances and street repurchase agreements during comparison for the years ended december  and net cash provided by operating activities totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase was primarily due to an increase in cash received from net interest income of million and an increase in cash received from non interest income of million  offset by higher operating expenses 
during  our average interest earning assets increased by million  while our interest bearing liabilities only increased by million 
the net increase in our interest earning assets helped drive our cash receipts from net interest income 
our cash receipts from our fee based business lines increased substantially  primarily due to the m a transactions closed by gmb 
net cash used in investing activities totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily related to an increase in net loan originations and repayments million due to the growth of the company  net additions to the investment portfolio  primarily mortgage backed securities million that the company uses to manage liquidity and interest rate risk  and an increase in cash paid for acquisitions due to the earn out payments related to acmg and fdl million

we will often structure the purchase price of an acquired entity to include an earn out  which is a contingent payment based on achieving future performance levels 
given the uncertainty of today s economic climate and the performance challenges it creates for companies  we feel the use of earn outs in acquisitions is an effective method to bridge the expectation gap between a buyer s caution and a seller s optimism 
earn outs help to protect buyers from paying a full valuation up front without the assurance of the acquisition s performance  while allowing sellers to participate in the full value of the company provided the anticipated performance does occur 
since the earn out payments are determined based on the acquired company s performance during the earn out period  the total payments to be made are not known at the time of the acquisition 
the company has committed to make additional earn out payments to the former owners of acmg and fdl based on earnings performance 
there were no earn out payments owed as of december  the contractual amount of the company s financial instruments with off balance sheet risk  expiring by period at december   is presented below in thousands within one year after one but within three years after three but within five years after five years total unfunded loan commitments standby letters of credit commercial letters of credit unfunded commitments for unconsolidated investments company guarantees total commitments the company is party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the liquidity  credit enhancement  and financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments include legally binding commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit and involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized on the balance sheet 
credit risk is the principal risk associated with these instruments 
the contractual amounts of these instruments represent the amount of credit risk should the instruments be fully drawn upon and the customer defaults 
to control the credit risk associated with entering into commitments and issuing letters of credit  the company uses the same credit quality  collateral policies and monitoring controls in making commitments and letters of credit as it does with its lending activities 
the company evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral obtained  if deemed necessary by the company upon extension of credit  is based on management s credit evaluation 
legally binding commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
since many of the commitments may expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
standby letters of credit obligate the company to meet certain financial obligations of its customers if  under the contractual terms of the agreement  the customers are unable to do so 
the financial standby letters of credit issued by the company are irrevocable 
payment is only guaranteed under these letters of credit upon the borrower s failure to perform its obligations to the beneficiary 
approximately million of total commitments at december   represent commitments to extend credit at fixed rates of interest  which exposes the company to some degree of interest rate risk 
the company has also entered into interest rate swap agreements under which it is required to either receive or pay cash to a counterparty depending on changes in interest rates 
the interest rate swaps are carried at their fair value on the consolidated balance sheet with the fair value representing the net present value of expected future cash receipts or payments based on market interest rates as of the balance sheet date 
because the interest rate swaps recorded on the balance sheet at december   do not represent amounts that will ultimately be received or paid under the contract  they are excluded from the table above 
effects of inflation and changing prices the primary impact of inflation on our operations is increased operating costs 
unlike most retail or manufacturing companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution such as the company are monetary in nature 
as a result  the impact of interest rates on a financial institution s performance is generally greater than the impact of inflation 
although interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction  or to the same extent  as the prices of goods and services  increases in inflation generally have resulted in increased interest rates 
over short periods of time  interest rates may not move in the same direction  or at the same magnitude  as inflation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk asset liability management asset liability management is concerned with the timing and magnitude of repricing assets compared to liabilities 
it is our objective to generate stable growth in net interest income and to attempt to control risks associated with interest rate movements 
in general  our strategy is to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income by maintaining a favorable match between the maturities or repricing dates of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
we adjust interest sensitivity during the year through changes in the mix of assets and liabilities 
our asset and liability management strategy is formulated and monitored by the asset liability management committee  in accordance with policies approved by the board of directors of the bank 
this committee meets regularly to review  among other things  the sensitivity of our assets and liabilities to interest rate changes  the book and market values of assets and liabilities  unrealized gains and losses  purchase and sale activity  and maturities of investments and borrowings 
the asset liability committee also approves and establishes pricing and funding decisions with respect to our overall asset and liability composition 
the committee reviews our liquidity  cash flow flexibility  maturities of investments  deposits and borrowings  deposit activity  current market conditions  and general levels of interest rates 
to effectively measure and manage interest rate risk  we use simulation analysis to determine the impact on net interest income of changes in interest rates under various interest rate scenarios 
from these simulations  interest rate risk is quantified and appropriate strategies are developed and implemented 
the following table presents an analysis of the interest rate sensitivity inherent in our net interest income and market value of equity 
the interest rate scenario presented in the table includes interest rates at december   as adjusted by instantaneous rate changes upward and downward of up to basis points 
since there are limitations inherent in any methodology used to estimate the exposure to changes in market interest rates  this analysis is not intended to be a forecast of the actual effect of a change in market interest rates 
the market value sensitivity analysis presented includes assumptions that i the composition of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities existing at december   will remain constant over the month measurement period  and ii that changes in market rates are parallel and instantaneous across the yield curve regardless of duration or repricing characteristics of specific assets or liabilities 
further  the analysis does not contemplate any actions that we might undertake in response to changes in market interest rates 
accordingly  this analysis is not intended to and does not provide a precise forecast of the effect actual changes in market rates will have on us 
change in interest rates in basis points impact on net interest income market value of equity our results of operations depend significantly on net interest income 
like most financial institutions  our interest income and cost of funds are affected by general economic conditions and by competition in the marketplace 
rising and falling interest rate environments can have various impacts on net interest income  depending on the interest rate profile ie  the difference between the repricing of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the relative changes in interest rates that occur when various assets and liabilities reprice  unscheduled repayments of loans and investments  early withdrawals of deposits  and other factors 
as a general rule  banks with positive interest rate gaps are more likely to be susceptible to declines in net interest income in periods of falling interest rates  while banks with negative interest rate gaps are more likely to experience declines in net interest income in periods of rising interest rates 
at december   our cumulative interest rate gap was a positive 
therefore  assuming no change in our gap position  a rise in interest rates is likely to result in increased net interest income  while a decline in interest rates is likely to result in decreased net interest income 
this is a point in time position that is continually changing and is not indicative of our position at any other time 
while the gap position is a useful tool in measuring interest rate risk and contributes toward effective asset and liability management  shortcomings are inherent in gap analysis since certain assets and liabilities may not move proportionally as interest rates change 
consequently  in addition to gap analysis  we use the simulation model discussed above to test the interest rate sensitivity of net interest income and the balance sheet 
the following table sets forth the estimated maturity or repricing  and the resulting interest rate gap  of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  all amounts in the table are based on contractual repricing schedules 
actual prepayment and withdrawal experience may vary significantly from the assumptions reflected in the table 
for information on the fair value of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities see note to our consolidated financial statements 
estimated maturity or repricing at december  in thousands less than three months three months to less than one year one to five years over five years total interest earning assets fixed rate loans floating rate loans investment securities held to maturity and available for sale total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities now and money market accounts savings time deposits under  time deposits  and over securities and loans sold under agreements to repurchase other short term borrowings junior subordinated debentures total interest bearing liabilities interest rate gap cumulative interest rate gap cumulative interest rate gap to total assets to manage the relationship of our interest earning assets and liabilities  we evaluate the following factors liquidity  equity  debt capital ratio  anticipated prepayment rates  portfolio maturities  maturing assets and maturing liabilities 
our asset and liability management committee is responsible for establishing procedures that enable us to achieve our goals while adhering to prudent banking practices and existing loan and investment policies 
we have focused on maintaining balance between interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities and repricing frequencies 
an important element of this focus has been to emphasize variable rate loans and investments funded by deposits that also mature or reprice over periods of months or less 
the following table presents  at december   loans by maturity in each major category of our portfolio 
actual maturities may differ from the contractual maturities shown below as a result of renewals and prepayments 
loan renewals are evaluated in the same manner as new credit applications 
at december  in thousands less than one year one to five years over five years total commercial real estate mortgage real estate construction consumer total loans and leases of the million of loans with maturities of one year or more  approximately million were fixed rate loans and million were variable rate loans at december  to augment our asset and liability management strategy  we also began using interest rate swaps in  with the overall goal of minimizing the impact of interest rate fluctuations on our net interest margin 
interest rate swaps involve the exchange of fixed rate and variable rate interest payment obligations without the exchange of the underlying notional amounts 
since we implemented the program in  we have entered into different interest rate swap agreements as summarized in the table below 
under the interest rate swap agreements  we receive a fixed rate and pay a variable rate based on the prime rate 
the swaps qualify as cash flow hedges under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  and are designated as hedges of the variability of cash flows we receive from certain of our prime indexed loans 
in accordance with sfas no 
 these swap agreements are measured at fair value and reported as assets or liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition 
the portion of the change in the fair value of the swaps that is deemed effective in hedging the cash flows of the designated assets are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of tax effects oci and reclassified into interest income when such cash flows occur in the future 
any ineffectiveness resulting from the hedges is recorded as a gain or loss in the consolidated statements of income as a part of non interest income 
interest rate swap information at december  is summarized as follows amortization of notional swap maturity date fixed rate notional fair market value swap may  june  swap july  july  swap july  august  swap august  september  swap october  october  swap october  november  swap november  december  swap january  december  swap april  january  swap may  february  swap july  march  total during and  net interest income was increased by  and  respectively  from the settlement of amounts receivable on interest rate swaps
