item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations acquisitions and investments 
financial information and segments we operate in three primary business segments 
we are in the crude oil and natural gas exploration and production business and  through our interests in pvr  we are in the coal and natural gas midstream businesses 
for financial statement purposes  the assets  liabilities and earnings of pvr are included in our consolidated financial statements  with the public unitholders ownership interest reflected as a minority interest 
in  approximately percent of our operating income was attributable to our oil and gas segment  percent was attributable to our coal segment and percent was attributable to our natural gas midstream segment  less a seven percent operating loss related to corporate and other functions 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for financial information concerning our business segments 
oil and gas segment overview general in our oil and gas segment  our goal is to use our knowledge and experience to build a portfolio of assets with sustainability and growth potential  even at much lower commodity prices than we experienced in we focus on relatively low risk  unconventional natural gas oriented resource plays  such as our horizontal coal bed methane hcbm project in appalachia  our cotton valley play in east texas and north louisiana and our selma chalk project in mississippi 
we are also assessing the potential of organic shale plays in the appalachian and illinois basins and new unconventional plays in the williston basin 
we also generate and drill exploratory prospects which could make a meaningful difference to our production and reserve profile  primarily in south texas and south louisiana 
our increased oil and gas segment operating income and cash flows in were the direct result of both our record oil and natural gas production levels and price realizations 
highlights of our oil and gas segment s performance in are as follows oil and gas production in was bcfe  a company record 
this production increase  which surpassed the previous record of bcfe in by percent  was primarily due to the continued success of our development projects in appalachia  east texas and mississippi 
our estimated proved reserves at the end of were a company record bcfe  up six percent from bcfe at the end of  and up percent after considering our sale of bcfe in the first quarter of natural gas comprised approximately percent of year end proved reserves  and percent of total year end reserves were attributable to proved developed wells 
net of revisions  we added approximately bcfe of proved reserves primarily from extensions  discoveries and additions  replacing percent of production 
we drilled wells during  including development wells and exploratory wells 
all but three of the development wells were successful 
six of the exploratory wells were successful  three were dry holes  and three are under evaluation 
in  we drilled development wells in our hcbm project in west virginia 
all were successful 
net production from our hcbm wells increased percent  from bcfe in to approximately bcfe in we also added approximately  acres to our cbm prospective leasehold position in the appalachian basin and modified our agreement with cdx gas  llc cdx to obligate cdx to commit three horizontal drilling rigs and associated crews to drill full time within our area of mutual interest with cdx  which covers most of central appalachia 
we drilled development wells in our cotton valley project in east texas and north louisiana 
again  all were successful 
most of these wells were in the north carthage field  which is part of our bethany development drilling joint venture with gmx resources inc nasdaq gmxr 
as a direct result of our successful and growing development drilling program in the play  net production in the cotton valley project area increased to bcfe in from bcfe in we drilled successful development wells in our selma chalk project in mississippi during production in our mississippi fields in was bcfe  compared to bcfe in this increase was primarily a result of new production in the baxterville and maxie fields  offset in part by normal field declines and disruptions due to hurricane katrina 
in south texas and south louisiana  we drilled five exploratory wells with three successes and four development wells  three of which were successful  including a successful lower frio exploratory well and follow on development well drilled in our estill prospect in the rugeley field in matagorda county  texas 
the prospect was generated by us  with a percent working interest  and is operated by brigham exploration company nasdaq bexp 
another successful exploratory well was drilled in the hackberry formation on our fannett prospect in jefferson county  texas  in which we have a percent working interest 
during  we also began evaluating several new potential development plays 
in the williston basin  we drilled an exploratory well as part of our agreement with bill barrett corporation nyse bbg for a percent working interest in a  net acre bakken dolomite horizontal oil well prospect 
we also drilled two percent working interest exploratory wells in the new albany shale in the illinois basin during the fourth quarter 
reservoir analysis is currently in progress  with completion and testing expected over the remainder of transportation the majority of our natural gas production is transported to market on four major pipeline or transmission systems 
nisource inc  crosstex energy services lp  gulf south pipeline company  lp  and dominion transmission  inc  transported percent  percent  percent and percent of our natural gas production 
the remainder of our natural gas production was transported by several pipeline companies in texas  louisiana and west virginia 
in almost all cases  our natural gas is sold at interconnects with transmission pipelines 
we have entered into contracts which provide firm transportation capacity rights for specified volumes per day on a pipeline system for terms ranging from one to years 
the contracts require us to pay transportation demand charges regardless of the amount of pipeline capacity we use 
we may sell excess capacity to third parties at our discretion 
marketing and hedging we generally sell our natural gas using spot market and short term fixed price physical contracts 
for the year ended december   two customers of the oil and gas segment  dominion field services and crosstex gulfcoast marketing  accounted for approximately percent and percent of our natural gas and oil and condensate revenues of million 
from time to time  we enter into commodity derivative contracts or fixed price physical contracts to mitigate the risk associated with the volatility of natural gas and crude oil prices 
recently  we have utilized swaps and costless collars in connection with our hedging activities 
gains and losses from hedging activities are included in revenues when the hedged production is sold 
we recognized losses on settled hedging activities of million  million and million in  and in  we hedged approximately percent of our natural gas production using costless collars at an average floor price of per mmbtu and an average ceiling price of per mmbtu 
we also hedged approximately percent of our crude oil production using a fixed price swap in january and a costless collar beginning in march and continuing for the remainder of the year 
the swap price was per barrel  and the costless collar had a floor price of per barrel and a ceiling price of per barrel 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for information about our price risk management positions for future periods 
coal segment overview in our coal segment  pvr owned or controlled approximately million tons of coal as of december  pvr enters into long term leases with experienced  third party mine operators providing them the right to mine pvr s coal reserves in exchange for royalty payments 
pvr does not operate any mines 
in  pvr s lessees produced million tons of coal from its properties and paid pvr coal royalty revenues of million  for an average gross coal royalty per ton of 
approximately percent of coal royalty revenues in and percent of coal royalty revenues in were derived from coal mined on pvr s properties under leases containing royalty rates based on the higher of a fixed base price or a percentage of the gross sales price 
the balance of coal royalty revenues for the respective periods was derived from coal mined on pvr s properties under leases containing fixed royalty rates which escalate annually 
substantially all of pvr s leases require the lessee to pay minimum rental payments in monthly or annual installments 
pvr actively works with its lessees to develop efficient methods to exploit coal reserves and to maximize production from pvr s properties 
pvr earns revenues from providing fee based coal preparation and transportation services to pvr s lessees  which enhance their production levels and generate additional coal royalty revenues  and from industrial third party coal end users by owning and operating coal handling facilities through pvr s joint venture with massey energy company massey 
pvr also earns revenues from oil and gas royalty interests  coal transportation wheelage rights and the sale of standing timber on pvr s properties 
pvr s management continues to focus on acquisitions which increase and diversify pvr s sources of cash flow 
pvr completed four coal reserve acquisitions in  spending approximately million to add approximately million tons of coal reserves  including million tons of coal reserves in the illinois basin  a new area for pvr 
pvr s acquisitions also included oil and natural gas well royalty interests and wheelage rights 
for a more detailed discussion of pvr s acquisitions  see item  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations acquisitions and investments 
natural gas midstream segment overview on march   pvr completed the acquisition of cantera gas resources  llc cantera  a midstream gas gathering and processing company with primary locations in the mid continent area of oklahoma and the panhandle of texas the cantera acquisition 
as a result of the cantera acquisition  pvr owns and operates a significant set of midstream assets that include approximately  miles of gas gathering pipelines and three natural gas processing facilities  which have million cubic feet per day mmcfd of total capacity 
pvr s midstream business derives revenues primarily from gas processing contracts with natural gas producers and from fees charged for gathering natural gas volumes and providing other related services 
the cantera acquisition also included a natural gas marketing business  which aggregates third party volumes and sells those volumes into intrastate pipeline systems and at market hubs accessed by various interstate pipelines 
pvr believes that the cantera acquisition established a platform for future growth in the natural gas midstream sector and diversified its cash flows into another long lived asset base 
since acquiring this business  pvr has focused on integrating the accounting and commercial systems necessary to prudently operating a natural gas midstream business  and has expanded its natural gas midstream business by adding miles of new gathering lines which connect new wells to pvr s gathering and processing systems 
for the ten months ended december   pvr s midstream operations generated a gross processing margin of million  consisting of midstream revenues minus the cost of gas purchased 
inlet volumes at pvr s gas processing plants and gathering systems were bcf  or approximately mmcfd  for the same ten month period  with a gross processing margin of per thousand cubic feet mcf 
two of pvr s natural gas midstream customers  bp canada energy marketing corp 
and conocophillips company  accounted for percent and percent of our consolidated revenues in pvr continually seeks new supplies of natural gas to both offset the natural declines in production from the wells currently connected to its systems and to increase throughput volume 
new natural gas supplies are obtained for all of pvr s systems by contracting for production from new wells  connecting new wells drilled on dedicated acreage and by contracting for natural gas that has been released from competitors systems 
business strategy our principal business strategies for the oil and gas segment  the coal segment  the natural gas midstream segment and the company in general are oil and gas segment focus on relatively low risk  unconventional natural gas oriented resource plays  such as the hcbm play in appalachia  the cotton valley play in east texas and north louisiana and the selma chalk in mississippi 
in addition to our established core areas  we are assessing the potential to establish new sustainable growth in organic shale and other unconventional plays in new areas  such as the williston and illinois basins 
we work with established industry partners in several of these core and potential new areas 
generate and drill exploratory prospects  primarily in south texas and south louisiana  which could result in an increase in our proved reserves and production 
these prospects tend to have relatively higher risk profiles and higher returns when successful  and we work with industry partners to better manage costs and risks 
coal segment pvr coal continue to acquire coal reserves  including in pvr s appalachian core area and new areas 
for example  pvr s acquisition of million tons of illinois basin coal reserves was made because pvr views the illinois basin as a growth area  both because of its proximity to power plants and because it expects future environmental regulations will require scrubbing of most coals  including lower sulfur coals from other basins 
expand pvr s coal services and infrastructure business on pvr s properties and pvr s joint venture with massey  which provides coal handling facilities and services to industrial end users 
natural gas midstream segment pvr midstream expand pvr midstream  both organically  by adding new natural gas production to pvr s existing gathering and processing systems  and through acquisitions of new stand alone midstream assets or those which can be assimilated into pvr s existing systems 
explore ways for pvr to provide services to our oil and gas exploration and production business 
company maintain financial discipline and flexibility 
the company and pvr operate with separate  independent capital structures 
we intend to continue to be fiscally conservative in both entities and to manage our capital structure for the long term  which means that we will continue to be cautious regarding debt levels and dividend or distribution increases 
partnership distributions cash distributions the partnership paid cash distributions of per common and subordinated unit during the year ended december  in the first quarter of  the partnership paid a quarterly distribution of annualized per unit with respect to the fourth quarter of for the remainder of  the partnership expects to pay quarterly distributions of annualized or more per common and subordinated unit 
we are entitled  through our wholly owned subsidiaries  to receive certain cash distributions payable with respect to the subordinated and common units of pvr held by such subsidiaries  as well as certain cash distributions payable with respect to the two percent general partner interest and the incentive distribution rights held by our general partner subsidiary 
we received total distributions from pvr of million and million in and  as shown in the following table in thousands limited partner units general partner interest incentive distribution rights total incentive distribution rights our wholly owned subsidiary is the general partner of pvr and  as such  holds certain incentive distribution rights which represent the right to receive an increasing percentage of quarterly distributions of available cash from operating surplus after the partnership has paid minimum quarterly distributions and certain target distribution levels have been achieved 
the minimum quarterly distribution is per unit annualized 
our general partner subsidiary currently holds percent of the incentive distribution rights  but may transfer these rights separately from its general partner interest to an affiliate other than an individual or to another entity as part of the merger or consolidation of the general partner with or into such entity or the transfer of all or substantially all of the general partner s assets to another entity without the prior approval of pvr s unitholders if the transferee agrees to be bound by the provisions of pvr s partnership agreement 
prior to september   other transfers of incentive distribution rights will require the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of pvr s outstanding common units and subordinated units  voting as separate classes 
on or after september   the incentive distribution rights will be freely transferable 
the incentive distributions rights are payable as follows if for any quarter pvr has distributed available cash from operating surplus to its common and subordinated unitholders in an amount equal to the minimum quarterly distribution  and pvr has distributed available cash from operating surplus on outstanding common units in an amount necessary to eliminate any cumulative arrearages in payment of the minimum quarterly distribution  then  pvr will distribute any additional available cash from operating surplus for that quarter among the unitholders and our general partner subsidiary in the following manner first  percent to all unitholders  and two percent to the general partner  until each unitholder has received a total of per unit for that quarter  second  percent to all unitholders  and percent to the general partner  until each unitholder has received a total of per unit for that quarter  third  percent to all unitholders  and percent to the general partner  until each unitholder has received a total of per unit for that quarter  and thereafter  percent to all unitholders and percent to the general partner 
subordination period during the subordination period  which we describe below  pvr s common units have the right to receive distributions of available cash from operating surplus in an amount equal to the minimum quarterly distribution  plus arrearages in the payment of any minimum quarterly distribution from prior quarters  before any distributions of available cash from operating surplus can be made on the subordinated units 
our wholly owned subsidiaries currently own an aggregate  subordinated units 
these subordinated units will convert to common units after the events described below have occurred 
the subordination period began on october   and will continue until the first day of the first quarter beginning after september   on which each of the following events has occurred distributions of available cash from operating surplus on each of the common units and the subordinated units equaled or exceeded the minimum quarterly distribution for each of the three consecutive  non overlapping four quarter periods immediately preceding that date  the adjusted operating surplus generated during each of the three immediately preceding  non overlapping four quarter periods equaled or exceeded the sum of the minimum quarterly distributions on all of the outstanding common units and subordinated units during those periods on a fully diluted basis and the related distribution on the two percent general partner interest during those periods  and there are no arrearages in payment of the minimum quarterly distribution on the common units 
competition oil and gas the oil and natural gas industry is very competitive  and we compete with a substantial number of other companies that are large  well established and have greater financial and operational resources than we do  which may adversely affect our ability to compete or grow our business 
many such companies not only engage in the acquisition  exploration  development and production of oil and natural gas reserves  but also carry on refining operations  electricity generation and the marketing of refined products 
competition is particularly intense in the acquisition of prospective oil and natural gas properties and oil and gas reserves 
our competitive position depends on our geological  geophysical and engineering expertise  our financial resources  our ability to develop properties and our ability to select  acquire and develop proved reserves 
we compete with other oil and natural gas companies in attempting to secure drilling rigs and other equipment necessary for drilling and completion of wells and recruiting and retaining qualified personnel  including geologists  geo physicists  engineers and other specialists 
such equipment and labor may be in short supply from time to time 
shortages of equipment  labor or materials may result in increased costs or the inability to obtain such resources as needed 
we also compete with major and independent oil and gas companies in the marketing and sale of oil and natural gas  and the oil and natural gas industry in general competes with other industries supplying energy and fuel to industrial  commercial and individual consumers 
coal the coal industry is intensely competitive primarily as a result of the existence of numerous producers 
pvr s lessees compete with coal producers in various regions of the united states for domestic sales 
the industry has undergone significant consolidation which has led to some of the competitors of pvr s lessees having significantly larger financial and operating resources than most of pvr s lessees 
pvr s lessees primarily compete with both large and small producers in appalachia as well as in the western united states 
pvr s lessees compete on the basis of coal price at the mine  coal quality including sulfur content  transportation cost from the mine to the customer and the reliability of supply 
continued demand for pvr s coal and the prices that pvr s lessees obtain are also affected by demand for electricity  demand for metallurgical coal  access to transportation  environmental and government regulations  technological developments and the availability and price of alternative fuel supplies  including nuclear  natural gas  oil and hydroelectric power 
demand for pvr s low sulfur coal and the prices pvr s lessees will be able to obtain for it will also be affected by the price and availability of high sulfur coal  which can be marketed in tandem with emissions allowances which permit the high sulfur coal to meet federal clean air act requirements 
natural gas midstream the ability to offer natural gas producers competitive gathering and processing arrangements and subsequent reliable service is fundamental to obtaining and keeping gas supplies for pvr s gathering systems 
the primary concerns of the producer are the pressure maintained on the system at the point of receipt  the relative volumes of gas consumed as fuel and lost  the gathering processing fees charged  the timeliness of well connects  the customer service orientation of the gatherer processor  and the reliability of the field services provided 
pvr experiences competition in all of its midstream markets 
pvr s competitors include major integrated oil companies  interstate and intrastate pipelines and companies that gather  compress  process  transport and market natural gas 
many of pvr s competitors have greater financial resources and access to larger natural gas supplies than pvr does 
regulation oil and gas state regulatory matters 
various aspects of our oil and natural gas operations are regulated by administrative agencies under statutory provisions of the states where such operations are conducted 
all of the jurisdictions in which we own or operate producing crude oil and natural gas properties have statutory provisions regulating the exploration for and production of crude oil and natural gas 
these provisions include permitting regulations regarding the drilling of wells  maintaining bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells  locating wells  the method of drilling and casing wells  the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled and the plugging and abandoning of wells 
our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations 
these include the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units  the number of wells that may be drilled in an area and the unitization or pooling of crude oil and natural gas properties 
in addition  state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from crude oil and natural gas wells  generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose certain requirements regarding the ratability or fair apportionment of production from fields and individual wells 
the effect of these regulations is to limit the amounts of crude oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill 
federal energy regulatory commission 
the federal energy regulatory commission the ferc regulates the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce under the natural gas act of the nga and the natural gas policy act of the ngpa 
in the past  the federal government has regulated the prices at which oil and gas could be sold 
the natural gas wellhead decontrol act of the decontrol act removed all nga and ngpa price and nonprice controls affecting producers wellhead sales of natural gas effective january  while sales by producers of their own natural gas production and all sales of crude oil  condensate and natural gas liquids can currently be made at market prices  congress could reenact price controls in the future 
commencing in april  the ferc issued order nos 
 a  b and c order no 
 which require interstate pipelines to provide transportation separate  or unbundled  from the pipelines sale of gas 
also  order no 
requires pipelines to provide open access transportation on a basis that is equal for all gas supplies 
although order no 
does not directly regulate gas producers like us  the ferc has stated that it intends for order no 
to foster increased competition within all phases of the natural gas industry 
the courts have largely affirmed the significant features of order no 
and numerous related orders pertaining to the individual pipelines  although certain appeals remain pending and the ferc continues to review and modify its open access regulations 
in particular  the ferc has issued order nos 
 a and b which  among other things  i permit pipelines to charge different maximum cost based rates for peak and off peak periods  ii encourage auctions for pipeline capacity  iii require pipelines to implement imbalance management services and iv restrict the ability of pipelines to impose penalties for imbalances  overruns and non compliance with operational flow orders 
in addition  the ferc has regulations in place that govern the procedure for obtaining authorization to construct new pipeline facilities and has issued a policy statement establishing a presumption in favor of requiring owners of newly constructed pipeline facilities to charge rates based on the incremental costs associated with such new pipeline facilities 
while any additional ferc action on these matters would affect us only indirectly  these changes are intended to further enhance competition in natural gas markets 
we cannot predict what further action the ferc will take on these matters  nor can we predict whether the ferc s actions will achieve its stated goal of increasing competition in natural gas markets 
however  we do not believe that we will be treated materially differently than other natural gas producers with which we compete 
environmental matters 
extensive federal  state and local laws govern oil and natural gas operations  regulate the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relate to the protection of the environment 
numerous governmental departments issue rules and regulations to implement and enforce such laws that are often difficult and costly to comply with and which carry substantial administrative  civil and even criminal penalties for failure to comply 
some laws  rules and regulations relating to protection of the environment may  in certain circumstances  impose strict liability for environmental contamination  rendering a person liable for environmental and natural resource damages and cleanup costs without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such person 
other laws  rules and regulations may restrict the rate of oil and natural gas production below the rate that would otherwise exist or even prohibit exploration or production activities in sensitive areas 
in addition  state laws often require some form of remedial action to prevent pollution from former operations  such as closure of inactive pits and plugging of abandoned wells 
the regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases its cost of doing business and consequently affects its profitability 
these laws  rules and regulations affect our operations  as well as the oil and gas exploration and production industry in general 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with current applicable environmental laws  rules and regulations and that continued compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse impact on us 
nevertheless  changes in existing environmental laws or the adoption of new environmental laws have the potential to adversely affect our operations 
osha 
we are subject to the requirements of the occupational safety and health act osha and comparable state laws that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers 
in addition  the osha hazard communication standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees  state and local government authorities and citizens coal general regulation applicable to coal lessees 
pvr s lessees are obligated to conduct mining operations in compliance with all applicable federal  state and local laws and regulations 
these laws and regulations include matters involving the discharge of materials into the environment  employee health and safety  mine permits and other licensing requirements  reclamation and restoration of mining properties after mining is completed  management of materials generated by mining operations  surface subsidence from underground mining  water pollution  legislatively mandated benefits for current and retired coal miners  air quality standards  protection of wetlands  plant and wildlife protection  limitations on land use  storage of petroleum products and substances which are regarded as hazardous under applicable laws and management of electrical equipment containing polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs 
because of extensive and comprehensive regulatory requirements  violations during mining operations are not unusual in the industry and  notwithstanding compliance efforts  we do not believe violations by pvr s lessees can be eliminated completely 
however  none of the violations to date  or the monetary penalties assessed  have been material to us  pvr or  to our knowledge  to pvr s lessees 
pvr does not currently expect that future compliance will have a material adverse effect on pvr 
while it is not possible to quantify the costs of compliance by pvr s lessees with all applicable federal  state and local laws and regulations  those costs have been and are expected to continue to be significant 
the lessees post performance bonds pursuant to federal and state mining laws and regulations for the estimated costs of reclamation and mine closing  including the cost of treating mine water discharge when necessary 
we do not accrue for such costs because pvr s lessees are contractually liable for all costs relating to their mining operations  including the costs of reclamation and mine closure 
however  pvr does require some smaller lessees to deposit into escrow certain funds for reclamation and mine closure costs or post performance bonds for these costs 
although the lessees typically accrue adequate amounts for these costs  their future operating results would be adversely affected if they later determined these accruals to be insufficient 
compliance with these laws and regulations has substantially increased the cost of coal mining for all domestic coal producers 
in addition  the utility industry  which is the most significant end user of coal  is subject to extensive regulation regarding the environmental impact of its power generation activities which could affect demand for coal mined by pvr s lessees 
the possibility exists that new legislation or regulations may be adopted which have a significant impact on the mining operations of pvr s lessees or their customers ability to use coal and may require pvr  its lessees or their customers to change operations significantly or incur substantial costs 
air emissions 
the federal clean air act and corresponding state and local laws and regulations affect all aspects of pvr s business 
the clean air act directly impacts pvr s lessees coal mining and processing operations by imposing permitting requirements and  in some cases  requirements to install certain emissions control equipment  on sources that emit various hazardous and non hazardous air pollutants 
the clean air act also indirectly affects coal mining operations by extensively regulating the air emissions of coal fired electric power generating plants 
there have been a series of recent federal rulemakings that are focused on emissions from coal fired electric generating facilities 
installation of additional emissions control technology and additional measures required under us environmental protection agency epa laws and regulations will make it more costly to operate coal fired power plants and  depending on the requirements of individual state implementation plans  could make coal a less attractive fuel alternative in the planning and building of power plants in the future 
any reduction in coal s share of power generating capacity could negatively impact pvr s lessees ability to sell coal  which could have a material effect on pvr s coal royalty revenues 
the epa s acid rain program  provided in title iv of the clean air act  regulates emissions of sulfur dioxide from electric generating facilities 
sulfur dioxide is a by product of coal combustion 
affected facilities purchase or are otherwise allocated sulfur dioxide emissions allowances  which must be surrendered annually in an amount equal to a facility s sulfur dioxide emissions in that year 
affected facilities may sell or trade excess allowances to other facilities that require additional allowances to offset their sulfur dioxide emissions 
in addition to purchasing or trading for additional sulfur dioxide allowances  affected power facilities can satisfy the requirements of the epa s acid rain program by switching to lower sulfur fuels  installing pollution control devices such as flue gas desulfurization systems  or scrubbers  or by reducing electricity generating levels 
the epa has promulgated rules  referred to as the nox sip call  that require coal fired power plants and other large stationary sources in eastern states and washington dc to make substantial reductions in nitrogen oxide emissions in an effort to reduce the impacts of ozone transport between states 
additionally  in march  the epa issued the final clean air interstate rule cair  which will permanently cap nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide emissions in eastern states and washington  d 
c beginning in and  respectively 
cair requires these states to achieve the required emission reductions by requiring power plants to either participate in an epa administered cap and trade program that caps emission in two phases  or by meeting an individual state emissions budget through measures established by the state 
in march  the epa finalized the clean air mercury rule camr  which establishes a two part  nationwide cap on mercury emissions from coal fired power plants beginning in while currently the subject of extensive controversy and litigation  if fully implemented  camr would permit states to implement their own mercury control regulations or participate in an interstate cap and trade program for mercury emission allowances 
the epa has adopted new  more stringent national air quality standards for ozone and fine particulate matter 
as a result  some states will be required to amend their existing state implementation plans to attain and maintain compliance with the new air quality standards 
for example  in december  the epa designated specific areas in the united states as in non attainment with the new national ambient air quality standard for fine particulate matter 
in november  the epa published proposed rules addressing how states would implement plans to bring applicable non attainment regions into compliance with the new air quality standard 
under the epa s proposed rulemaking  states would have until april to submit their implementation plans to the epa for approval 
because coal mining operations and coal fired electric generating facilities emit particulate matter  pvr s lessees mining operations and their customers could be affected when the new standards are implemented by the applicable states 
in june  the epa announced final amendments to its regional haze program originally developed in to improve visibility in national parks and wilderness areas 
as part of the new rules  affected states must develop implementation plans by december that  among other things  identify facilities that will have to reduce emissions and comply with stricter emission limitations 
this program may restrict construction of new coal fired power plants where emissions are projected to reduce visibility in protected areas 
in addition  this program may require certain existing coal fired power plants to install emissions control equipment to reduce haze causing emissions such as sulfur dioxide  nitrogen oxide and particulate matter 
the us department of justice  on behalf of the epa  has filed lawsuits against a number of coal fired electric generating facilities alleging violations of the new source review provisions of the clean air act 
the epa has alleged that certain modifications have been made to these facilities without first obtaining certain permits issued under the new source review program 
several of these lawsuits have settled  but others remain pending 
depending on the ultimate resolution of these cases  demand for pvr s coal could be affected  which could have an adverse effect on pvr s coal royalty revenues 
carbon dioxide emissions 
the kyoto protocol to the united nations framework convention on climate change calls for developed nations to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases to five percent below levels by carbon dioxide  which is a major byproduct of the combustion of coal and other fossil fuels  is subject to the kyoto protocol 
the kyoto protocol went into effect on february  for those nations that ratified the treaty 
in  the united states withdrew its support for the kyoto protocol 
as the kyoto protocol becomes effective  there will likely be increasing international pressure on the united states to adopt mandatory restrictions on carbon dioxide emissions 
the united states congress has considered bills in the past that would regulate domestic carbon dioxide emissions  but such bills have not yet received sufficient congressional support for passage into law 
several states have also either passed legislation or announced initiatives focused on decreasing or stabilizing carbon dioxide emissions associated with the combustion of fossil fuels  and many of these measures have focused on emissions from coal fired electric generating facilities 
for example  in december  seven northeastern states agreed to implement a regional cap and trade program to stabilize carbon dioxide emissions from regional power plants beginning in it is possible that future federal and state initiatives to control carbon dioxide emissions could result in increased costs associated with coal consumption  such as costs to install additional controls to reduce carbon dioxide emissions or costs to purchase emissions reduction credits to comply with future emissions trading programs 
such increased costs for coal consumption could result in some customers switching to alternative sources of fuel  which could negatively impact pvr s lessees coal sales  and thereby have an adverse affect on pvr s coal royalty revenues 
surface mining control and reclamation act of the surface mining control and reclamation act of smcra and similar state statutes impose on mine operators the responsibility of restoring the land to its original state and compensating the landowner for types of damages occurring as a result of mining operations  and require mine operators to post performance bonds to ensure compliance with any reclamation obligations 
regulatory authorities may attempt to assign the liabilities of pvr s coal lessees to it if any of those lessees are not financially capable of fulfilling those obligations 
in conjunction with mining the property  pvr s coal lessees are contractually obligated under the terms of their leases to comply with all state and local laws  including smcra  with obligations including the reclamation and restoration of the mined areas by grading  shaping and reseeding the soil 
upon completion of the mining  reclamation generally is completed by seeding with grasses or planting trees for use as pasture or timberland  as specified in the approved reclamation plan 
hazardous materials and wastes 
the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla or the superfund law  and analogous state laws  impose liability  without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct  on certain classes of persons that are considered to have contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment 
these persons include the owner or operator of the site where the release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site 
persons who are or were responsible for releases of hazardous substances under cercla may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment and for damages to natural resources 
some products used by coal companies in operations generate waste containing hazardous substances 
pvr could become liable under federal and state superfund and waste management statutes if pvr s lessees are unable to pay environmental cleanup costs 
cercla authorizes the epa and  in some cases  third parties  to take actions in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek recovery from the responsible classes of persons the costs they incurred in connection with such response 
it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances or other wastes released into the environment 
water discharges 
pvr s coal lessees operations can result in discharges of pollutants into waters 
the clean water act and analogous state laws and regulations impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into waters of the united states or state waters 
the unpermitted discharge of pollutants such as from spill or leak incidents is prohibited 
the clean water act and regulations implemented thereunder also prohibit discharges of fill material and certain other activities in wetlands unless authorized by an appropriately issued permit 
pvr s lessees mining operations are strictly regulated by the clean water act  particularly with respect to the discharge of overburden and fill material into jurisdictional waters  including wetlands 
recent federal district court decisions in west virginia  and related litigation filed in federal district court in kentucky  have created uncertainty regarding the future ability to obtain certain general permits authorizing the construction of valley fills for the disposal of overburden from mining operations 
a july decision by the southern district of west virginia in ohio valley environmental coalition v 
bulen enjoined the huntington district of the us army corps of engineers from issuing further permits pursuant to nationwide permit  which is a general permit issued by the us army corps of engineers to streamline the process for obtaining permits under section of the clean water act 
while the decision was vacated by the fourth circuit court of appeals in november  a similar lawsuit has been filed in federal district court in kentucky that seeks to enjoin the issuance of permits pursuant to nationwide permit by the louisville district of the us army corps of engineers 
in the event similar lawsuits prove to be successful in adjoining jurisdictions  pvr s lessees may be required to apply for individual discharge permits pursuant to section of the clean water act in areas where they would have otherwise utilized nationwide permit such a change could result in delays in pvr s lessees obtaining the required mining permits to conduct their operations  which could in turn have an adverse effect on pvr s coal royalty revenues 
the clean water act also requires states to develop anti degradation policies to ensure non impaired waterbodies in the state do not fall below applicable water quality standards 
these and other regulatory developments may restrict pvr s lessees ability to develop new mines or could require its lessees to modify existing operations  which could have an adverse effect on pvr s coal business 
the federal safe drinking water act sdwa and its state equivalents affect coal mining operations by imposing requirements on the underground injection of fine coal slurries  fly ash and flue gas scrubber sludge  and by requiring permits to conduct such underground injection activities 
in addition to establishing the underground injection control program  the sdwa also imposes regulatory requirements on owners and operators of public water systems 
this regulatory program could impact pvr s lessees reclamation operations where subsidence or other mining related problems require the provision of drinking water to affected adjacent homeowners 
mine health and safety laws 
the operations of pvr s lessees are subject to stringent health and safety standards that have been imposed by federal legislation since the adoption of the mine health and safety act of the mine health and safety act of resulted in increased operating costs and reduced productivity 
the mine safety and health act of  which significantly expanded the enforcement of health and safety standards of the mine health and safety act of  imposes comprehensive health and safety standards on all mining operations 
in addition  as part of the mine health and safety acts of and  the black lung acts require payments of benefits by all businesses conducting current mining operations to coal miners with black lung or pneumoconiosis and to some beneficiaries of miners who have died from this disease 
recent mining accidents in west virginia and kentucky have received national attention and instigated responses at the state and national level that are likely to result in increased scrutiny of current safety practices and procedures at all mining operations  particularly underground mining operations 
these recent events could also potentially result in the promulgation of more stringent mine safety laws and regulations  or amendments to existing mine safety laws  including increased sanctions for non compliance 
these potential future mine safety laws and regulations  or amendments to existing mine safety laws  and the cost of compliance with such  could adversely affect pvr s lessees coal production  which could have an adverse affect on pvr s coal royalty revenues 
mining permits and approvals 
numerous governmental permits or approvals are required for mining operations 
in connection with obtaining these permits and approvals  pvr s lessees may be required to prepare and present to federal  state or local authorities data pertaining to the effect or impact that any proposed production of coal may have upon the environment 
the requirements imposed by any of these authorities may be costly and time consuming and may delay commencement or continuation of mining operations 
in order to obtain mining permits and approvals from state regulatory authorities  mine operators  including pvr s lessees  must submit a reclamation plan for restoring  upon the completion of mining operations  the mined property to its prior condition  productive use or other permitted condition 
typically  pvr s lessees submit the necessary permit applications between and months before they plan to begin mining a new area 
in pvr s experience  permits generally are approved within months after a completed application is submitted 
in the past  pvr s lessees have generally obtained their mining permits without significant delay 
pvr s lessees have obtained or applied for permits to mine a majority of the reserves that are currently planned to be mined over the next five years 
pvr s lessees are also in the planning phase for obtaining permits for the additional reserves planned to be mined over the following five years 
however  there are no assurances that they will not experience difficulty in obtaining mining permits in the future

natural gas midstream general regulation 
the partnership s natural gas gathering facilities generally are exempt from the ferc s jurisdiction under the nga  but ferc regulation nevertheless could significantly affect its gathering business and the market for its services 
in recent years  the ferc has pursued pro competitive policies in its regulation of interstate natural gas pipelines into which the partnership s gathering pipelines deliver 
however  we cannot assure you that the ferc will continue this approach as it considers matters such as pipeline rates and rules and policies that may affect rights of access to natural gas transportation capacity 
in texas  the partnership s gathering facilities are subject to regulation by the texas railroad commission  which has the authority to ensure that rates  terms and conditions of gas utilities  including certain gathering facilities  are just and reasonable and not discriminatory 
the partnership s operations in oklahoma are regulated by the oklahoma corporation commission  which prohibits it from charging any unduly discriminatory fees for its gathering services 
we cannot predict whether the partnership s gathering rates will be found to be unjust  unreasonable or unduly discriminatory 
the partnership is subject to ratable take and common purchaser statutes in texas and oklahoma 
ratable take statutes generally require gatherers to take  without undue discrimination  natural gas production that may be tendered to the gatherer for handling 
similarly  common purchaser statutes generally require gatherers to purchase without undue discrimination as to source of supply or producer 
these statutes have the effect of restricting the partnership s right as an owner of gathering facilities to decide with whom it contracts to purchase or transport natural gas 
federal law leaves any economic regulation of natural gas gathering to the states  and texas and oklahoma have adopted complaint based regulation that generally allows natural gas producers and shippers to file complaints with state regulators in an effort to resolve grievances relating to natural gas gathering rates and access 
we cannot assure you that federal and state authorities will retain their current regulatory policies in the future 
texas and oklahoma administer federal pipeline safety standards under the ngpsa  which requires certain pipelines to comply with safety standards in constructing and operating the pipelines  and subjects pipelines to regular inspections 
in response to recent pipeline accidents  congress and the us department of transportation have recently instituted heightened pipeline safety requirements 
certain of the partnership s gathering facilities are exempt from these federal pipeline safety requirements under the rural gathering exemption 
we cannot assure you that the rural gathering exemption will be retained in its current form in the future 
failure to comply with applicable regulations under the nga  the ngpsa and certain state laws can result in the imposition of administrative  civil and criminal remedies 
air emissions 
pvr s midstream operations are subject to the clean air act and comparable state laws and regulations 
see item  business regulation coal air emissions 
these laws and regulations govern emissions of pollutants into the air resulting from the activities of pvr s processing plants and compressor stations and also impose procedural requirements on how pvr conducts its midstream operations 
such laws and regulations may include requirements that pvr obtain pre approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce air emissions  strictly comply with the emissions and operational limitations of air emissions permits pvr is required to obtain or utilize specific equipment or technologies to control emissions 
pvr s failure to comply with these requirements could subject pvr to monetary penalties  injunctions  conditions or restrictions on operations  and potentially criminal enforcement actions 
pvr will be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the future for air pollution control equipment in connection with obtaining and maintaining operating permits and approvals for air emissions 
hazardous materials and wastes 
pvr s midstream operations could incur liability under cercla and comparable state laws resulting from the disposal or other release of hazardous substances or wastes originating from properties pvr owns or operates  regardless of whether such disposal or release occurred during or prior to pvr s acquisition of such properties 
see item  business regulation coal hazardous materials and waste 
although petroleum  including natural gas and ngls are generally excluded from cercla s definition of hazardous substance  pvr s midstream operations do generate wastes in the course of ordinary operations that may fall within the definition of a hazardous substance 
pvr s midstream operations generate wastes  including some hazardous wastes  that are subject to the resource conservation and recovery act rcra and comparable state laws 
however  rcra currently exempts many natural gas gathering and field processing wastes from classification as hazardous waste 
specifically  rcra excludes from the definition of hazardous waste produced waters and other wastes associated with the exploration  development or production of crude oil  natural gas or geothermal energy 
unrecovered petroleum product wastes  however  may still be regulated under rcra as solid waste 
moreover  ordinary industrial wastes such as paint wastes  waste solvents  laboratory wastes and waste compressor oils may be regulated as hazardous waste 
the transportation of natural gas and ngls in pipelines may also generate some hazardous wastes 
although we believe it is unlikely that the rcra exemption will be repealed in the near future  repeal would increase costs for waste disposal and environmental remediation at pvr s facilities 
pvr currently owns or leases numerous properties that for many years have been used for the measurement  gathering  field compression and processing of natural gas and ngls 
although we believe that the operators of such properties used operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time  hydrocarbons or wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under such properties or on or under other locations where such wastes have been taken for disposal 
these properties and the substances disposed or released on them may be subject to cercla  rcra and analogous state laws 
under such laws  pvr could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes including waste disposed of or released by prior owners or operators or property contamination including groundwater contamination  whether from prior owners or operators or other historic activities or spills or to perform remedial plugging or pit closure operations to prevent future contamination 
pvr has ongoing remediation projects underway at several sites  but it does not believe that the costs associated with such cleanups will have a material adverse impact on pvr s operations or revenues 
water discharges 
pvr s midstream operations are subject to the clean water act 
see item  business regulation coal water discharges 
any unpermitted release of pollutants  including ngls or condensates  from pvr s systems or facilities could result in fines or penalties as well as significant remedial obligations

however  the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of  or that we may currently deem immaterial  may become important factors that harm our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations could suffer 
risks related to our oil and gas business competition within our industry may adversely affect our operations 
the oil and natural gas industry is very competitive  and we compete with a substantial number of other companies that are large  well established and have greater financial and operational resources than we do  which may adversely affect our ability to compete or grow our business 
many such companies not only engage in the acquisition  exploration  development and production of oil and natural gas reserves  but also carry on refining operations  electricity generation and the marketing of refined products 
competition is particularly intense in the acquisition of prospective oil and natural gas properties and oil and gas reserves 
our competitive position depends on our geological  geophysical and engineering expertise  our financial resources  our ability to develop properties and our ability to select  acquire and develop proved reserves 
we compete with other oil and natural gas companies in attempting to secure drilling rigs and other equipment necessary for drilling and completion of wells and recruiting and retaining qualified personnel  including geologists  geo physicists  engineers and other specialists 
such equipment and labor may be in short supply from time to time 
shortages of equipment  labor or materials may result in increased costs or the inability to obtain such resources as needed 
we also compete with major and independent oil and gas companies in the marketing and sale of oil and natural gas  and the oil and natural gas industry in general competes with other industries supplying energy and fuel to industrial  commercial and individual consumers 
natural gas and crude oil prices are volatile  and a substantial or extended decline in prices would hurt our profitability and financial condition 
our revenues  operating results  cash flow  profitability  future rate of growth and the carrying value of our oil and gas properties depend heavily on prevailing market prices for natural gas and crude oil 
historically  natural gas and crude oil prices have been volatile  and they are likely to continue to be volatile 
wide fluctuations in natural gas and crude oil prices may result from relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and gas  market uncertainty and other factors that are beyond our control  including domestic and foreign supplies of oil and natural gas  political and economic conditions in oil or gas producing regions  overall domestic and foreign economic conditions  prices and availability of alternative fuels  the availability of transportation facilities  weather conditions  and domestic and foreign governmental regulation 
some of our projections and estimates are based on assumptions as to the future prices of natural gas and crude oil 
these price assumptions are used for planning purposes 
we expect our assumptions will change over time and that actual prices in the future will likely differ from our estimates 
any substantial or extended decline in the actual prices of natural gas or crude oil would have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations including reduced cash flow and borrowing capacity  the quantities of natural gas and crude oil reserves that we can economically produce  the quantity of estimated proved reserves that may be attributed to our properties and our ability to fund our capital program 
our future performance depends on our ability to find or acquire additional oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable 
unless we successfully replace the reserves that we produce  our reserves will decline  eventually resulting in a decrease in oil and gas production and lower revenues and cash flows from operations 
we have historically succeeded in substantially replacing reserves through acquisitions  exploration and development 
we have conducted such activities on our existing oil and gas properties as well as on newly acquired properties 
we may not be able to continue to replace reserves from such activities at acceptable costs 
lower oil and gas prices may further limit the types of reserves that can be developed at acceptable costs 
lower prices also decrease our cash flows and may cause us to reduce capital expenditures 
the business of exploring for  developing or acquiring reserves is capital intensive 
we may not be able to make the necessary capital investments to maintain or expand our oil and gas reserves if cash flows from operations are reduced and external sources of capital become limited or unavailable 
in addition  exploration and development activities involve numerous risks that may result in dry holes  the failure to produce oil and gas in commercial quantities and the inability to fully produce discovered reserves 
we are continually identifying and evaluating acquisition opportunities  including acquisitions that would be significantly larger than those we have consummated to date 
however  competition for producing oil and gas properties is intense and many of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than those available to us 
we cannot ensure that we will successfully consummate any acquisition  that we will be able to acquire producing oil and gas properties that contain economically recoverable reserves or that any acquisition will be profitably integrated into our operations 
we may not be able to fund our planned capital expenditures 
we make  and will continue to make  substantial capital expenditures to find  acquire  develop  exploit and produce oil and natural gas reserves 
our capital expenditures for oil and gas properties were million for  and we have budgeted total capital expenditures of million in if oil and gas prices decrease or we encounter operating difficulties that result in our cash flow from operations being less than expected  we may have to reduce the capital we can spend unless we raise additional funds through debt or equity financing 
debt or equity financing  cash generated by operations or borrowing capacity may not be available to us in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms to meet these requirements 
future cash flows and the availability of financing will be subject to a number of variables  such as our success in locating and producing new reserves  the level of production from existing wells  and prices of oil and natural gas 
issuing equity securities to satisfy our financing requirements could cause substantial dilution to existing shareholders 
debt financing could lead to us being more vulnerable to competitive pressures and economic downturns 
if our revenues were to decrease due to lower oil and natural gas prices  decreased production or other reasons  and if we could not obtain capital through our credit facility or otherwise  our ability to execute our development plans  replace our reserves or maintain production levels could be greatly limited 
exploration and development drilling may not result in commercially productive reserves 
oil and gas drilling and production activities are subject to numerous risks  including the risk that no commercially productive natural gas or oil reserves will be found 
the costs of drilling  completing and operating wells are often uncertain  and drilling operations may be curtailed  delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include unexpected drilling conditions  pressure or irregularities in formations  equipment failures or accidents  shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs and the delivery of equipment  shortages in experienced labor  failure to secure necessary regulatory approvals and permits  fires  explosions  blow outs and surface cratering  and adverse weather conditions 
the prevailing prices of oil and gas also affect the cost of and the demand for drilling rigs  production equipment and related services 
the availability of drilling rigs can vary significantly from region to region at any particular time 
although land drilling rigs can be moved from one region to another in response to changes in levels of demand  an undersupply of rigs in any region may result in drilling delays and higher drilling costs for the rigs that are available in that region 
another significant risk inherent in our drilling plans is the need to obtain drilling permits from state  local and other governmental authorities 
delays in obtaining regulatory approvals and drilling permits  including delays which jeopardize our ability to realize the potential benefits from leased properties within the applicable lease periods  the failure to obtain a drilling permit for a well or the receipt of a permit with unreasonable conditions or costs could have a material adverse effect on our ability to explore on or develop our properties 
the wells we drill may not be productive and we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in such wells 
the seismic data and other technologies we use do not allow us to know conclusively prior to drilling a well that natural gas or oil is present or may be produced economically 
the cost of drilling  completing and operating a well is often uncertain  and cost factors can adversely affect the economics of a project 
drilling activities can result in dry wells or wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient net revenues after operating and other costs to cover initial drilling costs 
our future drilling activities may not be successful  nor can we be sure that our overall drilling success rate or our drilling success rate for activity within a particular area will not decline 
unsuccessful drilling activities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
also  we may not be able to obtain any options or lease rights in potential drilling locations that we identify 
although we have identified numerous potential drilling locations  we may not be able to economically produce oil or natural gas from all of them 
our business involves many operating risks that may result in substantial losses for which insurance may be unavailable or inadequate 
our operations are subject to all of the risks and hazards typically associated with the exploitation  development and exploration for  and the production and transportation of oil and natural gas 
these operating risks include fires  explosions  blowouts  cratering and casing collapses  formations with abnormal pressures  pipeline ruptures or spills  uncontrollable flows of oil  natural gas or well fluids  environmental hazards such as natural gas leaks  oil spills and discharges of toxic gases  and natural disasters 
any of these risks could result in substantial losses resulting from injury or loss of life  damage to or destruction of property  natural resources and equipment  pollution and other environmental damages  clean up responsibilities  regulatory investigations and penalties and suspension of operations 
in addition  under certain circumstances  we may be liable for environmental damage caused by previous owners or operators of properties that we own  lease or operate 
as a result  we may incur substantial liabilities to third parties or governmental entities  which could reduce or eliminate funds available for exploration  development or acquisitions or cause us to incur losses 
in accordance with industry practice  we maintain insurance against some  but not all  of the risks described above 
we cannot assure you that our insurance will be adequate to cover losses or liabilities 
also  we cannot predict the continued availability of insurance at premium levels that justify its purchase 
no assurance can be given that we will be able to maintain insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable 
the occurrence of a significant event  not fully insured or indemnified against  could have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and operations 
our business depends on transportation facilities owned by others 
we deliver substantially all of our oil and natural gas production through pipelines that we do not own 
the marketability of our production depends upon the availability  proximity and capacity of these pipelines as well as gathering systems and processing facilities 
the unavailability of or lack of available capacity on these systems and facilities could result in the shut in of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of development plans for properties 
federal  state and local regulation of oil and natural gas production and transportation  tax and energy policies  changes in supply and demand  pipeline pressures  damage to or destruction of pipelines and general economic conditions could adversely affect our ability to produce  gather and market our oil and natural gas 
competition for experienced  technical personnel may negatively impact our operations 
our exploratory and development drilling success will depend  in part  on our ability to attract and retain experienced professional personnel 
the loss of any key executives or other key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
our future profitability will depend  at least in part  on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel  particularly individuals with a strong background in geology  geophysics  engineering and operations 
estimates of oil and natural gas reserves are not precise 
this form k contains estimates of our proved oil and gas reserves and the estimated future net cash flows from such reserves 
these estimates are based upon various assumptions  including assumptions required by the sec relating to oil and natural gas prices  drilling and operating expenses  capital expenditures  taxes and availability of funds 
the process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex 
this process requires significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data for each reservoir 
these estimates are dependent on many variables and  therefore  changes often occur as these variables evolve and commodity prices fluctuate 
actual future production  oil and gas prices  revenues  taxes  development expenditures  operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves will most likely vary from those estimated 
any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves disclosed by us 
in addition  we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history  results of exploration and development  prevailing oil and gas prices and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
at december   approximately percent of our estimated proved reserves were proved undeveloped 
estimation of proved undeveloped reserves and proved developed non producing reserves is based on volumetric calculations and adjacent reserve performance data 
recovery of proved undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations 
production revenues from proved developed non producing reserves will not be realized until some time in the future 
the reserve data assumes that we will make significant capital expenditures to develop our reserves 
although we have prepared estimates of our reserves and the costs associated with these reserves in accordance with industry standards  these estimated costs may not be accurate  development may not occur as scheduled and actual results may not occur as estimated 
you should not assume that the present value of estimated future net cash flow referred to herein is the current fair value of our estimated oil and gas reserves 
in accordance with sec requirements  we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on prices and costs on the date of the estimate 
actual current and future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of the estimate 
as a result  net present value estimates using actual prices and costs may be significantly less than the sec estimate that is provided herein 
in addition  the percent discount factor  which is required by the sec to be used in calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting purposes  is not necessarily the most accurate discount factor for us 
we have limited control over the activities on properties we do not operate 
other companies operate a portion of our net production 
in  other companies operated approximately percent of our net production 
our success in properties operated by others will depend upon a number of factors outside of our control  including timing and amount of capital expenditures  the operator s expertise and financial resources  approval of other participants in drilling wells  selection of technology and maintenance of safety and environmental standards 
we have limited ability to influence or control the operation or future development of these non operated properties or the amount of capital expenditures that we are required to fund for their operation 
our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects and our limited ability to influence or control the operation and future development of these properties could have a material adverse effect on the realization of our targeted returns or lead to unexpected future costs 
our producing property acquisitions carry significant risks 
acquisition of producing oil and gas properties is a key element of maintaining and growing reserves and production 
competition for these assets has been and will continue to be intense 
the success of any acquisition will depend on a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include the purchase price  future oil and gas prices  the ability to reasonably estimate or assess the recoverable volumes of reserves  rates of future production and future net revenues attainable from reserves  future operating and capital costs  results of future exploration  exploitation and development activities on the acquired properties and future abandonment and possible future environmental or other liabilities 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves  actual future production rates and associated costs and potential liabilities with respect to prospective acquisition targets 
actual results may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates 
a customary review of subject properties will not necessarily reveal all existing or potential problems 
additionally  significant acquisitions can change the nature of our operations and business depending upon the character of the acquired properties if they have substantially different operating and geological characteristics or are in different geographic locations than our existing properties 
to the extent that acquired properties are substantially different than our existing properties  our ability to efficiently realize the expected economic benefits of such transactions may be limited 
integrating acquired businesses and properties involves a number of special risks 
these risks include the possibility that management may be distracted from regular business concerns by the need to integrate operations and systems and that unforeseen difficulties can arise in integrating operations and systems and in retaining and assimilating employees 
any of these or other similar risks could lead to potential adverse short term or long term effects on our operating results  and may cause us to not be able to realize any or all of the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions 
responses to recent coal mining accidents could have an adverse effect on our operations 
our conventional and cbm drilling operations in appalachia take place in close proximity to coal mining operations 
recent coal mining disasters in west virginia and kentucky have received state and national attention that is resulting in increased scrutiny of current safety practices and procedures at and around coal mining operations 
this scrutiny could result in the promulgation of more stringent regulations for the permitting of oil and gas wells in close proximity to coal mining operations  which could make it more difficult  time consuming and costly for us to obtain such permits and could adversely affect our natural gas production and reduce our oil and natural gas revenues 
hedging transactions may limit our potential gains and involve other risks 
in order to manage our exposure to price risks in the marketing of our oil and natural gas  we periodically enter into oil and gas price hedging arrangements with respect to a portion of our expected production 
our hedges are limited in duration  usually for periods of two years or less 
while intended to reduce the effects of volatile oil and natural gas prices  such transactions may limit our potential gains if oil or natural gas prices were to rise over the price established by the hedging arrangements 
in trying to maintain an appropriate balance  we may end up hedging too much or too little  depending upon how oil or natural gas prices fluctuate in the future 
we cannot assure you that our hedging transactions will reduce the risk or minimize the effect of any decline in oil or natural gas prices 
in addition  hedging transactions may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances  including instances in which our production is less than expected  there is a widening of price basis differentials between delivery points for our production and the delivery point assumed in the hedge arrangement  the counterparties to our futures contracts fail to perform under the contracts  or a sudden  unexpected event materially impacts oil or natural gas prices 
we account for our derivative transactions pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which requires us to record each hedging transaction as an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
we must also measure the effectiveness of our hedging position in relation to the underlying commodity being hedged  and we will be required to record the ineffective portion of the hedge in our net income for that period 
this accounting treatment could result in significant fluctuations in net income and shareholders equity from period to period 
in addition  hedging transactions using derivative instruments involve basis risk 
basis risk in a hedging contract occurs when the index upon which the contract is based is more or less variable than the index upon which the hedged asset is based  thereby making the hedge less effective 
for example  a nymex index used for hedging certain volumes of production may have more or less variability than the regional price index used for the sale of that production 
we are subject to complex laws and regulations that can adversely affect the cost  manner or feasibility of doing business 
exploration  development  production and sale of oil and gas are subject to extensive federal  state and local laws and regulations  including complex environmental laws 
future laws or regulations  any adverse changes in the interpretation of existing laws and regulations  inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or a failure to comply with existing legal requirements may harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we may be required to make large expenditures to comply with environmental and other governmental regulations 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the suspension or termination of operations and subject us to administrative  civil and criminal penalties 
matters subject to regulation include discharge permits for drilling operations  drilling bonds  spacing of wells  unitization and pooling of properties  environmental protection and taxation 
our operations create the risk of environmental liabilities to the government or third parties for any unlawful discharge of oil  gas or other pollutants into the air  soil or water 
in the event of environmental violations  we may be charged with remedial costs 
laws and regulations protecting the environment have become more stringent in recent years  and may  in some circumstances  result in liability for environmental damage regardless of negligence or fault 
in addition  pollution and similar environmental risks generally are not fully insurable 
these liabilities and costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
see item  business regulation oil and gas environmental matters 
risks related to our ownership in pvr we rely upon distributions from the partnership  and the amount of cash that the partnership will be able to distribute to its unitholders principally depends upon the amount of cash it can generate from its coal and natural gas midstream businesses 
we received million of distributions from the partnership in a significant decline in the partnership s earnings or cash distributions would have a negative impact on us 
the amount of cash that the partnership will be able to distribute each quarter to its unitholders  including us  principally depends upon the amount of cash it can generate from its coal and midstream businesses 
the amount of cash that the partnership will generate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on  among other things the amount of coal its lessees are able to produce  the price at which its lessees are able to sell the coal  the lessees timely receipt of payment from their customers  the amount of natural gas transported in its gathering systems  the amount of throughput in its processing plants  the price of natural gas  the price of ngls  the relationship between natural gas and ngl prices  the fees it charges and the margins it realizes for its midstream services  and its hedging activities 
in addition  the actual amount of cash that the partnership will have available for distribution will depend on other factors  some of which are beyond its control  including the level of capital expenditures it makes  the cost of acquisitions  if any  its debt service requirements  fluctuations in its working capital needs  restrictions on distributions contained in its debt agreements  prevailing economic conditions  and the amount of cash reserves established by its general partner in its sole discretion for the proper conduct of its business 
because of these factors  the partnership may not have sufficient available cash each quarter to pay its current declared quarterly distribution of per unit or any other amount 
you should also be aware that the amount of cash that the partnership will have available for distribution depends primarily upon its cash flow  including cash flow from financial reserves and working capital borrowings  and is not solely a function of profitability  which will be affected by non cash items 
as a result  the partnership may make cash distributions during periods when it records losses and may not make cash distributions during periods when it records profits 
risks related to pvr s coal business if the partnership s lessees do not manage their operations well  their production volumes and the partnership s coal royalty revenues could decrease 
the partnership depends on its lessees to effectively manage their operations on its properties 
the partnership s lessees make their own business decisions with respect to their operations  including decisions relating to the method of mining  credit review of their customers  marketing of the coal mined  coal transportation arrangements  negotiations with unions  employee wages  permitting  surety bonding  and mine closure and reclamation 
if the partnership s lessees do not manage their operations well  their production could be reduced  which would result in lower coal royalty revenues to the partnership and could adversely affect its ability to make its quarterly distributions 
coal mining operations are subject to numerous operational risks that could result in lower coal royalty revenues 
the partnership s coal royalty revenues are largely dependent on the level of production from its coal reserves achieved by its lessees 
the level of its lessees production is subject to operating conditions or events beyond their or its control  including the inability to acquire necessary permits  changes or variations in geologic conditions  such as the thickness of the coal deposits and the amount of rock embedded in or overlying the coal deposit  changes in governmental regulation of the coal industry  mining and processing equipment failures and unexpected maintenance problems  adverse claims to title or existing defects of title  interruptions due to power outages  adverse weather and natural disasters  such as heavy rains and flooding  labor related interruptions  employee injuries or fatalities  and fires and explosions 
these conditions may increase the partnership s lessees cost of mining and delay or halt production at particular mines for varying lengths of time 
any interruptions to the production of coal from the partnership s reserves could reduce its coal royalty revenues and adversely affect its ability to make its quarterly distributions 
in addition  the partnership s coal royalty revenues are based upon sales of coal by its lessees to their customers 
if its lessees do not receive payments for delivered coal on a timely basis from their customers  their cash flow would be adversely affected  which could cause the partnership s cash flow to be adversely affected and could adversely affect the partnership s ability to make its quarterly distributions 
a substantial or extended decline in coal prices could reduce the partnership s coal royalty revenues and the value of its coal reserves 
a substantial or extended decline in coal prices from recent levels could have a material adverse effect on the partnership s lessees operations and on the quantities of coal that may be economically produced from the partnership s properties 
this  in turn  could reduce the partnership s coal royalty revenues  its coal services revenues and the value of its coal reserves 
additionally  volatility in coal prices could make it difficult to estimate with precision the value of the partnership s coal reserves and any coal reserves that the partnership may consider for acquisition 
the partnership depends on a limited number of primary operators for a significant portion of its coal royalty revenues and the loss of or reduction in production from any of its major lessees could reduce its coal royalty revenues 
the partnership depends on a limited number of primary operators for a significant portion of its coal royalty revenues 
during  five primary operators  each with multiple leases  accounted for percent of its coal royalty revenues 
if any of these operators enters bankruptcy or decide to cease operations or significantly reduce its production  the partnership s coal royalty revenues could be reduced 
a failure on the part of the partnership s lessees to make coal royalty payments could give the partnership the right to terminate the lease  repossess the property or obtain liquidation damages and or enforce payment obligations under the lease 
if the partnership repossessed any of its properties  it would seek to find a replacement lessee 
it may not be able to find a replacement lessee and  if it finds a replacement lessee  it may not be able to enter into a new lease on favorable terms within a reasonable period of time 
in addition  the outgoing lessee could be subject to bankruptcy proceedings that could further delay the execution of a new lease or the assignment of the existing lease to another operator 
if the partnership enters into a new lease  the replacement operator might not achieve the same levels of production or sell coal at the same price as the lessee it replaced 
in addition  it may be difficult for the partnership to secure new or replacement lessees for small or isolated coal reserves  since industry trends toward consolidation favor larger scale  higher technology mining operations to increase productivity rates 
the partnership s coal business will be adversely affected if it is unable to replace or increase its reserves through acquisitions 
because its reserves decline as its lessees mine its coal  the partnership s future success and growth depends  in part  upon its ability to acquire additional coal reserves that are economically recoverable 
if the partnership is unable to negotiate purchase contracts to replace or increase its coal reserves on acceptable terms  its coal royalty revenues will decline as its coal reserves are depleted 
in addition  if the partnership is unable to successfully integrate the companies  businesses or properties it is able to acquire  its coal royalty revenues may decline and the partnership could  therefore  experience a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition or results of operations 
if the partnership acquires additional coal reserves  there is a possibility that any acquisition could be dilutive to earnings and reduce its ability to make distributions to unitholders  including us  or to pay interest on  or the principal of  its debt obligations 
any debt the partnership incurs to finance an acquisition may similarly affect its ability to make distributions to unitholders  including us  or to pay interest on  or the principal of  its debt obligations 
the partnership s ability to make acquisitions in the future also could be limited by restrictions under its existing or future debt agreements  competition from other coal companies for attractive properties or the lack of suitable acquisition candidates 
lessees could satisfy obligations to their customers with coal from properties other than the partnership s  depriving it of the ability to receive amounts in excess of the minimum royalty payments 
the partnership does not control its lessees business operations 
its lessees customer supply contracts do not generally require its lessees to satisfy their obligations to their customers with coal mined from the partnership s reserves 
several factors may influence a lessee s decision to supply its customers with coal mined from properties the partnership does not own or lease  including the royalty rates under the lessee s lease with the partnership  mining conditions  transportation costs and availability and customer coal specifications 
if a lessee satisfies its obligations to its customers with coal from properties the partnership does not own or lease  production under its lease will decrease  and it will receive lower coal royalty revenues 
competition within the coal industry may adversely affect the ability of the partnership s lessees to sell coal at high prices  which could reduce its coal royalty revenues 
the coal industry is intensely competitive primarily as a result of the existence of numerous producers 
the partnership s lessees compete with coal producers in various regions of the united states for domestic sales 
the industry has undergone significant consolidation which has led to some of the competitors of the partnership s lessees having significantly larger financial and operating resources than most of its lessees 
the partnership s lessees compete on the basis of coal price at the mine  coal quality including sulfur content  transportation cost from the mine to the customer and the reliability of supply 
continued demand for the partnership s coal and the prices that its lessees obtain are also affected by demand for electricity  demand for metallurgical coal  access to transportation  environmental and government regulations  technological developments and the availability and price of alternative fuel supplies  including nuclear  natural gas  oil and hydroelectric power 
demand for the partnership s low sulfur coal and the prices its lessees will be able to obtain for it will also be affected by the price and availability of high sulfur coal  which can be marketed in tandem with emissions allowances which permit the high sulfur coal to meet federal clean air act requirements 
competition among coal producers could result in excess production capacity in the industry  resulting in downward pressure on prices 
declining prices reduce the partnership s coal royalty revenues and adversely affect its ability to make distributions to unitholders  including us  and to service its debt obligations 
fluctuations in transportation costs and the availability or reliability of transportation could reduce the production of coal mined from the partnership s properties 
transportation costs represent a significant portion of the total cost of coal for the customers of the partnership s lessees 
increases in transportation costs could make coal a less competitive source of energy or could make coal produced by some or all of the partnership s lessees less competitive than coal produced from other sources 
on the other hand  significant decreases in transportation costs could result in increased competition for the partnership s lessees from coal producers in other parts of the country 
the partnership s lessees depend upon rail  barge  trucking  overland conveyor and other systems to deliver coal to their customers 
disruption of these transportation services due to weather related problems  strikes  lockouts  bottlenecks and other events could temporarily impair the ability of the partnership s lessees to supply coal to their customers 
the partnership s lessees transportation providers may face difficulties in the future and impair the ability of its lessees to supply coal to their customers  thereby resulting in decreased coal royalty revenues to the partnership 
the partnership s lessees could experience labor disruptions  and its lessees workforces could become increasingly unionized in the future 
two of the partnership s lessees each have one mine operated by unionized employees 
one of these mines was the partnership s second largest mine on the basis of coal reserves as of december  all of the partnership s lessees could become increasingly unionized in the future 
if some or all of the partnership s lessees non unionized operations were to become unionized  it could adversely affect their productivity and increase the risk of work stoppages 
in addition  the partnership s lessees operations may be adversely affected by work stoppages at unionized companies  particularly if union workers were to orchestrate boycotts against its lessees operations 
any further unionization of the partnership s lessees employees could adversely affect the stability of production from its reserves and reduce its coal royalty revenues 
the partnership s reserve estimates depend on many assumptions that may be inaccurate  which could materially adversely affect the quantities and value of its reserves 
the partnership s estimates of its reserves may vary substantially from the actual amounts of coal its lessees may be able to economically recover 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of reserves  including many factors beyond the partnership s control 
estimates of coal reserves necessarily depend upon a number of variables and assumptions  any one of which may  if incorrect  result in an estimate that varies considerably from actual results 
these factors and assumptions relate to geological and mining conditions  which may not be fully identified by available exploration data or which differ from the partnership s experiences in areas where its lessees currently mine  the amount of ultimately recoverable coal in the ground  the effects of regulation by governmental agencies  and future coal prices  operating costs  capital expenditures  severance and excise taxes and development and reclamation costs 
actual production  revenues and expenditures with respect to the partnership s reserves will likely vary from estimates  and these variations may be material 
as a result  you should not place undue reliance on the coal reserve data provided herein 
any change in fuel consumption patterns by electric power generators away from the use of coal could affect the ability of the partnership s lessees to sell the coal they produce and thereby reduce its coal royalty revenues 
according to the us department of energy  domestic electric power generation accounts for approximately percent of domestic coal consumption 
the amount of coal consumed for domestic electric power generation is affected primarily by the overall demand for electricity  the price and availability of competing fuels for power plants such as nuclear  natural gas  fuel oil and hydroelectric power and environmental and other governmental regulations 
the partnership believes that most new power plants will be built to produce electricity during peak periods of demand 
many of these new power plants will likely be fired by natural gas because of lower construction costs compared to coal fired plants and because natural gas is a cleaner burning fuel 
the increasingly stringent requirements of the clean air act may result in more electric power generators shifting from coal to natural gas fired power plants 
see item  business regulation coal air emissions 
extensive environmental laws and regulations affecting electric power generators could have corresponding effects on the ability of the partnership s lessees to sell the coal they produce and thereby reduce its coal royalty revenues 
federal  state and local laws and regulations extensively regulate the amount of sulfur dioxide  particulate matter  nitrogen oxides  mercury and other compounds emitted into the air from electric power plants  which are the ultimate consumers of the coal the partnership s lessees produce 
these laws and regulations can require significant emission control expenditures for many coal fired power plants  and various new and proposed laws and regulations may require further emission reductions and associated emission control expenditures 
there is also continuing pressure on state and federal regulators to impose limits on carbon dioxide emissions from electric power plants  particularly coal fired power plants 
as a result of these current and proposed laws  regulations and trends  electricity generators may elect to switch to other fuels that generate less of these emissions  possibly further reducing demand for the coal that the partnership s lessees produce and thereby reducing its coal royalty revenues 
see item  business regulation coal air emissions 
delays in the partnership s lessees obtaining mining permits and approvals  or the inability to obtain required permits and approvals  could have an adverse effect on its coal royalty revenues 
mine operators  including the partnership s lessees  must obtain numerous permits and approvals that impose strict conditions and obligations relating to various environmental and safety matters in connection with coal mining 
the permitting rules are complex and can change over time 
the public has the right to comment on permit applications and otherwise participate in the permitting process  including through court intervention 
accordingly  permits required by the partnership s lessees to conduct operations may not be issued  maintained or renewed  or may not be issued or renewed in a timely fashion  or may involve requirements that restrict its lessees ability to economically conduct their mining operations 
limitations on the partnership s lessees ability to conduct their mining operations due to the inability to obtain or renew necessary permits could have an adverse effect on its coal royalty revenues 
see item  business regulation coal mining permits and approvals 
the partnership s lessees mining operations are subject to extensive and costly laws and regulations  and such current and future laws and regulations could increase operating costs and limit its lessees ability to produce coal  which could have an adverse effect on its coal royalty revenues 
the partnership s lessees are subject to numerous and detailed federal  state and local laws and regulations affecting coal mining operations  including laws and regulations pertaining to employee health and safety  permitting and licensing requirements  air quality standards  water pollution  plant and wildlife protection  reclamation and restoration of mining properties after mining is completed  the discharge of materials into the environment  surface subsidence from underground mining and the effects that mining has on groundwater quality and availability 
numerous governmental permits and approvals are required for mining operations 
the partnership s lessees are required to prepare and present to federal  state or local authorities data pertaining to the effect or impact that any proposed exploration for or production of coal may have upon the environment 
the costs  liabilities and requirements associated with these regulations may be significant and time consuming and may delay commencement or continuation of exploration or production operations 
the possibility exists that new laws or regulations or judicial interpretations of existing laws and regulations may be adopted in the future that could materially affect the partnership s lessees mining operations  either through direct impacts such as new requirements impacting its lessees existing mining operations  or indirect impacts such as new laws and regulations that discourage or limit coal consumers use of coal 
any of these direct or indirect impacts could have an adverse effect on the partnership s coal royalty revenues 
see item  business regulation 
because of extensive and comprehensive regulatory requirements  violations during mining operations are not unusual in the industry and  notwithstanding compliance efforts  the partnership does not believe violations by its lessees can be eliminated completely 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative  civil and criminal penalties  the imposition of cleanup and site restoration costs and liens and  to a lesser extent  the issuance of injunctions to limit or cease operations 
the partnership s lessees may also incur costs and liabilities resulting from claims for damages to property or injury to persons arising from their operations 
if the partnership s lessees are required to pay these costs and liabilities and if their financial viability is affected by doing so  then their mining operations and  as a result  the partnership s coal royalty revenues and its ability to make distributions  could be adversely affected 
recent mining accidents in west virginia and kentucky have received national attention and instigated responses at the state and national level that are likely to result in increased scrutiny of current safety practices and procedures at all mining operations  particularly underground mining operations 
these recent events could also potentially result in the promulgation of more stringent mine safety laws and regulations  or amendments to existing mine safety laws  including increased sanctions for non compliance 
these potential future mine safety laws and regulations or amendments to existing mine safety laws and regulations  and the cost of compliance with such  could adversely affect the partnership s lessees coal production which could have an adverse affect on its coal royalty revenues and its ability to make distributions 
risks related to pvr s midstream business the success of the partnership s midstream business depends upon its ability to find and contract for new sources of natural gas supply 
in order to maintain or increase throughput levels on the partnership s gathering systems and asset utilization rates at its processing plants  the partnership must contract for new natural gas supplies 
the primary factors affecting its ability to connect new supplies of natural gas to its gathering systems include its success in contracting for existing natural gas supplies that are not committed to other systems and the level of drilling activity creating new gas supply near its gathering systems 
the partnership may not be able to obtain additional contracts for natural gas supplies 
fluctuations in energy prices can greatly affect production rates and investments by third parties in the development of new oil and natural gas reserves 
drilling activity generally decreases as oil and natural gas prices decrease 
the partnership has no control over the level of drilling activity in its areas of operations  the amount of reserves underlying the wells and the rate at which production from a well will decline 
in addition  the partnership has no control over producers or their production decisions  which are affected by  among other things  prevailing and projected energy prices  demand for hydrocarbons  the level of reserves  geological considerations  governmental regulation and the availability and cost of capital 
a substantial portion of the partnership s midstream assets  including its gathering systems and processing plants  are connected to natural gas reserves and wells for which the production will naturally decline over time 
the partnership s cash flows associated with these systems will decline unless it is able to access new supplies of natural gas by connecting additional production to these systems 
a material decrease in natural gas production in its areas of operation  as a result of depressed commodity prices or otherwise  would result in a decline in the volume of natural gas the partnership handles  which would reduce its revenues and operating income 
in addition  the partnership s future growth will depend  in part  upon whether it can contract for additional supplies at a greater rate than the rate of natural decline in its currently connected supplies 
the partnership may not be able to retain existing customers or acquire new customers  which would reduce its revenues and limit its future profitability 
the renewal or replacement of existing contracts with the partnership s customers at rates sufficient to maintain current revenues and cash flows depends on a number of factors beyond its control  including competition from other pipelines  and the price of  and demand for  natural gas in the markets the partnership serves 
the profitability of the partnership s midstream business is dependent upon prices and market demand for natural gas and ngls  which are beyond its control and have been volatile 
the partnership is subject to significant risks due to fluctuations in commodity prices 
during  it generated a majority of its gross margin from two types of contractual arrangements under which its margin is exposed to increases and decreases in the price of natural gas and ngls percentage of proceeds and keep whole arrangements 
virtually all of the natural gas gathered on the crescent system and the hamlin system is contracted under percentage of proceeds arrangements 
the natural gas gathered on the beaver system is contracted primarily under either percentage of proceeds or gas purchase keep whole arrangements 
under both types of arrangements  the partnership provides gathering and processing services for natural gas received 
under percentage of proceeds arrangements  the partnership generally sells the ngls produced from the processing operations and the remaining residue gas at market prices and remits to the producers an agreed upon percentage of the proceeds based upon an index price for the gas and the price received for the ngls 
under these percentage of proceeds arrangements  revenues and gross margins decline when natural gas prices and ngl prices decrease 
accordingly  a decrease in the price of natural gas or ngls could have a material adverse effect on the partnership s results of operations 
under gas purchase keep whole arrangements  the partnership generally buys natural gas from producers based upon an index price and then sells the ngls and the remaining residue gas to third parties at market prices 
because the extraction of the ngls from the natural gas during processing reduces the volume of natural gas available for sale  profitability is dependent on the value of those ngls being higher than the value of the volume of gas reduction or shrink 
under these arrangements  revenues and gross margins decrease when the price of natural gas increases relative to the price of ngls 
accordingly  a change in the relationship between the price of natural gas and the price of ngls could have a material adverse effect on the partnership s results of operations 
in the past  the prices of natural gas and ngls have been extremely volatile  and the partnership expects this volatility to continue 
the markets and prices for residue gas and ngls depend upon factors beyond the partnership s control 
these factors include demand for oil  natural gas and ngls  which fluctuates with changes in market and economic conditions  and other factors  including the impact of weather on the demand for oil and natural gas  the level of domestic oil and natural gas production  the availability of imported oil and natural gas  actions taken by foreign oil and gas producing nations  the availability of local  intrastate and interstate transportation systems  the availability and marketing of competitive fuels  the impact of energy conservation efforts  and the extent of governmental regulation and taxation 
the partnership encounters competition from other midstream companies 
the partnership experiences competition in all of its midstream markets 
competition is based on many factors  including geographic proximity to production  costs of connection  available capacity  rates and access to markets 
the partnership s competitors include major integrated oil companies  interstate and intrastate pipelines and companies that gather  compress  process  transport and market natural gas 
many of the partnership s competitors have greater financial resources and access to larger natural gas supplies than it does 
expanding the partnership s midstream business by constructing new gathering systems  pipelines and processing facilities subjects it to construction risks 
one of the ways the partnership may grow its midstream business is through the construction of additions to existing gathering  compression and processing systems 
the construction of a new gathering system or pipeline or the expansion of an existing pipeline  by adding additional horsepower or pump stations or by adding a second pipeline within an existing right of way  and the construction of new processing facilities  involve numerous regulatory  environmental  political and legal uncertainties beyond the partnership s control and require the expenditure of significant amounts of capital 
if the partnership undertakes these projects  they may not be completed on schedule  or at all  or at the budgeted cost 
moreover  the partnership s revenues may not increase immediately upon the expenditure of funds on a particular project 
for example  the construction of gathering facilities requires the expenditure of significant amounts of capital  which may exceed the partnership s estimates 
generally  the partnership may have only limited natural gas supplies committed to these facilities prior to their construction 
moreover  the partnership may construct facilities to capture anticipated future growth in production in a region in which anticipated production growth does not materialize 
as a result  there is the risk that new facilities may not be able to attract enough natural gas to achieve the partnership s expected investment return  which could adversely affect its financial position or results of operations 
if the partnership is unable to obtain new rights of way or the cost of renewing existing rights of way increases  then it may be unable to fully execute its growth strategy and its cash flows could be reduced 
the construction of additions to the partnership s existing gathering assets may require it to obtain new rights of way before constructing new pipelines 
the partnership may be unable to obtain rights of way to connect new natural gas supplies to its existing gathering lines or capitalize on other attractive expansion opportunities 
additionally  it may become more expensive for the partnership to obtain new rights of way or to renew existing rights of way 
if the cost of obtaining new rights of way or renewing existing rights of way increases  then the partnership s cash flows could be reduced 
the partnership is exposed to the credit risk of its midstream customers  and nonpayment or nonperformance by its customers could reduce its cash flows 
the partnership is subject to risk of loss resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by its customers 
the partnership depends on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of its midstream revenue 
for  two customers represented percent of total natural gas midstream revenues and percent of our total consolidated revenues 
any nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers could reduce our cash flows 
any reduction in the capacity of  or the allocations to  the partnership in interconnecting third party pipelines could cause a reduction of volumes processed  which would adversely affect its revenues and cash flow 
the partnership is dependent upon connections to third party pipelines to receive and deliver residue gas and ngls 
any reduction of capacities of these interconnecting pipelines due to testing  line repair  reduced operating pressures or other causes could result in reduced volumes gathered and processed in its midstream facilities 
similarly  if additional shippers begin transporting volumes of residue gas and ngls on interconnecting pipelines  the partnership s allocations in these pipelines would be reduced 
any reduction in volumes gathered and processed in the partnership s facilities would adversely affect its revenues and cash flow 
hedging transactions may limit the partnership s potential gains and involve other risks 
in order to manage its exposure to price risks in the marketing of its natural gas and ngls  the partnership periodically enters into natural gas and ngl price hedging arrangements with respect to a portion of its expected production 
its hedges are limited in duration  usually for periods of two years or less 
however  in connection with acquisitions  sometimes its hedges are for longer periods 
while intended to reduce the effects of volatile natural gas and ngl prices  such transactions may limit the partnership s potential gains if natural gas or ngl prices were to rise over the price established by the hedging arrangements 
in trying to maintain an appropriate balance  the partnership may end up hedging too much or too little  depending upon how natural gas or ngl prices fluctuate in the future 
we cannot assure you that the partnership s hedging transactions will reduce the risk or minimize the effect of any decline in natural gas or ngl prices 
in addition  hedging transactions may expose the partnership to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances  including instances in which its production is less than expected  there is a widening of price basis differentials between delivery points for its production and the delivery point assumed in the hedge arrangement  the counterparties to its futures contracts fail to perform under the contracts  or a sudden  unexpected event materially impacts natural gas or ngl prices 
the partnership accounts for its derivative transactions pursuant to sfas no 
 which requires it to record each hedging transaction as an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
the partnership must also measure the effectiveness of its hedging position in relation to the underlying commodity being hedged  and the partnership will be required to record the ineffective portion of the hedge in its net income for that period 
this accounting treatment could result in significant fluctuations in our net income and shareholders equity from period to period 
in addition  hedging transactions using derivative instruments involve basis risk 
basis risk in a hedging contract occurs when the index upon which the contract is based is more or less variable than the index upon which the hedged asset is based  thereby making the hedge less effective 
for example  a nymex index used for hedging certain volumes of production may have more or less variability than the regional price index used for the sale of that production 
the partnership s midstream business involves many hazards and operational risks  some of which may not be fully covered by insurance 
the partnership s midstream operations are subject to the many hazards inherent in the gathering  compression  treating  processing and transportation of natural gas and ngls  including damage to pipelines  related equipment and surrounding properties caused by hurricanes  tornadoes  floods  fires and other natural disasters and acts of terrorism  inadvertent damage from construction and farm equipment  leaks of natural gas  ngls and other hydrocarbons  and fires and explosions 
these risks could result in substantial losses due to personal injury or loss of life  severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment and pollution or other environmental damage and may result in curtailment or suspension of the partnership s related operations 
the partnership s midstream operations are concentrated in texas and oklahoma  and a natural disaster or other hazard affecting these areas could have a material adverse effect on its operations 
the partnership is not fully insured against all risks incident to its midstream business 
the partnership does not have property insurance on all of its underground pipeline systems that would cover damage to the pipelines 
the partnership is not insured against all environmental accidents that might occur  other than those considered to be sudden and accidental 
if a significant accident or event occurs that is not fully insured  it could adversely affect the partnership s operations and financial condition 
federal  state or local regulatory measures could adversely affect the partnership s midstream business 
cantera gas company cgc  a wholly owned subsidiary of pvr midstream llc  owns and operates an mile interstate natural gas pipeline which  pursuant to the nga  is subject to the jurisdiction of the ferc 
the ferc has granted cgc waivers of various requirements otherwise applicable to conventional ferc jurisdictional pipelines  including the obligation to file a tariff governing rates  terms and conditions of open access transportation service 
the ferc has determined that cgc will have to comply with the filing requirements if the natural gas company ever desires to apply for blanket transportation authority to transport third party gas on the mile pipeline 
we cannot assure you that the ferc will maintain these waivers 
the partnership s natural gas gathering facilities generally are exempt from the ferc s jurisdiction under the nga  but ferc regulation nevertheless could significantly affect its gathering business and the market for its services 
in recent years  the ferc has pursued pro competitive policies in its regulation of interstate natural gas pipelines into which the partnership s gathering pipelines deliver 
however  we cannot assure you that the ferc will continue this approach as it considers matters such as pipeline rates and rules and policies that may affect rights of access to natural gas transportation capacity 
in texas  the partnership s gathering facilities are subject to regulation by the texas railroad commission  which has the authority to ensure that rates  terms and conditions of gas utilities  including certain gathering facilities  are just and reasonable and not discriminatory 
the partnership s operations in oklahoma are regulated by the oklahoma corporation commission  which prohibits it from charging any unduly discriminatory fees for its gathering services 
we cannot predict whether the partnership s gathering rates will be found to be unjust  unreasonable or unduly discriminatory 
the partnership is subject to ratable take and common purchaser statutes in texas and oklahoma 
ratable take statutes generally require gatherers to take  without undue discrimination  natural gas production that may be tendered to the gatherer for handling 
similarly  common purchaser statutes generally require gatherers to purchase without undue discrimination as to source of supply or producer 
these statutes have the effect of restricting the partnership s right as an owner of gathering facilities to decide with whom it contracts to purchase or transport natural gas 
federal law leaves any economic regulation of natural gas gathering to the states  and texas and oklahoma have adopted complaint based regulation that generally allows natural gas producers and shippers to file complaints with state regulators in an effort to resolve grievances relating to natural gas gathering rates and access 
we cannot assure you that federal and state authorities will retain their current regulatory policies in the future 
texas and oklahoma administer federal pipeline safety standards under the ngpsa  which requires certain pipelines to comply with safety standards in constructing and operating the pipelines  and subjects pipelines to regular inspections 
in response to recent pipeline accidents  congress and the us department of transportation have recently instituted heightened pipeline safety requirements 
certain of the partnership s gathering facilities are exempt from these federal pipeline safety requirements under the rural gathering exemption 
we cannot assure you that the rural gathering exemption will be retained in its current form in the future 
failure to comply with applicable regulations under the nga  the ngpsa and certain state laws can result in the imposition of administrative  civil and criminal remedies 
the partnership s midstream business is subject to extensive environmental regulation 
many of the operations and activities of the partnership s gathering systems  plants and other facilities are subject to significant federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations 
these include  for example  laws and regulations that impose obligations related to air emissions and discharge of wastes from the partnership s facilities and the cleanup of hazardous substances that may have been released at properties currently or previously owned or operated by cantera or locations to which it has sent wastes for disposal 
these laws and regulations can restrict or impact the partnership s business activities in many ways  including restricting the manner in which it disposes of substances  requiring pre approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce air emissions  requiring remedial action to remove or mitigate contamination  and requiring capital expenditures to comply with control requirements 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative  civil and criminal enforcement measures  including the assessment of monetary penalties  the imposition of remedial requirements and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations 
certain environmental statutes impose strict  joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and restore sites where substances and wastes have been disposed or otherwise released 
moreover  it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of substances or wastes into the environment 
there is inherent risk of the incurrence of environmental costs and liabilities in the partnership s midstream business due to its handling of natural gas and other petroleum products  air emissions related to its midstream operations  historical industry operations  waste disposal practices and cantera s prior use of natural gas flow meters containing mercury 
for example  an accidental release from one of the partnership s pipelines or processing facilities could subject it to substantial liabilities arising from environmental cleanup  restoration costs and natural resource damages  claims made by neighboring landowners and other third parties for personal injury and property damage  and fines or penalties for related violations of environmental laws or regulations 
moreover  the possibility exists that stricter laws  regulations or enforcement policies could significantly increase the partnership s compliance costs and the cost of any remediation that may become necessary 
the partnership may incur material environmental costs and liabilities 
insurance may not provide sufficient coverage in the event an environmental claim is made 
item b unresolved staff comments we received no written comments from the sec staff regarding our periodic or current reports under the exchange act within days before the end of our fiscal year ended december  item properties facilities we are headquartered in radnor  pennsylvania  with additional offices in tennessee  texas and west virginia 
all of our office facilities are leased  except for pvr s west virginia office  which it owns 
we believe that our properties are adequate for our current needs 
title to properties the following map shows the general locations of our oil and gas production and exploration  pvr s coal reserves  pvr s coal services and infrastructure investments and pvr s natural gas gathering and processing systems message we believe that we have satisfactory title to all of our properties and the associated oil  gas and coal reserves in accordance with standards generally accepted in the oil and natural gas  coal and natural gas midstream industries 
as is customary in the oil and gas industry  we make only a cursory review of title to farmout acreage and to undeveloped oil and gas leases upon execution of any contracts 
prior to the commencement of drilling operations  a thorough title examination is conducted and curative work is performed with respect to significant defects 
to the extent title opinions or other investigations reflect defects  we cure such title defects 
if we were unable to remedy or cure any title defect of a nature such that it would not be prudent to commence drilling operations on a property  we could suffer a loss of our investment in the property 
prior to completing an acquisition of producing oil and gas assets  we obtain title opinions on all material leases 
our oil and gas properties are subject to customary royalty interests  liens for current taxes and other burdens that we believe do not materially interfere with the use or materially affect the value of such properties 
of the million tons of proven and probable coal reserves to which the partnership had rights as of december   pvr owned the mineral interests and the majority of related surface rights to million tons  or percent  and leased the remaining million tons  or percent  from unaffiliated third parties 
pvr s natural gas midstream assets are primarily located in the mid continent area of oklahoma and the panhandle of texas 
the partnership owns and operates a significant set of midstream assets that include approximately  miles of gas gathering pipelines and three natural gas processing facilities  which have mmcfd of total capacity 
pvr owns  leases or has rights of way to the properties where the majority of its midstream facilities are located 
pvr believes it has sufficient rights of way to accommodate its gathering systems and pipelines

for information on the changes in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with the sec s guidelines  the engineers estimates of future net revenues from our properties and the standardized measure thereof are based on oil and natural gas sales prices in effect as of december   and estimated future costs as of december  the prices are held constant throughout the life of the properties except where such guidelines permit alternate treatment  including the use of fixed and determinable contractual price escalations 
prices for oil and gas are subject to substantial seasonal fluctuations as well as fluctuations resulting from numerous other factors 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
proved reserves are the estimated quantities of natural gas  crude oil and condensate that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
proved developed reserves are proved reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures  including many factors beyond our control 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner  and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
the quantities of crude oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered  production and operating costs  the amount and timing of future development expenditures and future crude oil and natural gas sales prices may all differ from those assumed in these estimates 
therefore  the standardized measure amounts shown above should not be construed as the current market value of the estimated oil and natural gas reserves attributable to our properties 
the information set forth in the foregoing tables includes revisions of certain volumetric reserve estimates attributable to proved properties included in the preceding year s estimates 
such revisions are the result of additional information from subsequent completions and production history from the properties involved or the result of a decrease or increase in the projected economic life of such properties resulting from changes in production prices

information regarding coal properties at december   the partnership s coal reserves were located on approximately  acres  including fee and leased acreage  in kentucky  new mexico  virginia and west virginia 
the coal reserves are in various surface and underground seams 
as of december   the partnership had approximately million tons of proven and probable coal reserves  which are found in the following properties the central appalachia property  located in buchanan  lee and wise counties  virginia  floyd  harlan  knott and letcher counties  kentucky  and boone  fayette  kanawha  lincoln  logan and raleigh counties  west virginia  the northern appalachia property  located in barbour  harrison  lewis  monongalia and upshur counties  west virginia  the illinois basin property  located in henderson and webster counties  kentucky  and the san juan basin property  located in mckinley county  new mexico 
reserves are coal tons that can be economically extracted or produced at the time of determination considering legal  economic and technical limitations 
proven coal reserves are reserves for which a the quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops  trenches  workings or drill holes  b grade and or quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling  and c the sites for inspection  sampling and measurement are spaced so closely  and the geologic character is so well defined  that the size  shape  depth and mineral content of reserves are well established 
probable coal reserves are reserves for which quantity and grade and or quality are computed from information similar to that used for proven reserves  but the sites for inspection  sampling and measurement are more widely spaced or are otherwise less adequately spaced 
the degree of assurance  although lower than that for proven reserves  is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation 
in areas where geologic conditions indicate potential inconsistencies related to coal reserves  the partnership performs additional exploration to ensure the continuity and mineablility of coal reserves 
consequently  sampling in those areas involves drill holes or channel samples that are spaced closer together than those distances cited above 
reserve estimates are adjusted annually for production  unmineable areas  acquisitions and sales of coal in place 
the majority of pvr s reserves are high in energy content and low in sulfur 
the amount of coal that a lessee can profitably mine at any given time is subject to several factors and may be substantially different from proven and probable reserves 
included among the factors that influence profitability are the existing market price  coal quality and operating costs

these estimates are compiled using geological data taken from thousands of drill holes  geophysical logs  adjacent mine workings  outcrop prospect openings and other sources 
these estimates also take into account legal  qualitative  technical and economic limitations that may keep coal from being mined
