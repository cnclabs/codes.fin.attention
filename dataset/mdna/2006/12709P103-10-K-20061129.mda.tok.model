overview cabot microelectronics corporation cabot microelectronics  the company  us  we  or our is the leading supplier of high performance polishing slurries used in the manufacture of advanced integrated circuit ic devices within the semiconductor industry  in a process called chemical mechanical planarization cmp 
cmp is a process that polishes surfaces at an atomic level  thereby enabling ic device manufacturers to produce smaller  faster and more complex ic devices with fewer defects 
we believe that demand for our products is primarily based on the number of wafers  or wafer starts  of advanced devices produced by semiconductor manufacturers 
we operate predominantly in one industry segment the development  manufacture and sale of cmp slurries 
our cmp products are used for a number of applications  such as polishing insulating dielectric layers  tungsten that is used to connect the multiple wiring layers of ic devices through these insulating layers  and copper wiring  including the associated barrier film 
we also develop  manufacture and sell cmp slurries for polishing certain components in hard disk drives  specifically rigid disk substrates and magnetic heads  and we believe we are one of the leading suppliers in this area 
in addition  we are developing and commercializing cmp polishing pads  which are used in conjunction with slurries in the cmp process 
in addition to strengthening and growing our core cmp business  through our engineered surface finishes esf initiative we are exploring a variety of surface modification applications where we believe our technical ability to shape  enable and enhance the performance of surfaces at an atomic level may provide improved productivity or previously unseen surface performance 
by supplementing our internal development efforts with some externally acquired technologies and businesses  we seek to leverage our expertise in cmp slurry formulation  materials and polishing techniques for the semiconductor industry to address other demanding market applications requiring nanoscale control of surface shape and finish  and gain access to a variety of markets that we do not currently serve 

table of contents in pursuit of our esf initiative  we completed two acquisitions in fiscal in october  we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain current liabilities of surface finishes co  inc  a privately held company that specializes in precision machining techniques at the sub nanometer level  as well as associated real property from a related trust 
the total purchase price  was approximately million 
in july we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain current liabilities of qed technologies  inc qed  a privately held company that specializes in unique  patented polishing and metrology systems for shaping and polishing of high precision optics 
the purchase price was approximately million  which we paid in cash from our available balance and we may pay up to an additional million depending upon the performance of the qed business over the two years following the purchase 
on a geographic basis  the asia pacific region continues to be the fastest growing region for ic manufacturing as well as for our business  and we expect this trend to continue in the future 
in furtherance of our strategic initiatives to advance our technology leadership and to stay connected with our customers  we opened our asia pacific technology center  located adjacent to our existing manufacturing facility in geino  japan  which includes a clean room and provides polishing  metrology and product development capability to support our customers in the region 
in addition  we moved the portion of our business that serves the rigid disk market to singapore  since a number of important industry participants are located in southeast asia 
another example of our commitment to staying connected with customers is our transition to direct sales in taiwan 
in august we announced plans to sell our products directly to customers in taiwan  rather than through marketech  an independent distributor  effective april we executed this orderly transition in our second fiscal quarter of our distributor sold its remaining inventory of our products to our customers and we built inventory required to service these customers directly  this caused a short term adverse effect to our normal sales pattern of approximately million to million during our second fiscal quarter 
however  following the transition period  our sales volumes rebounded and our revenue increased slightly to the extent we were able to gain a portion of our distributor s markup 
this year  we added to our portfolio of intellectual property for cmp slurries by acquiring from international business machines corporation ibm a number of patents and associated rights relating to cmp slurry technology for million 
these patents and associated rights cover a wide range of cmp slurry applications  and we believe they represent a valuable complement to our existing technology and build on the overall strength of our intellectual property 
additionally  we were successful in an action we brought before the united states international trade commission itc concerning cheil industries  inc and its importation and sale within the united states of certain cmp slurries that infringe certain of our patents 
the itc s actions served to grant our request to prevent this competitor from  among other things  importing any infringing products into the us in october we announced that our board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program for up to million of our outstanding common stock 
shares were repurchased from time to time  depending on market conditions  in open market transactions  at management s discretion 
we intend to continue funding share repurchases from our existing cash balance 
we view the program as an effective means to return cash to shareholders 
the program  which became effective on the authorization date  may be suspended or terminated at any time  at the company s discretion 
in fiscal we repurchased  shares of stock for a total price of million  leaving million remaining under the program at the beginning of fiscal revenue for fiscal was million  which was an increase of from the million reported for fiscal  due largely to an increase in sales volume 
this increase in revenue reflects a modest semiconductor industry recovery in following a downturn in our long term goal is to grow our revenue by per year  which would allow us to achieve annual revenue of approximately million in three years 
however  there are many factors that make it difficult for us to predict future revenue trends for our business  including the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry  timing of our potential future acquisitions  short order to delivery time for our products and the associated lack of visibility to future customer orders  and quarter to quarter changes in our revenue regardless of industry strength 

table of contents gross profit expressed as a percentage of revenue for fiscal was  which represents a decrease from the reported for fiscal the decrease was primarily driven by selected price reductions and higher costs including those associated with commercializing our pad product line and the transition of our data storage business to singapore 
these adverse effects were partially offset by higher utilization of our manufacturing capacity due to the higher level of sales 
we expect to be able to maintain our gross profit as a percentage of revenue in the range of to for fiscal year this guidance applies to our full fiscal year results rather than specific quarterly results  we may experience quarterly gross profit above or below this range due to fluctuations in our product mix or other factors 
operating expenses  which include research  development  technical  selling  marketing  general and administrative expenses  increased  or million  from the million reported for fiscal one of the primary reasons for this increase is the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r effective october share based compensation expense is now recognized in our income statement rather than just disclosed in our footnotes  which was previously allowed 
pre tax share based compensation expense for fiscal was million  of which million was classified in operating expenses 
another reason for the increase in operating expenses was higher staffing costs  including costs to support our initiatives in the asia pacific region 
operating expenses also increased due to our acquisitions described above  including for the expensing of purchased in process research and development ipr d associated with our qed acquisition 
in fiscal  we expect our operating expenses to be in the range of approximately million to million per quarter  trending up slightly within this range during the year 
critical accounting policies and estimates this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as disclosures included elsewhere in this form k  are based upon our audited consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingencies 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate the estimates used  including those related to bad debt expense  warranty obligations  inventory valuation  impairment of long lived assets and investments  business combinations  goodwill  other intangible assets  share based compensation  income taxes and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience  current conditions and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources  as well as identifying and assessing our accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies involve significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the potential inability of our customers to make required payments 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is based on historical collection experience  adjusted for any specific known conditions or circumstances 
while historical experience may provide a reasonable estimate of uncollectible accounts  actual results may differ from what was recorded 
as of september   our allowance for doubtful accounts represented of gross accounts receivable 
if we had increased our estimate of bad debts by  to of gross accounts receivable  our general and administrative expense would have increased by million 

table of contents warranty reserve we maintain a warranty reserve that reflects management s best estimate of the cost to replace product that does not meet customers specifications and performance requirements  and costs related to such replacement 
the warranty reserve is based upon a historical product replacement rate  adjusted for any specific known conditions or circumstances 
should actual warranty costs differ substantially from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability may be required 
as of september   our warranty reserve represented of the current quarter revenue 
if we had increased our warranty reserve estimate by  to of the current quarter revenue  our cost of goods sold would have increased by million 
inventory valuation we value inventory at the lower of cost or market and write down the value of inventory for estimated obsolescence or if inventory is deemed unmarketable 
an inventory reserve is maintained based upon a historical percentage of actual inventory written off applied against inventory at the end of the period  adjusted for known conditions and circumstances 
we exercise judgment in estimating the amount of inventory that is obsolete 
should actual product marketability and raw material fitness for use be affected by conditions that are different from those projected by management  revisions to the estimated inventory reserve may be required 
impairment of long lived assets and investments sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  requires us to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired 
we must exercise judgment in assessing whether an event of impairment has occurred 
for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss  long lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
we must exercise judgment in this grouping 
sfas requires that if the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the identified asset group is less than the carrying value of the asset group  then an impairment must be recognized in the financial statements 
the amount of the impairment to be recognized is calculated by subtracting the fair value of the asset group from the reported value of the asset group 
determining future cash flows and estimating fair values requires significant judgments and is highly susceptible to change from period to period because it requires management to make assumptions about future sales and cost of sales generally over a long term period 
we evaluate the estimated fair value of investments annually or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist  to determine if an other than temporary impairment in the value of the investment has taken place 
business combinations in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations  we allocate the purchase price of acquired entities to the tangible and intangible assets acquired  liabilities assumed  as well as ipr d based on their estimated fair values 
we engage independent third party appraisal firms to assist us in determining the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired 
this valuation requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to long lived and intangible assets 
critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows related to acquired developed technologies and patents and assumptions about the period of time the technologies will continue to be used in the combined company s product portfolio  expected costs to develop the ipr d into commercially viable products and estimating cash flows from the projects when completed  and discount rates 
management s estimates of value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur 

table of contents goodwill and other intangible assets purchased intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
goodwill and other intangible assets are tested annually or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist  using a fair value based approach 
we determined that goodwill and other intangible assets were not impaired as of september  share based compensation effective october   we adopted sfas r  which requires all share based payments  including stock option grants  restricted stock and employee stock purchases  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
sfas r supersedes our previous accounting for share based compensation under accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  as allowed under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas and sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas 
under sfas r  the pro forma disclosure alternative permitted under sfas and sfas is no longer allowable 
we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective transition method as permitted by sfas r  therefore  we have not restated our financial results for prior periods 
under sfas r  we continue to attribute share based compensation expense using the straight line approach based on awards ultimately expected to vest  which requires the use of an estimated forfeiture rate 
forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience 
in addition  we continue to use the black scholes option pricing model black scholes model to estimate grant date fair value  which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the option s expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock 
a small change in the underlying assumptions can have a relatively large effect on the estimated valuation 
under sfas r  we estimate expected volatility based on a combination of our stock s historical volatility and the implied volatilities from actively traded options on our stock 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we estimated expected volatility based only on our stock s historical volatility in accordance with sfas for purposes of our pro forma disclosure 
we believe that implied volatility is more reflective of market conditions  however  due to the shorter length in term of the actively traded options  we believe it to be appropriate to use a blended assumption 
in addition  we have updated our expected term assumption by adopting the simplified method as defined under staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 share based payments sab  due to our limited amount of historical option exercise data 
this method uses an average of the vesting and contractual terms 
through an amendment made and effective as of september   the vesting of approximately million options  that had option prices greater than on the amendment date  was accelerated to september  the acceleration enabled us to eliminate the recognition of share based compensation expense associated with these out of the money options in our consolidated financial statements upon the adoption of sfas r in october because expected share based compensation expense for fiscal would have been higher if the vesting of these out of the money stock options had not been accelerated  it may not be representative of share based compensation expense for future years 
in addition  factors that may impact share based compensation expense in future years include  but are not limited to  changes to our historical approaches to long term incentives  such as the timing and number of additional grants of stock option awards  the vesting period and contractual term of stock option awards and types of equity awards granted 
further  share based compensation may be impacted by changes in the fair value of future awards through variables such as fluctuations in and volatility of our stock price  as well as changes in employee exercise behavior and forfeiture rates 
as of september   there was million of total unrecognized share based compensation expense related to nonvested stock options granted under the plan 
that cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
our historical approach to long term incentives has been primarily through the issuance of stock options 
however  beginning in fiscal  we anticipate moving to a blend of equity grants  under which a combination of stock option awards and restricted stock or restricted stock units are anticipated being granted 
we anticipate that both the stock options and the restricted stock or restricted stock units will vest equally over a four year period  with first vesting on the anniversary of the grant date  and with stock options continuing to have a ten year contractual term 

table of contents accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we have determined that it is more likely than not that our future taxable income will be sufficient to realize our deferred tax assets 
commitments and contingencies we have entered into unconditional purchase obligations  which include noncancelable purchase commitments and take or pay arrangements with suppliers 
we review our agreements and make an assessment of the likelihood of a shortfall in purchases and determine if it is necessary to record a liability 
in addition  we are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business such as a legal proceeding or claim 
an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required 
effects of recent accounting pronouncements in september  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement 
the sec staff believes that registrants should quantify errors using both a balance sheet and an income statement approach and evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying a misstatement that  when all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are considered  is material 
sab is effective for fiscal years ending after november  we do not expect the adoption of sab to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurement sfas 
sfas establishes a common definition for fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure about such fair value measurements

in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r sfas 
sfas requires an employer that sponsors one or more single employer defined benefit plans to a recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a benefit plan in its statement of financial position  b recognize as a component of other comprehensive income  net of tax  any remaining unamortized transition obligation upon adoption as well as the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that have not yet been recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost pursuant to sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  or sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  c measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the date of the employer s fiscal year end  and d disclose in the notes to financial statements additional information about certain effects on net periodic benefit cost for the next fiscal year that arise from delayed recognition of the gains or losses  prior service costs or credits and transition asset or obligation 
this statement is effective for fiscal years ending after december  we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting sfas on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 

table of contents in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement fin  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions 
this interpretation sets forth a recognition threshold and measurement element for the recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
this interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting fin on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in june  the fasb ratified the consensus reached by the emerging issues task force eitf in issue no 
 how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation eitf 
the scope of this issue includes any tax assessed by a governmental authority that is directly imposed on a revenue producing activity between a seller and a customer and may include  but is not limited to  sales  use  value added  and some excise taxes 
eitf indicates that the income statement presentation of these taxes on a gross or net basis is an accounting policy decision that should be disclosed in a company s financial statements 
eitf is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of eitf to have an impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in november  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp nos 
fas and fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments fsp fas and 
this fsp addresses the determination as to when an investment is considered impaired  whether that impairment is other than temporary  and the measurement of an impairment loss 
it also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of other than temporary impairments 
the fsp applies to reporting periods beginning after december  the adoption of fsp fas and did not impact our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in september  the fasb issued eitf issue no

 accounting for nonmonetary transactions  when the transactions are entered into in contemplation of one another 
furthermore  when two transactions are considered a single arrangement  the assets exchanged should be accounted for at fair value 
the eitf is effective for transactions completed in reporting periods beginning after march  the adoption of eitf did not impact our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of revenue of certain line items included in our historical statements of income year ended september  revenue cost of goods sold gross profit research  development and technical selling and marketing general and administrative purchased in process research and development operating income other income  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income year ended september   versus year ended september  revenue revenue was million in  which represented an  or million  increase from of this increase  million was due to an increase in sales volume and million was related to our july acquisition of qed  these increases were partially offset by a net million decrease due to the change in weighted average selling price 
the decrease in weighted average selling price primarily resulted from selected price reductions largely offset by a higher priced product mix 
selling prices are also affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
revenue for fiscal would have been million higher had the average exchange rates for the japanese yen and euro during the year held constant with the prior year s average rates 
revenue increased in fiscal despite our transition to selling directly to our customers in taiwan rather than through a distributor  which caused a short term interruption in our normal sales pattern during our second quarter of fiscal of approximately million to million 
however  after this transition period  we believe we were able to gain a portion of the markup that our distributor previously charged its end customers  which partially offset the adverse revenue impact from the transition 
our long term goal is to grow our revenue by per year  which would allow us to achieve annual revenue of approximately million in three years 
however  there are several factors that make it difficult for us to predict future revenue trends  as discussed in the overview section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents cost of goods sold total cost of goods sold was million in  which represented an increase of  or million  from of this increase  million was due to higher sales volume  million was related to our acquisition of qed and million was due to higher average costs per gallon 
the average cost per gallon increased primarily due to a higher cost product mix  higher fixed costs  including amortization of our cmp technology patents from ibm  and greater logistics costs as a result of our transition to direct sales in taiwan 
these costs were partially offset by higher utilization of our manufacturing capacity due to the higher level of sales 
fumed metal oxides  such as fumed silica and fumed alumina  are significant raw materials that we use in many of our cmp slurries 
in an effort to mitigate our risk to rising raw material costs and to increase supply assurance and quality performance requirements  we have entered into multi year supply agreements with a number of suppliers 
for more financial information about our supply contracts  see tabular disclosure of contractual obligations included in item of part ii of this form k 
our need for additional quantities or different kinds of key raw materials in the future has required  and will continue to require  that we enter into new supply arrangements with third parties 
future arrangements may result in costs which are different from those in the existing agreements 
in addition  rising energy costs may also impact the cost of raw materials  packaging and freight costs 
we also expect to continue to invest in our operations excellence initiative to improve product quality  reduce variability and improve product yields in our manufacturing process 
gross profit our gross profit as a percentage of revenue was in as compared to in the percentage point decrease in gross profit margin resulted primarily from selected price reductions and higher costs including those associated with commercializing our pad product line and the transition of our data storage business to singapore 
these adverse effects were partially offset by higher utilization of our manufacturing capacity due to the higher level of sales 
we expect to be able to maintain our gross profit as a percentage of revenue in the range of to for full fiscal year quarterly gross profit may be above or below this range due to fluctuations in our product mix or other factors 
research  development and technical total research  development and technical expenses were million in  which represented an increase of or million  from the increase was primarily related to million in increased staffing costs  million in increased depreciation and million in impairment expense 
the increased staffing costs included million in higher expenses for our annual incentive program related to our research  development and technical staff as well as million in share based compensation expense 
the increased depreciation expense was primarily related to the october opening of our asia pacific technology center in geino  japan 
the impairment expense was attributable to the decision to no longer use the portion of a building in aurora  illinois  that was previously used for research and development activities 
these increases were partially offset by million in decreased costs for clean room materials and laboratory supplies 
our research  development and technical efforts are focused on the following main areas research related to fundamental cmp technology  development and formulation of new and enhanced cmp slurry and pad products  process development to support rapid and effective commercialization of new products  evaluation of new polishing applications outside of the semiconductor industry  and applications support 

table of contents selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses were million in  which represented an increase of  or million  over the increase resulted primarily from higher staffing costs of million  including million in share based compensation expense and million in higher expense for our annual incentive program related to our sales and marketing staff 
another million of the increase was due to increased travel to the asia pacific region as we implemented a number of projects in support of our strategic initiative to stay connected with our customers  such as transitioning to direct sales in taiwan and moving our data storage business to singapore 
selling and marketing expenses also increased million due to higher office rental fees and million related to increased product sample costs 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses were million in  which represented an increase of  or million  from the increase resulted primarily from million in higher staffing costs  including million in share based compensation expense and million in higher expense for our annual incentive program 
purchased in process research and development purchased ipr d expense was million in  resulting from the acquisition of substantially all of the assets and assumption of certain liabilities of qed 
we may make future acquisitions and may record additional expenses for ipr d in connection with those acquisitions 
other income  net other income was million in  compared to million in the increase in other income was primarily due to million greater interest income from higher interest rates and our larger average balance of cash and short term investments  partially offset by million of expense associated with our investment in nanoproducts corporation 
provision for income taxes our effective income tax rate was in and in the increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to reduced research and experimentation tax credits due to the expiration of the credit effective december  in addition  we recognized reduced extraterritorial income tax deductions related to export sales of our products from north america due to the phase out of this tax benefit 
we expect our effective tax rate in fiscal to be between and percent 
net income net income was million in  which represented an increase of  or million  from as a result of the factors discussed above 

table of contents year ended september   versus year ended september  revenue revenue was million in  which represented a  or million  decrease from of this decrease  million was due to a decrease in sales volume and million was due to a decrease in weighted average selling price  primarily resulting from selected price reductions partially offset by a higher valued product mix 
revenue for fiscal would have been million lower had the average exchange rates for the japanese yen and euro during the period held constant with the prior year s average rates 
following a period of strong semiconductor demand in the second half of fiscal  our revenue during the first three quarters of fiscal was adversely impacted in part by a downturn in the semiconductor industry  which we believe was partially driven by a reduction in wafer starts by some semiconductor manufacturers to reduce excess inventories of certain semiconductor devices 
another factor that adversely affected our fiscal revenue was the remaining impact of one large customer transitioning to another supplier of cmp slurry for polishing copper interconnects at nanometer technology 
cost of goods sold total cost of goods sold was million in  which represented a decrease of  or million  from of this decrease  million was due to lower sales volume and million was due to lower average costs per gallon  primarily due to improved manufacturing yields partially offset by higher fixed costs 
gross profit our gross profit as a percentage of revenue was in as compared to in the percentage point decrease in gross profit margin resulted primarily from selected price reductions and lower utilization of our manufacturing capacity due to the lower level of sales  partially offset by a higher valued product mix 
research  development and technical total research  development and technical expenses were million in  which represented a decrease of or million  from the decrease is primarily related to million in lower expenses for clean room materials and laboratory supplies  million in lower technical service and analysis fees and million in lower facilities costs 
these decreases were partially offset by million in higher depreciation expense related to equipment purchased in for our cmp polishing and metrology clean room in aurora  illinois  and million in higher staffing costs 
selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses were million in  which represented an increase of  or million  over the increase resulted primarily from higher staffing costs of million and higher facility costs of million 
these increases were partially offset by decreased consulting fees of million and lower product sample costs of million 

table of contents general and administrative general and administrative expenses were million in  which represented an increase of  or million  from the increase resulted primarily from million in higher staffing costs and million of increased professional fees primarily related to meeting the requirements of sarbanes oxley section other income  net other income was million in  compared to million in the increase in other income was primarily due to million greater interest income from higher interest rates and our larger average balance of cash and short term investments  as well as a million increase in foreign exchange gains 
provision for income taxes our effective income tax rate was in and in the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to higher tax exempt interest income and the increased effect of extraterritorial income tax credits related to export sales from north america 
net income net income was million in  which represented a decrease of  or million  from as a result of the factors discussed above 
liquidity and capital resources we had cash flows from operating activities of million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal our cash provided by operating activities in fiscal originated from net income from operations of million and noncash items of million  which were partially offset by a net increase in working capital of million 
in fiscal cash flows used in investing activities were million 
purchases of property  plant and equipment  primarily for the construction of our asia pacific technology center and for projects in our manufacturing operations  were made with million in cash and million in accrued liabilities and accounts payable 
we also completed two acquisitions during the fiscal year for a total of million  net of cash acquired 
in addition  we used million to acquire patents and associated rights relating to cmp slurry technology 
finally  million was provided by net sales of short term auction rate securities 
fiscal cash flows used in investing activities were million 
purchases of property  plant and equipment  primarily for the construction of our asia pacific technology center and other manufacturing projects  were made with million in cash and million in accrued liabilities 
in addition  million was used for net purchases of short term auction rate securities in fiscal and million was used for the final payment for our acquisition of a minority ownership interest in nanoproducts corporation 
in fiscal cash flows used in investing activities were million  of which million was used for net purchases of auction rate securities 
also in that year  million was used for purchases of property  plant and equipment  including purchases of land in geino  japan  manufacturing equipment and research and development equipment 
finally  we invested million as partial payment for a minority ownership interest in nanoproducts corporation in fiscal we estimate that our total capital expenditures in fiscal will be approximately million  however  we are exploring options for providing cmp slurry manufacturing capability in taiwan  and depending on how we fulfill this initiative  our capital spending could be much higher 

table of contents in fiscal cash flows used in financing activities were million  primarily as a result of million in repurchases of common stock under our share repurchase program and million in principal payments under capital lease obligations 
these outflows were partially offset by the issuance of common stock of million primarily from purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 
in fiscal cash flows used in financing activities were million  primarily as a result of million in repurchases of common stock under our share repurchase program and million in principal payments under capital lease obligations 
these outflows were partially offset by the issuance of common stock of million from the exercise of stock options under our equity incentive plan and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 
in fiscal cash flows used in financing activities of million were largely a result of repurchasing million of common stock under our share repurchase program and paying million in principal payments under capital lease obligations 
these outflows were partially offset by the issuance of common stock of million from the exercise of stock options under our equity incentive plan and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we completed our initial million share repurchase program  which was authorized in july in october  our board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program for up to million of our outstanding common stock 
shares are repurchased from time to time  depending on market conditions  in open market transactions  at management s discretion 
we fund share repurchases from our existing cash balance 
we view the program as an effective means to return cash to stockholders 
the program became effective on the authorization date and may be suspended or terminated at any time  at the company s discretion 
we have an unsecured revolving credit facility of million with an option to increase the facility up to million 
this agreement runs through november interest accrues on any outstanding balance at either the institution s base rate or the eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin 
we also pay a non use fee 
loans under this facility are anticipated to be used primarily for general corporate purposes  including working capital and capital expenditures 
the credit agreement also contains various covenants 
no amounts are currently outstanding under this credit facility and we believe we are currently in compliance with the covenants 
we believe that cash generated by our operations and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operations  expected capital expenditures  including merger and acquisition activities  and share repurchases for the foreseeable future 
however  we plan to expand our business and continue to improve our technology  and to do so may require us to raise additional funds in the future through public or private equity or debt financing  strategic relationships or other arrangements 
off balance sheet arrangements at september  and  we did not have any unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  which might have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk effect of currency exchange rates and exchange rate risk management we conduct business operations outside of the united states through our foreign operations 
some of our foreign operations maintain their accounting records in their local currencies 
consequently  period to period comparability of results of operations is affected by fluctuations in exchange rates 
the primary currencies to which we have exposure are the japanese yen and  to a lesser extent  the british pound and the euro 
from time to time we enter into forward contracts in an effort to manage foreign currency exchange exposure 
however  we may be unable to hedge these exposures completely 
approximately of our revenue is transacted in currencies other than the us dollar 
we do not currently enter into forward exchange contracts or other derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
market risk and sensitivity analysis related to foreign exchange rate risk we have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical adverse movement in foreign exchange rates 
as of september   the analysis demonstrated that such market movements would not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows over a one year period 
actual gains and losses in the future may differ materially from this analysis based on changes in the timing and amount of foreign currency rate movements and our actual exposures
