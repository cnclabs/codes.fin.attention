sales by group in millions increase decrease automated systems technology components value added services totals sales by location in millions increase decrease north america europe asia totals the higher level of sales in north america was primarily due to increased sales of the automated systems product group and primarily reflected the number of new vehicle programs and associated tooling requirements of customers in this region 
the sales decrease in europe was impacted by a generally declining euro that based on conversion rates in effect during fiscal  generated sales that were approximately million less than the comparable rates in fiscal would have yielded 
weak economic conditions in europe also caused customers to delay capital appropriation decisions that resulted in sales for the company s european subsidiary to decline slightly compared to one year ago 
the company believes that the decline in sales of value added services was a function of customer requirements and did not represent a trend of lower sales for this product group

outlook based on the backlog as of june  and new vehicle tooling programs being considered by customers in the company s north american and european automotive markets  the company expects new orders and sales for its core automated systems products in its existing markets in fiscal to be comparable to fiscal sales of automated systems products in north america  which were very good in fiscal  are expected to be lower in fiscal while sales of automated systems products in europe are expected to strengthen in fiscal compared with fiscal and offset the expected sales decline in north america 
the company s sales forecast is based on an assessment of the probable size  system content  and timing of each of the programs being considered by its customers 
these factors are difficult to quantify accurately because over time the company s customers weigh changes in the economy and the probable effect of these changes on their business  and adjust the number and timing of their new vehicle programs to reflect the changing business conditions 
the company continues to view the automotive industry s focus on introducing new vehicles more frequently to satisfy their customers changing requirements  as well as their continuing focus on improved quality  as positive indicators for new business 
the company expects to achieve sales growth above its base business in north america and europe during fiscal due to higher sales of its autoscan r system that began to gain customer acceptance during fiscal and the latest generation of its scanworks r product that was well received by its customer base 
the company also expects to achieve higher sales in asia related to its investments  largely in personnel  and the initial success of several automated systems that were sold in this region during fiscal the company expects to realize sales of its new electronic inspection products in fiscal the company has plans to add personnel  primarily in asia  and to a lesser extent in north america  to support its growth plans in asia and the introduction of its new product line outside of the automotive market 
as a result of the foregoing  the company expects both sales and net income levels for fiscal to be higher than those of fiscal  although the magnitude of the increase is difficult to project at this time

the cash provided from net working capital resulted primarily from a million reduction in net receivables due to more timely payments by customers mitigated by the use of cash of  for inventory required to fill customer orders   for accounts payable and  for current assets and liabilities 
the  use of cash for other current assets and liabilities primarily represents reductions of  in deferred revenues as a result of customer buy offs and  in accrued liabilities  offset by increased accruals for accrued payroll of  and reduced prepaid expenses of the company provides a reserve for obsolescence to recognize the effects of engineering change orders and other matters that affect the value of the inventory 
a detailed review of the inventory is performed yearly with quarterly updates for known changes that have occurred since the annual review

critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s financial statements and accompanying notes  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap 
the company s significant accounting policies are discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies 
certain of the company s significant accounting policies are subject to judgments and uncertainties  which affect the application of these policies and require the company to make estimates based on assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates and underlying assumptions 
in the event estimates or underlying assumptions prove to be different from actual amounts  adjustments are made in the subsequent period to reflect more current information 
the company believes that the following significant accounting policies involve management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments or involve the greatest uncertainty 
revenue recognition 
revenue related to products is recognized upon shipment when title and risk of loss has passed to the customer  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the sales price is fixed or determinable  collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured and customer acceptance criteria have been successfully demonstrated 
the company also has multiple element arrangements that may include purchase of equipment  labor support and or training 
each element has value on a stand alone basis 
for multiple element arrangements  the company defers from revenue recognition the greater of the fair value of any undelivered elements of the contract or the portion of the sales price of the contract that is not payable until the undelivered elements are completed 
delivered items are not contingent upon the delivery of any undelivered items nor do the delivered items include general rights of return 
the company does not have price protection agreements or requirements to buy back inventory 
the company s systems are made to order systems that are designed and configured to meet each customer s specific requirements 
as a result  the company has virtually no history of returns 
stock based compensation 
the company accounts for non cash stock based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r  share based payment 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating the amount of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
the estimated forfeiture rate may change from time to time based upon the company s actual experience 
an increase in the forfeiture rate would require the company to reverse a portion of its prior expense for non cash stock based compensation  which would positively impact the company s results of operations 
because the company currently experiences a low forfeiture rate  a reduction in the estimated forfeiture rate would not have a material impact on the company s results of operations 
accounts receivable 
the company monitors its accounts receivable and charges to expense an amount equal to its estimate of potential credit losses 
the company considers a number of factors in determining its estimates  including  the length of time trade accounts receivable are past due  the company s previous loss history  the customer s current ability to pay its obligation and the condition of the general economy and the industry as a whole 
the use of different estimates for future credit losses would result in different charges to selling  general and administrative expense in each period presented and could negatively affect the company s results of operations for the period 
in addition  if actual experience differs materially from the company s estimates  such as was the case in fiscal year  described in selling  general and administrative sg a expenses with the unexpected bankruptcy of a large customer  the company could be required to record large credit losses that could negatively affect the company s results of operations for the period 
inventories 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined under the first in  first out method 
provision is made to reduce inventories to net realizable value for excess and or obsolete inventory 
the company periodically reviews its inventory levels in order to identify obsolete and slow moving inventory 
the company estimates excess or obsolete inventory based principally upon contemplated future customer demand for the company s products and the timing of product upgrades 
the use of different assumptions in determining slow moving and obsolete inventories would result in different charges to cost of sales in each period presented and could negatively affect the company s results of operations for the period 
in addition  if actual experience differs materially from the company s estimates  such as was the case in fiscal  described in gross profit  the company could be required to record large losses that could negatively affect the company s results of operations for the period 
deferred income taxes 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities represent the future income tax effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of the company s assets and liabilities  assuming they will be realized and settled at the amounts reported in the company s financial statements 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized 
this assessment includes consideration for the scheduled reversal of temporary taxable differences  projected future taxable income and the impact of tax planning 
the company adjusts this valuation allowance periodically based upon changes in these considerations 
in fiscal the company reduced the valuation allowance  described in income taxes and note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  income taxes  based on the past few years of taxable income and projected future taxable income 
if actual long term future taxable income is lower than the company s estimate  the company may be required to record material adjustments to the deferred tax assets  resulting in a charge to income in the period of determination and negatively impacting the company s results of operations and financial position for the period 
litigation and other contingencies 
the company is subject to various legal proceedings and other contingencies  the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty 
the company accrues for estimated losses if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
the company uses judgment and evaluates  with the assistance of legal counsel  whether a loss contingency arising from litigation should be disclosed or recorded 
the outcome of legal proceedings is inherently uncertain and so typically a loss cannot be reasonably estimated 
accordingly  if the outcome of legal proceedings are different than is anticipated by the company  the company would have to record a charge for the matter  generally in the full amount at which it was resolved  in the period resolved  negatively impacting the company s results of operations and financial position for the period 
market risk information perceptron s primary market risk is related to foreign exchange rates 
the foreign exchange risk is derived from the operations of its international subsidiaries  which are primarily located in germany and for which products are produced in the us the company may from time to time have interest rate risk in connection with its borrowings 
foreign currency risk the company has foreign currency exchange risk in its international operations arising from the time period between sales commitment and delivery for contracts in non us currencies 
for sales commitments entered into in the non united states currencies  the currency rate risk exposure is predominantly less than one year with the majority in the to day range 
at june   the company s percentage of sales commitments in non united states currencies was approximately or million  compared to or million at june the company may use  from time to time  a limited hedging program to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
these transactions involve the use of forward contracts  typically mature within one year and are designed to hedge anticipated foreign currency transactions 
the company may use forward exchange contracts to hedge the net assets of certain of its foreign subsidiaries to offset the translation and economic exposures related to the company s investment in these subsidiaries 
at june   the company had forward exchange contracts to sell million euros million equivalent at a weighted average settlement rate of euros to the united states dollar 
the contracts outstanding at june   mature through january  the objective of the hedge transactions is to protect designated portions of the company s net investment in its foreign subsidiary against adverse changes in the euro us dollar exchange rate 
the company assesses hedge effectiveness based on overall changes in fair value of the forward contract 
since the critical risks of the forward contract and the net investment coincide  there was no ineffectiveness 
the accounting for the hedges is consistent with translation adjustments where any gains and losses are recorded to other comprehensive income 
the company recognized a loss of  in other comprehensive income loss for the unrealized and realized change in value of the forward exchange contracts during the fiscal year ended june  offsetting this amount in other comprehensive income loss was the translation effect of the company s foreign subsidiary 
because the forward contracts were effective  there was no gain or loss recognized in earnings 
the company s forward exchange contracts do not subject it to material risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these contracts offset losses and gains on the assets  liabilities  and transactions being hedged 
for fiscal years ended june  and  the company had approximately million and million  respectively  of forward exchange contracts between the united states dollar and the euro with weighted average settlement prices of and euro to each united states dollar  respectively 
the company recognized income of approximately  and a charge of approximately  in other comprehensive income loss for the unrealized and realized change in value of forward exchange contracts during the fiscal years ended june  and june   respectively 
the company s potential loss in earnings that would have resulted from a hypothetical adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates related to the translation of foreign denominated revenues and expenses into us dollars for the fiscal years ended june   and  would have been approximately   and  respectively 
interest rate risk the company invests its cash and cash equivalents in high quality  short term investments with primarily a term of three months or less 
given the short maturities and investment grade quality of the company s investment holdings at june   a basis point rise in interest rates would not be expected to have a material adverse impact on the fair value of the company s cash and cash equivalents 
as a result  the company does not currently hedge these interest rate exposures

the company s expectations regarding future bookings and revenues are projections developed by the company based upon information from a number of sources  including  but not limited to  customer data and discussions 
these projections are subject to change based upon a wide variety of factors  a number of which are discussed above 
certain of these new orders have been delayed in the past and could be delayed in the future 
because the company s products are typically integrated into larger systems or lines  the timing of new orders is dependent on the timing of completion of the overall system or line 
in addition  because the company s products have shorter lead times than other components and are required later in the process  orders for the company s products tend to be given later in the integration process 
a significant portion of the company s projected revenues and net income depends upon the company s ability to successfully develop and introduce new products and expand into new geographic markets 
because a significant portion of the company s revenues are denominated in foreign currencies and are translated for financial reporting purposes into us dollars  the level of the company s reported net sales  operating profits and net income are affected by changes in currency exchange rates  principally between us dollars and euros 
currency exchange rates are subject to significant fluctuations  due to a number of factors beyond the control of the company  including general economic conditions in the united states and other countries 
because the company s expectations regarding future revenues  order bookings  backlog and operating results are based upon assumptions as to the levels of such currency exchange rates  actual results could differ materially from the company s expectations
