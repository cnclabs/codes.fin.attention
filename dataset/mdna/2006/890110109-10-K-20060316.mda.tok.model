competition competition for commercial banking and other financial services is strong in the company s market areas 
the deregulation of the banking industry and the widespread enactment of state laws that permit multi bank holding companies  as well as an increasing level of interstate banking  have created a highly competitive environment for commercial banking 
in one or more aspects of its business  the company s subsidiaries compete with other commercial banks  savings and loan associations  credit unions  finance companies  mutual funds  insurance companies  brokerage and investment banking companies  and other financial intermediaries 
some of these competitors have substantially greater resources and lending capabilities and may offer services that the company does not currently provide 
in addition  many of the company s non bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive federal regulations that govern financial holding companies and federally insured banks 
competition among financial institutions is based upon interest rates offered on deposit accounts  interest rates charged on loans and other credit and service charges  the quality and scope of the services rendered  the convenience of banking facilities and  in the case of loans to commercial borrowers  relative lending limits 
management believes that a community bank is better positioned to establish personalized banking relationships with both commercial customers and individual households 
the company s community commitment and involvement in its primary market areas  as well as its commitment to quality and personalized banking services  are factors that contribute to the company s competitiveness 
management believes that each of the company s subsidiary banks can compete successfully in its primary market areas by making prudent lending decisions quickly and more efficiently than its competitors  without compromising asset quality or profitability  although no assurances can be given that such factors will assure success

a comparison of the company s capital ratios and the various regulatory requirements is included in note regulations and supervision in notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report on form k 
deposit insurance all deposit accounts of the company s subsidiary banks are insured by the bank insurance fund bif  generally in amounts up to  per depositor 
deposit insurance coverage is maintained by payment of premiums assessed to banks insured by the bif 
the fdic uses a risk based assessment system that determines insurance premiums based upon a bank s capital level and supervisory rating 
based on capital strength and favorable fdic risk classifications  the company s subsidiary banks are not currently subject to bif insurance assessments 
since january  all bif insured banks have been subject to special assessments to repay financing corporation fico bonds  which were used to repay depositors of failed savings and loan associations after the former federal savings and loan insurance fund became insolvent 
depositor preference the federal deposit insurance act provides that  in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository  the claims of depositors of the institution  including the claims of the fdic  as subrogee of the insured depositors  and certain claims for administrative expenses of the fdic as receiver  will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution

item a 
risk factors the company s business  operating results  financial condition  liquidity  and cash flow may be impacted by numerous factors  including but not limited to those discussed below 
these items may cause the company s results to vary materially from recent results 
interest rate risk the company s earnings  financial condition and liquidity are susceptible to fluctuations in market interest rates 
net interest income  which is the difference between interest earned on loans and investments and interest paid on deposits and borrowings  is the largest component of the company s total revenues 
the level of net interest income is dependent upon the volume and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the level of nonperforming assets  and the level and trend of interest rates 
changes in market interest rates will also affect the level of prepayments on the company s loans and payments on mortgage backed securities  resulting in the receipt of proceeds that may be reinvested at a lower rate than the loan or mortgage backed security being prepaid 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including inflation  economic growth  employment levels  monetary policy and international markets 
significant fluctuations in interest rates could have a material adverse affect on the company s earnings  financial condition  and liquidity 
the company manages interest rate risk using income simulation to measure interest rate risk inherent in its on balance sheet and off balance sheet financial instruments at a given point in time by showing the potential effect of interest rate shifts on net interest income for future periods 
each quarter the company s asset liability management committee reviews the simulation results to determine whether the exposure of net interest income to changes in interest rates remains within board approved levels 
the committee also discusses strategies to manage this exposure and incorporates these strategies into the investment and funding decisions of the company 
in addition  the company has focused on expanding its fee based business as a percentage of revenues to help mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
for additional information about how the company manages its interest rate risk  refer to part ii  item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk of this report 
credit risk the company s business of originating and underwriting loans involves credit risk  which is the risk of loss of principal or interest because borrowers  guarantors and related parties fail to perform in accordance with the terms of their loan agreements 
the company has adopted comprehensive credit policies  underwriting standards and loan review procedures and maintains a reserve for loan lease losses to mitigate credit losses 
the company reviews the adequacy of its reserve for loan lease losses on a regular basis to ensure that the reserve is adequate to cover the estimated loss exposure in its portfolio 
management believes that it has established policies and procedures that are appropriate to mitigate the risk of loss 
nonetheless  these policies and procedures may not prevent unexpected losses that could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity 
see part ii  item  loans leases and the reserve for loan lease losses of this report for further discussion of the lending portfolio and the reserve for loan lease losses 
government laws and regulations the company is subject to extensive state and federal laws and regulations  supervision  and legislation that affect how it conducts its business 
the majority of these laws and regulations are for the protection of consumers  depositors and the deposit insurance funds 
any changes to state and federal banking laws and regulations may negatively impact the company s ability to expand services and to increase shareholder value 
there can also be significant cost related to compliance with various laws and regulations 
the company has established an extensive internal control structure to ensure compliance with governing laws and regulations  including those related to financial reporting 
refer to supervision and regulation for additional information on laws and regulations 
the federal reserve s monetary policies also affect the company s operating results and financial condition 
these policies  which include open market operations in us government securities  changes in the discount rate on member bank borrowings  and changes in reserve requirements against member bank deposits  can have a major effect upon the source and cost of funds and the rates of return earned on loans and investments 
the company is subject to state and federal tax laws and regulations 
changes to these regulations could impact future tax expense and the value of deferred tax assets 
article of the new york state tax law  which sets forth the taxation of financial institutions  expired at year end the fiscal budget for new york proposes to make article permanent  and also proposes a change in the tax treatment for real estate investment trusts reit  and a reduction in the state tax rate for financial institutions to 
each of the company s banking subsidiaries is a majority owner in a reit 
if the proposed change is passed in its current form  the expected impact on the company would be an increased tax expense of approximately  competition competition for commercial banking and other financial services is strong in the company s market areas 
the deregulation of the banking industry and the widespread enactment of state laws that permit multi bank holding companies  as well as an increasing level of interstate banking  have created a highly competitive environment for commercial banking 
in one or more aspects of its business  the company s subsidiaries compete with other commercial banks  savings and loan associations  credit unions  finance companies  mutual funds  insurance companies  brokerage and investment banking companies  and other financial intermediaries 
some of these competitors have substantially greater resources and lending capabilities and may offer services that the company does not currently provide 
in addition  many of the company s non bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive federal regulations that govern financial holding companies and federally insured banks 
the company focuses on providing unparalleled customer service  which includes offering a strong suite of products and services 
economic conditions general economic conditions have an impact on the banking industry 
the company s operating results depend on providing products and services to customers in our local market areas 
unemployment rates  real estate values  demographic changes  property tax rates  and local and state governments have an impact on local and regional economic conditions 
an increase in unemployment  a decrease in real estate values  an increase in property tax rates  or a decrease in population could weaken the local economies in which the company operates 
weak economic conditions could lead to credit quality concerns related to repayment ability and collateral protection 
the company operates in three primary market areas which mitigates the impact on local economic conditions and has focused on providing a full suite of products to increase its fee based business as a percentage of total revenues 
operational risk the company is subject to certain operational risks  including  but not limited to  data processing system failures and errors  customer or employee fraud and catastrophic failures resulting from terrorist acts or natural disasters 
the company depends upon data processing  software  communication  and information exchange on a variety of computing platforms and networks and over the internet 
despite instituted safeguards  the company cannot be certain that all of its systems are entirely free from vulnerability to attack or other technological difficulties or failures 
if information security is breached or other technology difficulties or failures occur  information may be lost or misappropriated  services and operations may be interrupted and the company could be exposed to claims from customers 
any of these results could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
the company maintains a system of internal controls to mitigate against such occurrences and maintains insurance coverage for exposures that are insurable 
the company periodically tests internal controls to ensure that they are appropriate and functioning as designed 
technological development and changes the financial services industry is subject to rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology driven products and services 
in addition to improving the company s ability to serve customers  the effective use of technology increases efficiencies and helps to maintain or reduce expenses 
the company s ability to keep pace with technological changes affecting the financial industry and to introduce new products and services based on this new technology will be important to the company s continued success

tompkins was organized in under the laws of the state of new york  as a bank holding company for tompkins trust company  a commercial bank that has operated in ithaca and surrounding communities since forward looking statements the company is making this statement in order to satisfy the safe harbor provision contained in the private securities litigation reform act of the statements contained in this report on form k that are not statements of historical fact may include forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
such forward looking statements are made based on management s expectations and beliefs concerning future events impacting the company and are subject to certain uncertainties and factors relating to the company s operations and economic environment  all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the control of the company  that could cause actual results of the company to differ materially from those matters expressed and or implied by forward looking statements 
the following factors are among those that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements changes in general economic  market and regulatory conditions  the development of an interest rate environment that may adversely affect the company s interest rate spread  other income or cash flow anticipated from the company s operations  investment and or lending activities  changes in laws and regulations affecting banks  bank holding companies and or financial holding companies  technological developments and changes  the ability to continue to introduce competitive new products and services on a timely  cost effective basis  governmental and public policy changes  including environmental regulation  protection and validity of intellectual property rights  reliance on large customers  and financial resources in the amounts  at the times and on the terms required to support the company s future businesses 
in addition  such forward looking statements could be affected by general industry and market conditions and growth rates  general economic and political conditions  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations  and other factors 
critical accounting policies in the course of the company s normal business activity  management must select and apply many accounting policies and methodologies that lead to the financial results presented in the consolidated financial statements of the company 
some of these policies are more critical than others 
management considers the accounting policy relating to the reserve for loan lease losses reserve to be a critical accounting policy because of the uncertainty and subjectivity inherent in estimating the levels of reserve needed to cover probable credit losses within the loan portfolio and the material effect that these estimates can have on the company s results of operations 
the company has developed a methodology to measure the amount of estimated loan loss exposure inherent in the loan portfolio to ensure that an adequate reserve is maintained 
the methodology includes an estimate of exposure for the following specifically reviewed and graded loans  historical loss experience by product type  past due and nonperforming loans  and other internal and external factors such as local and regional economic conditions  growth trends  and credit policy and underwriting standards 
the methodology includes a review of loans considered impaired in accordance with the statement of financial accounting standards sfaf no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  as well as other commercial loans and commercial mortgage loans that are evaluated using an internal rating system 
an estimated exposure amount is assigned to these internally reviewed credits based upon a review of the borrower s financial condition  payment history  collateral adequacy  and business conditions 
for commercial loans and commercial mortgage loans not specifically reviewed  and for more homogenous loan portfolios such as residential mortgage loans and consumer loans  estimated exposure amounts are assigned based upon historical loss experience as well as past due status 
lastly  additional reserves are maintained based upon management judgment and assessment of other quantitative and qualitative factors such as regional and local economic conditions and portfolio growth trends 
since the methodology is based upon historical experience and trends as well as management s judgment  factors may arise that result in different estimations 
significant factors that could give rise to changes in these estimates may include  but are not limited to  changes in economic conditions in the local area  concentration of risk  and declines in local property values 
while management s evaluation of the reserve for loan lease losses as of december   considers the reserve to be adequate  under adversely different conditions or assumptions  the company would need to increase the reserve 
another critical accounting policy is the policy for pensions and post retirement benefits 
expenses and liabilities associated with the company s pension and post retirement benefit plans are based on estimates of future salary increases  employment levels  employee retention  discount rates  life expectancies  and the long term rates of investment returns 
changes in these assumptions due to market conditions  governing laws and regulations  or company specific circumstances may result in material changes to the company s pension and post retirement expenses 
all accounting policies are important and the reader of the financial statements should review these policies  described in note summary of significant accounting policies in notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this form k  to gain a better understanding of how the company s financial performance is reported 
results of operations comparison of december  and results general net income for the year ended december   was up to million  compared to million in on a per share basis  the company earned per diluted share in  compared to per diluted share in in addition to earnings per share growth  key performance measurements for the company include return on average shareholders equity roe and return on average assets roa 
roe was in  compared to in  while roa was in  up from in roa and roe for tompkins continue to compare favorably to bank holding company peer ratios widely available from the federal reserve board 
the favorable performance in over reflects continued execution of the company s key business strategies  including a commitment to community banking through diversified revenue sources consisting of net interest income generated from the loan and securities portfolios  trust and investment services income  insurance commissions and fees  and other service charges and fees for providing banking and related financial services 
evidence of the success of these strategies includes the growth in total loans and the growth in core deposits total deposits less time deposits of  and more  brokered deposits  and municipal money market deposits from december  to december   as well as growth in key fee income categories as discussed below 
noninterest income also benefited from the company s recent agreement with nova information systems nova to transfer customer service  processing services  and support operations for all merchant card processing customers 
the agreement calls for nova to receive all future revenue from the company s current merchant customers  and resulted in a pre tax net gain of approximately million in the fourth quarter 
tompkins will continue to generate referral fees and income based on a percentage of net sales revenue from new customers referred to nova 
an interest rate environment of rising short term rates and stable long term rates made a challenging year 
increases in the yields on the company s average earning assets were offset by increases in the company s cost of funds  resulting in a flat net interest margin for the year when compared to year over year loan growth of was a key factor contributing to the increase in net interest income to million in asset quality remained strong with reductions in nonperforming assets and net charge offs compared with prior year

taxable equivalent net interest income improved to million in  up from million in taxable equivalent net interest income benefited from growth in average earning assets and growth in deposits 
the federal reserve continued to raise short term interest rates in  which contributed to a basis point increase in the prime rate in the higher prime rate had a favorable impact on commercial loan yields as the company s prime rate based loans repriced upwards 
the higher short term interest rates also led to increased funding costs as rates on deposits and borrowings moved upwards 
while short term rates rose  the spread between long term and short term rates narrowed as longer term rates did not increase in line with short term rates 
the yield on average earning assets increased basis points from for the fiscal year ended december   to for fiscal  while the cost of interest bearing liabilities increased basis points from to over the same time period  resulting in an basis point decline in the net interest spread

yields on commercial and industrial loans  and commercial real estate loans benefited from increases in market interest rates 
home equity loan yields were also higher as initial introductory rates repriced to fully indexed rates 
increases in taxable equivalent interest income were partially offset by a increase in interest expense driven by the rise in short term market interest rates 
rates on time deposits moved higher with the rise in short term rates and resulted in an increased volume of these deposits 
core deposits  which include demand deposits  savings accounts  non municipal money market accounts  and time deposits less than  represent the company s largest and lowest cost funding source

average balances on these non core funding sources increased by million from million at year end  to million at year end average time deposits of  or more increased by million to million at year end upward movement in time deposit interest rates beginning in the latter half of contributed to the growth in this deposit category 
growth in core and non core deposits allowed for a reduction in average borrowings and securities sold under repurchase agreements from to changes in net interest income occur from a combination of changes in the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and in the rate of interest earned or paid on them

the reserve for loan lease losses management reviews the adequacy of the reserve for loan lease losses reserve on a regular basis 
management considers the accounting policy relating to the reserve to be a critical accounting policy  given the inherent uncertainty in evaluating the levels of the reserve required to cover credit losses in the portfolio and the material effect that assumptions could have on the company s results of operations 
factors considered in determining the adequacy of the reserve and the related provision include management s approach to granting new credit  the ongoing monitoring of existing credits by the internal and external loan review functions  the growth and composition of the loan lease portfolio  comments received during the course of independent examinations  current local economic conditions  past due and nonperforming loan statistics  the impact of competition on loan structuring and pricing  the estimated values of collateral  and a historical review of loan lease loss experience 
the company has developed a methodology to measure the amount of estimated loan loss exposure inherent in the loan portfolio to ensure that an adequate reserve is maintained 
the methodology includes an estimate of exposure for the following specifically reviewed and graded loans  historical loss experience by product type  past due and nonperforming loans  and other internal and external factors such as local and regional economic conditions  growth trends  and credit policy and underwriting standards 
the methodology includes a review of loans considered impaired in accordance with the statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  as well as other commercial loans and commercial mortgage loans that are evaluated using an internal rating system 
an estimated exposure amount is assigned to these internally reviewed credits based upon a review of the borrower s financial condition  payment history  collateral adequacy  and business conditions 
for commercial loans and commercial mortgage loans not specifically reviewed  and for homogenous loan portfolios such as residential mortgage loans and consumer loans  estimated exposure amounts are assigned based upon historical loss experience  past due status  and management s judgment of the effects of recent and forecasted economic conditions on portfolio performance 
lastly  additional reserves are maintained based upon management judgment and assessment of other quantitative and qualitative factors such as regional and local economic conditions  concentrations of credit  industry concerns  adverse market changes in estimated or appraised collateral value  and portfolio growth trends 
since the methodology is based upon historical experience and trends as well as management s judgment  factors may arise that result in different estimations 
significant factors that could give rise to changes in these estimates may include  but are not limited to  changes in economic conditions in the local area  concentration of risk  changes in interest rates  and declines in local property values 
while management s evaluation of the reserve for loan lease losses as of december   considers the reserve to be adequate  under adversely different conditions or assumptions  the company would need to increase the reserve 
the allocation of the company s reserve as of december   and each of the previous four years is illustrated in table allocation of the reserve for loan lease losses  below 
table allocation of the reserve for loan lease losses december dollar amounts in thousands total loans outstanding at end of year      allocation of the reserve by loan type commercial      real estate      consumer and all other      unallocated   total      allocation of the reserve as a percentage of total reserve commercial real estate consumer and all other unallocated total loan lease types as a percentage of total loans leases commercial real estate consumer and all other total management is committed to early recognition of loan problems and to maintaining an adequate reserve 
the above allocation is neither indicative of the specific amounts or the loan categories in which future charge offs may occur  nor is it an indicator of future loss trends 
the allocation of the reserve to each category does not restrict the use of the reserve to absorb losses in any category 
the increase in the reserve between year end and year end reflects higher allocations due to growth in the loan portfolio and additional allocations for specifically reviewed and graded loans 
the level of future charge offs are dependent upon a variety of factors such as national and local economic conditions  trends in various industries  underwriting characteristics  and conditions unique to each borrower 
given uncertainties surrounding these factors  it is difficult to estimate future losses

conditions have been improving in this market area 
management reviews the loan portfolio continuously for evidence of potential problem loans leases 
potential problem loans leases are loans leases that are currently performing in accordance with contractual terms  but where known information about possible credit problems of the related borrowers causes management to have doubt as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the present loan payment terms and may result in disclosure of such loans leases as nonperforming at sometime in the future 
management considers loans leases classified as substandard  which continue to accrue interest  to be potential problem loans leases 
the company  through its internal loan review function identified commercial relationships totaling million at december   and commercial relationships totaling million at december   which it classified as substandard  which continue to accrue interest 
these loans remain in a performing status due to a variety of factors  including payment history  the value of collateral supporting the credits  and personal or government guarantees 
these factors  when considered in the aggregate  give management reason to believe that the current risk exposure on these loans does not warrant accounting for these loans as nonperforming 
approximately million of these loans are backed by guarantees of us government agencies 
while in a performing status as of december   these loans exhibit certain risk factors  which have the potential to cause them to become nonperforming 
accordingly  management s attention is focused on these credits  which are reviewed on at least a quarterly basis 
deposits and other liabilities total deposits of billion at december   reflected an increase of million over total deposits at december  deposit growth consisted of core deposits  which increased by million  and time deposits of  or more  which were up million 
municipal money market deposits were down by million to million 
the rise in short term market rates led to competitive pressures to increase the rates on time deposits over the period causing consumers  businesses and municipalities to move excess funds from lower yielding savings and money markets to time deposits 
deposits growth occurred at all three of the company s banking subsidiaries and included growth in mature bank offices as well as newer bank offices 
bank offices opened less than years  as of december   contributed million to the growth in  while the remaining million of growth was in offices opened over years

liquidity management the objective of liquidity management is to ensure the availability of adequate funding sources to satisfy the demand for credit  deposit withdrawals  and business investment opportunities 
the company s large  stable core deposit base and strong capital position are the foundation for the company s liquidity position 
asset and liability positions are monitored primarily through asset liability management committees of the company s subsidiary banks individually and on a combined basis 
these committees review periodic reports on the liquidity and interest rate sensitivity positions 
comparisons with industry and peer groups are also monitored 
the company s strong reputation in the communities it serves  along with its strong financial condition  provide access to numerous sources of liquidity as described below 
management believes these diverse liquidity sources provide sufficient means to meet all demands on the company s liquidity that are reasonably likely to occur 
core deposits remain a key funding source  increasing by million to billion at year end core deposits represented of total deposits and of total liabilities at december  compared to of total deposits and of total liabilities at december  contributing to the growth in core deposits is the company s continued focus on demand deposit growth  which increased million or year over year 
non core funding sources  which include time deposits of  or more  brokered time deposits  municipal money market accounts  repurchase agreements  and other borrowings  increased by million between year end and year end  from million to million 
as a percentage of total liabilities  non core funding sources increased from at year end to at year end the increase in the dollar volume of non core funding was concentrated in time deposits of  or more 
rates on these products began to move upwards due to competitive market conditions 
the increase in time deposits of  or more was partially offset by a reduction of municipal money market balances  as municipal customers looked to maximize their returns by moving to short term time deposits 
non core funding sources may require securities to be pledged against the underlying liability 
securities carried at million and million at december  and  respectively  were pledged as collateral for public deposits and other borrowings  and pledged or sold under agreements to repurchase 
pledged securities represented of total securities at december   compared to of total securities at december  the company s liquidity is enhanced by ready access to national and regional wholesale funding sources including federal funds purchased  repurchase agreements  negotiable certificates of deposit  and fhlb advances

at december   the unused borrowing capacity on established lines with the fhlb was million 
as members of the fhlb  the company s subsidiary banks can use unencumbered mortgage related assets to secure additional borrowings from the fhlb 
at december   total unencumbered residential real estate assets were million 
additional assets may also qualify as collateral for fhlb advances upon approval of the fhlb 
short term investments  consisting of securities with maturities of one year or less  totaled million at year end and million at year end cash flow from the loan and investment portfolios provides a significant source of liquidity 
these assets may have stated maturities in excess of one year  but have monthly interest payments and principal reductions 
total mortgage backed securities  at fair value  were million at december  compared with million at december  using current prepayment assumptions  cash flow from the investment portfolio is estimated to be approximately million in investments in residential mortgage loans  consumer loans  and leases totaled approximately million at december  aggregate amortization from monthly payments on these loan assets provides significant additional cash flow to the company

the fsp also addresses accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other than temporary impairment on a debt security  and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other than temporary impairments

under the fsp  impairment losses must be recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the security s cost and its fair value at the financial statement date  without considering partial recoveries subsequent to that date 
the fsp also requires that an investor recognize an other than temporary impairment loss when a decision to sell a security has been made and the investor does not expect the fair value of the security to fully recover prior to the expected time of sale

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk interest rate risk is the primary market risk category associated with the company s operations 
interest rate risk refers to the volatility of earnings caused by changes in interest rates 
the company manages interest rate risk using income simulation to measure interest rate risk inherent in its on balance sheet and off balance sheet financial instruments at a given point in time by showing the potential effect of interest rate shifts on net interest income for future periods 
each quarter the company s asset liability management committee reviews the simulation results to determine whether the exposure of net interest income to changes in interest rates remains within board approved levels 
the committee also discusses strategies to manage this exposure and incorporates these strategies into the investment and funding decisions of the company 
the company does not use derivatives  such as interest rate swaps  to manage its interest rate risk exposure 
table interest rate risk analysis below is a condensed static gap report  which illustrates the anticipated repricing intervals of assets and liabilities as of december  the analysis reflects sensitivity to rising rates in all repricing intervals shown 
this analysis suggests that the company s net interest income is more vulnerable to a rising rate environment than it is to sustained low interest rates 
table interest rate risk analysis condensed static gap december  repricing interval cumulative dollar amounts in thousands total months months months months interest earning assets      interest bearing liabilities      net gap position     net gap position as a percentage of total assets balances of available for sale securities are shown at amortized cost 
the company s board of directors has set a policy that interest rate risk exposure will remain within a range whereby net interest income will not decline by more than in one year as a result of a basis point change in rates 
based upon the simulation analysis performed as of december   a basis point upward shift in interest rates over a one year time frame would result in a one year decline in net interest income of approximately  assuming no balance sheet growth and no management action to address balance sheet mismatches 
the same simulation indicates that a basis point decline in interest rates over a one year period would result in a decrease in net interest income of 
the negative exposure in a rising rate environment is mainly driven by the repricing assumptions of the company s core deposit base and the lag in the repricing of the company s adjustable rate assets 
longer term  the impact of a rising rate environment is positive as the asset base continues to reset at higher levels  while the repricing of the rate sensitive liabilities moderates 
the negative exposure in the basis point decline scenario results from the company s assets repricing downward more rapidly than the rates on the company s interest bearing liabilities  mainly deposits  as deposit rates are at low levels given the historically low interest rate environment experienced in recent years 
the aforementioned percentage changes in net interest income are from our base case scenario 
in our most recent simulation  the base case scenario  which assumes interest rates remain unchanged from the date of the simulation  showed a relatively flat net interest margin during in the present interest rate environment 
although the simulation model is useful in identifying potential exposure to interest rate movements  actual results may differ from those modeled as the repricing  maturity  and prepayment characteristics of financial instruments may change to a different degree than modeled 
in addition  the model does not reflect actions that management may employ to manage its interest rate risk exposure 
the company s current liquidity profile  capital position  and growth prospects  offer a level of flexibility for management to take actions that could offset some of the negative effects of unfavorable movements in interest rates 
management believes the current exposure to changes in interest rates is not significant in relation to the earnings and capital strength of the company additional information regarding market risk of the company s financial instruments at december  is provided in table repricing intervals of selected financial instruments below
