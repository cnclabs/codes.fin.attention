item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview adtran  inc designs  develops  manufactures  markets  and services a broad range of high speed network access products utilized by providers of telecommunications services and enterprise end users 
we currently sell our products to a large number of service providers  including the four largest telecommunications providers  and to private and public enterprises worldwide 
sales increased this year compared to last year due to our strategy of increasing unit volume and market share through the introduction of new products and succeeding generations of products having lower selling prices and increased functionality as compared to both the prior generation of a product and to the products of competitors 
an important part of our strategy is to reduce the cost of each succeeding product generation and then to lower the product s selling price based on the cost savings achieved 
as a part of this strategy  we seek in most instances to be a high quality  low cost provider of products in our markets 
our success to date is attributable in large measure to our ability to design our products initially with a view to their subsequent redesign  allowing both increased functionality and reduced manufacturing costs in each succeeding product generation 
this strategy enables us to sell succeeding generations of products to existing customers  while increasing our market share by selling these enhanced products to new customers 
the year over year increase in our systems revenue is primarily attributable to increasing sales of dslams  optical access products  m multiplexers  and netvanta products 
our dslams consolidate broadband traffic and provide the technology that allows phone companies to compete with cable companies in the high speed internet service market 
the year over year increase in hdsl t revenue is primarily attributable to increasing carrier networks sales of hdsl based total access broadband platform products  partially offset by declining enterprise networks sales of channel service units data service units csu dsu products 
the increase in hdsl revenue is the result of migration from non intelligent legacy hardware to intelligent remote monitoring access hardware and a result of market share gains 
the industry has integrated the functionality of csu dsus into access routers  thereby reducing the requirement for a standalone csu dsu

index to financial statements the year over year decrease in dbt total reach sales is the result of newer and higher speed technologies replacing the lower speed technology of isdn and dds products 
we have maintained our overall market share in dbt total reach and continue to take advantage of market opportunities for these products where speed is not the main consideration however  dbt total reach is a declining market  which is being cannibalized by higher speed dsl technology 
our operating results have fluctuated on a quarterly basis in the past  and operating results may vary significantly in future periods due to a number of factors 
we normally operate with very little order backlog 
the majority of our sales in each quarter result from orders booked in that quarter and firm purchase orders released in that quarter by customers under agreements containing non binding purchase commitments 
many of our customers require prompt delivery of products 
this results in a limited backlog of orders for these products and requires us to maintain sufficient inventory levels to satisfy anticipated customer demand 
if near term demand for our products declines  or if potential sales in any quarter do not occur as anticipated  our financial results could be adversely affected 
operating expenses are relatively fixed in the short term  therefore  a shortfall in quarterly revenues could significantly impact our financial results in a given quarter 
maintaining sufficient inventory levels to assure prompt delivery of our products increases the amount of inventory which may become obsolete and increases the risk that the obsolescence of this inventory may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results 
our operating results may also fluctuate as a result of a number of other factors  including increased competition  customer order patterns  changes in product mix  timing differences between price decreases and product cost reductions  product warranty returns  and announcements of new products by us or our competitors 
accordingly  our historical financial performance is not necessarily a meaningful indicator of future results  and  in general  management expects that our financial results may vary from period to period 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
these policies have been consistently applied across our two reportable segments carrier networks division and enterprise networks division 
we review customer contracts to determine if all of the requirements for revenue recognition have been met prior to recording revenues from sales transactions 
we generally record sales revenue upon shipment of our products  net of any rebates or discounts  since i we generally do not have significant post delivery obligations  ii the product price is fixed or determinable  iii collection of the resulting receivable is probable  and iv product returns are reasonably estimable 
we generally ship products upon receipt of a purchase order from a customer 
we evaluate shipping terms and we record revenue on products shipped in accordance with the applicable terms of each respective contract  generally fob shipping point 
in the case of consigned inventory  revenue is recognized when the customer assumes the risks and rewards of ownership of the product 
we record revenue associated with installation services when the installation and all contractual obligations are complete 
when contracts include both installation and product sales  the installation is considered as a separate deliverable item 
either the purchaser  adtran  or a third party can perform installation of our products 
sales returns are accrued based on historical sales return experience  which we believe provides a reasonable estimate of future returns 
the majority of enterprise networks products are sold in the united states through a non exclusive distribution network of major technology distributors 
these organizations then distribute to an extensive network of value added resellers and system integrators 
value added resellers and system integrators may be affiliated with us as a channel partner  or they may purchase from the distributor in an unaffiliated fashion 
additionally  our distributors may return unused and unopened product for stock balancing purposes when these returns are accompanied by offsetting orders for products of equal or greater value 
we participate in cooperative advertising and market development programs with certain customers 
we use these programs to reimburse customers for certain forms of advertising  and in general  to allow our customers credits up to a specified percentage of their net purchases 
our costs associated with these programs are estimated and accrued at the time of sale and are included in selling  general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of income 
we also participate in rebate programs to provide sales incentives for certain products 
our costs associated with these programs are estimated and accrued at the time of sale and are recorded as a reduction of sales in our consolidated statements of income 
prior to accepting a new customer  we perform a detailed credit review of the customer 
credit limits are established for each new customer based on the results of this credit review 
payment terms are established for each new customer  and collection experience is reviewed periodically in order to determine if the customer s payment terms and credit limits need to be revised 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make 
table of contents 
index to financial statements payments  we may be required to make additional allowances 
if circumstances change with regard to individual receivable balances that have previously been determined to be uncollectible and for which a specific reserve has been established  a reduction in our allowance for doubtful accounts may be required 
our allowance for doubtful accounts was million at december  and million at december  we carry our inventory at the lower of cost or market  with cost being determined using the first in  first out method 
we use standard costs for material  labor  and manufacturing overhead to value our inventory 
our standard costs are updated on a monthly basis and any variances are expensed in the current period  therefore  our inventory costs approximate actual costs at the end of each reporting period 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  we may be required to make additional inventory write downs 
our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory was million and million at december  and  respectively 
inventory write downs charged to the reserve were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the objective of our short term investment policy is to preserve principal and maintain adequate liquidity with appropriate diversification  while emphasizing market returns on our monetary assets 
the objective of our long term investment policy is principal preservation and total return  that is  the aggregate return from capital appreciation  dividend income  and interest income 
these objectives are achieved through investments with appropriate diversification in fixed and variable rate income securities  public equity  and private equity portfolios 
we have experienced significant volatility in the market prices of our publicly traded equity investments 
these investments are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of tax 
the ultimate realized value on these equity investments is subject to market price volatility until they are sold 
we review our investment portfolio for potential other than temporary declines in value on an individual investment basis 
we assess  on a quarterly basis  significant declines in value which may be considered other than temporary and  if necessary  recognize and record the appropriate charge to write down the carrying value of such investments 
in making this assessment  we take into consideration a wide range of objective and subjective information  including but not limited to the following the magnitude and duration of historical decline in market prices  credit rating activity  assessments of liquidity  public filings  and statements made by the issuer 
we generally begin our identification of potential other than temporary impairments by reviewing any security with a market value that has declined from its original or adjusted cost basis by for more than six months 
we then evaluate the individual security based on the previously identified factors to determine the amount of the write down  if any 
actual losses  if any  could ultimately differ from these estimates 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in additional losses that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
we also invest in privately held entities and record our investments in these entities at cost 
we review our investments in these entities periodically in order to determine if circumstances both financial and non financial exist that indicate that we will not recover our initial investment 
impairment charges are recorded on investments having a cost basis that is greater than the value that we would reasonably expect to receive in an arm s length sale of the investment 
in we recorded a write down of our cost basis investments of million 
this write down is included in net realized investment gains losses in the accompanying consolidated statement of income 
we estimate our income tax provision or benefit in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate  including estimating exposures related to examinations by taxing authorities 
we also make judgments regarding the realization of deferred tax assets 
the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets is based on our belief that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions to realize these deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance has been established for deferred tax assets which we do not believe meet the more likely than not criteria established by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
our estimates regarding future taxable income and income tax provision or benefit may vary due to changes in market conditions  changes in tax laws  or other factors 
if our assumptions  and consequently our estimates  change in the future  the valuation allowances we have established may be increased or decreased  impacting future income tax expense 
for  and  the valuation allowance was million  million and million  respectively 
this valuation allowance is included in non current deferred tax liabilities in the accompanying balance sheets 
our products generally include warranties of one to ten years for product defects 
we accrue for warranty returns based on our estimate of the cost to repair or replace the defective products at the time revenue is recognized 
we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers 

table of contents 
index to financial statements adtran s products continue to become more complex in both size and functionality as many of our product offerings migrate from line card applications to systems products 
these products will require more warranty repairs to be completed at the installed location due to their size and complexity  rather than at a manufacturing site or repair depot 
this field service obligation  as well as the increasing complexity of our products  will cause warranty obligations  when they arise  to be more costly 
our estimates regarding future warranty obligations may change due to product failure rates  material usage  and other rework costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
in addition  from time to time  specific warranty accruals may be made if unforeseen problems arise 
should our actual experience relative to these factors be worse than our estimates  we will be required to record additional warranty expense 
alternatively  if we provide more reserves than we need  we will reverse a portion of such provisions in future periods 
the liability for warranty returns totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
these liabilities are included in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets
