interest rate risk we have risk management practices and programs to manage the interest rate risks associated with our mortgage origination and financing activities 
we enter into derivative financial instrument transactions solely for risk management purposes 
the decision of whether or not to mitigate interest rate risks  or a portion thereof  is determined by senior management through the applicable committee and is based on the risks involved and other factors  including the financial effect on income  asset valuation and compliance with reit income tests 
in determining whether to mitigate a risk  we may consider whether other assets  liabilities  firm commitments and anticipated transactions already offset or reduce the risk 
all of our derivative financial instruments are entered into with a view towards reducing the potential for economic losses that we could incur 
from the time a mortgage loan is in the pipeline until it is sold as a whole loan or in securitized form in the secondary market through gse sponsored programs  we have exposure to interest rate and credit risk 
interest rate risk is a primary risk exposure for us 
a change in interest rates can affect us in the following ways it can change the interest income we receive from our mortgage loans held for investment as well as mortgage loans held for sale  it can change the market values of mortgage loans held for sale and investment  as well as the values of the related mortgage properties serving as collateral  it can change the interest expense we pay to fund and finance our mortgage loans  and it can change the value of the derivative financial instruments we use to manage our interest rate risk 
we use various techniques to estimate the potential effects from various interest rate scenarios 
our loans held for investment as of december  were primarily comprised of hybrid adjustable rate loans  which carry an initial fixed coupon rate for the first three  five  seven or ten years  with interest rates that reset either annually or every six months thereafter based on libor plus a margin 
in addition  a portion of the loans that are held for investment are mortgage loans that have interest rates that change at one month or six month intervals based on changes in libor 
these mortgage loans also have lifetime caps maximum allowed interest rates 
the table below shows the change in net interest income  we estimate would occur from and basis point increases and decreases in interest rates based upon current funding and derivative financial instrument positions at december  and this estimate reflects instantaneous changes that are then held constant for one year

the interest rates on adjustable rate mortgage loans reset at various intervals and are generally subject to lifetime caps  while the rates on fixed rate loans do not change 
we also originate hybrid loans with both fixed and variable pricing components 
we presently do not believe that we have significant interest rate risk on our loans held for sale under most of the interest rate scenarios we believe likely to occur 
however  should interest rates move significantly before we sell the loans  then we would be more significantly affected by the change in interest rates 
changes in market interest rates affect our estimates of the fair value of our mortgage loans held for sale  irlcs and the fair value of our derivative financial instruments which relate to these instruments  including forward sales of mortgage backed securities and treasury notes 
the following table summarizes the sensitivity of the fair value of our mortgage loans held for sale and irlcs and of the related derivative financial instruments to instantaneous shifts of various magnitudes in the yield curve basis points basis points basis points basis points dollars in millions as of december  change in fair value of mortgage loans held for sale and irlcs change in fair value of derivative financial instruments related to loans held for sale and irlcs net change as of december  change in fair value of mortgage loans held for sale and irlcs change in fair value of derivative financial instruments related to loans held for sale and irlcs net change irlcs are derivative financial instruments as defined by sfas no 
and must be recorded at fair value on the balance sheet 
however  unlike most other derivative financial instruments  there is no active market for irlcs that can be used to determine their fair value 
we estimate the fair value of irlcs based on the change in estimated fair value of the underlying mortgage loan  weighted by the probability that the loan will fund within the terms of the rate lock commitment 
the change in fair value of the underlying mortgage loan is based upon the quoted prices of mbs and is measured from the lock date 
therefore  at the time of issuance  the estimated fair value of an irlc is zero 
subsequent to issuance  the fair value of irlcs can be either positive or negative  depending on the change in value of the underlying mortgage loan 
the probability that the loan will fund within the terms of the irlc is driven by a number of factors  in particular  the change  if any  in mortgage rates subsequent to the lock date 
in general  the probability of closing and funding the loan increases if mortgage rates rise and decreases if mortgage rates fall 
this is due primarily to the relative attractiveness of current mortgage rates compared to the applicant s committed rate 
the probability that a loan will fund within the terms of the irlc also is influenced by the source of the applications  age of the applications  purpose for the loans ie  purchase or refinance and the application approval rate 
we have developed estimates of the mortgages that will not close fall out using empirical data that take into account these variables  as well as renegotiations of rate and point commitments that tend to occur when mortgage rates fall 
the fallout estimates are utilized to estimate the quantity of loans that will fund within the terms of the irlcs 
at december   the fair value of our irlcs was approximately million  and the corresponding fair value of mandatory forward sale commitments was million 
the corresponding notional values were million and million  respectively 
at december   there were option contracts outstanding with a fair value of less than million and a notional of million 
although not in a designated hedging relationship under sfas no 
 the irlcs and related mandatory trades result in an effective economic hedge 
changes in market interest rates affect our estimates of the fair value of our investment securities 
the table below shows the change in the fair value of our investment securities we estimate would occur from and basis point increases and decreases in interest rates 
this estimate reflects instantaneous changes that are then held constant for one year

credit risk we are exposed to credit risk from the time we fund mortgage loans until they are either sold or the principal balance is repaid in full 
while we have not experienced any significant credit losses to date  in the event of a significant rising interest rate environment and or economic downturn  mortgage loan defaults may increase and result in credit losses that would adversely affect our liquidity and operating results 
this risk will be magnified as we build our portfolio of adjustable rate mortgage loans whose rates increase as the base rate eg  libor increases  subject to contractual limits 
our hedging transactions using derivative financial instruments also involve certain additional risks such as counterparty credit risk and the risk that unanticipated and significant changes in interest rates will cause a significant loss of basis in the contract 
the counterparties to our derivative financial instruments are major financial institutions and securities dealers  which we believe are well capitalized with investment grade credit ratings and with which we may have other financial relationships 
while we do not anticipate nonperformance by any counterparty  we are exposed to potential credit losses in the event the counterparty fails to perform 
our exposure to credit risk in the event of default by a counterparty is the difference between the value of the contract and the current market price at the time of the default 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately protect against the foregoing risks and will ultimately realize an economic benefit that exceeds the related expenses incurred in connection with engaging in such hedging strategies 
our mortgage loans held for investment are also subject to spread risk 
we presently expect that the majority of these loans will be adjustable rate loans valued based on a market credit spread to a benchmark yield such as us treasury security and libor yields 
in other words  their value is dependent on the yield demanded on such securities by the market based on their credit relative to the benchmark yield 
excessive supply of such loans combined with reduced investor demand will generally cause the market to require a higher yield on such securities  resulting in the use of a higher or wider spread over the benchmark yield to value such loans 
under such conditions  the value of our portfolio of mortgage loans held for investment would tend to decline 
conversely  if the spread used to value such loans were to decrease or tighten  the value of our loan portfolio would tend to increase 
such changes in the market value of our loan portfolio may affect our net equity  net income or cash flows directly  or indirectly through their impact on our ability to borrow and access capital
