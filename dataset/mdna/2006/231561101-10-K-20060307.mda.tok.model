many of the key drivers of our business  such as the us economy and the global commercial aerospace industry  improved 
in addition  us military spending levels remained steady and our commercial markets strengthened 
looking forward  however  many factors could impact our future performance  including future defense spending in the us  changes in global gross domestic product  volatility of the geopolitical landscape  and the pace of global economic activity 
general economy many of our industrial businesses are driven in large part by growth of the us gross domestic product gdp 
based upon certain economic reports  the us economy s output real gdp is expected to grow at a modest rate of approximately in  lower than the experienced in gdp is expected to grow at in the first half and in the second half of this forecast is predicated on the assumption that oil prices stabilize in on the positive side  inflation is expected to moderate in the consumer price index a broad indicator of inflation is expected to be approximately in  down from in if these conditions were to occur  it may prompt the us federal reserve to curtail its current program of raising interest rates in according to some economic reports  interest rates are expected to rise slightly in the beginning of and then stabilize 
stabilized interest rates should lead to increased spending and investment in the business sector 
unemployment is expected to drop slightly and remain below in  as the business sector expands after a period of underinvestment in both human and industrial capital 
also  global gdp growth is expected to slow down in  decreasing from in to approximately in  primarily due to higher energy prices and tighter monetary polices 
higher energy costs in affected all of our operating segments  but they were more significant within our metal treatment segment 
approximately of our business is outside the us and subject to currency fluctuations in both transactions in foreign currencies as well as translation from local country currencies to the us dollar 
although we seek to mitigate these fluctuations through hedging programs  there is no guarantee that our hedging efforts will offset the possible adverse impacts of the currency fluctuations 
it appears that  at least in the us  is expected to mark the fifth consecutive year of economic expansion  fueled primarily by strong spending in the business sector  however  we remain cautiously optimistic that this expansion will continue in the near term 
to the extent that it does  our businesses that are largely economic driven  and serve the commercial aerospace  oil and gas  and general industrial markets  particularly our metal treatment segment  are well positioned to benefit from increased economic strength 
defense approximately of our business is in the military sector  predominantly in the us  characterized by long term programs and contracts driven primarily by the us department of defense dod budget 
we also participate in several non us military programs which  although not as significant as our domestic military business  are subject to the uncertainty resulting from the changing geopolitical climate around the world 
the dod budget reflects growing cost pressure to support the global war on terrorism  including supporting the current military operations in both iraq and afghanistan  and initiatives aimed at transforming and modernizing its current military platforms and capabilities 
the war effort has benefited us again in with higher spares sales to the us army 
the fiscal dod procurement budget reflects a overall increase over fiscal the budget includes continued investment funding for key programs supportive of transformation initiatives  but it is balanced with increased spending for modernization and upgrading of existing equipment in support of current global operations and requirements 
we anticipate future dod spending to produce increased investment specifically for unmanned vehicles  to provide stability to the shipbuilding industry while transforming the us navy fleet  and for electronics for military hardware necessary to upgrade existing platforms and facilitate network centric warfare systems  all as part of the military s transformation plans 
military transformation initiatives are providing funding for advanced technologies to support new and enhanced military platforms 
we are involved in several major developmental contracts for our advanced technologies  which support potential future military programs 
page our flow control and motion control segments are well positioned on many high performance defense platforms  including the cvn next generation aircraft carrier  the virginia class nuclear submarine program  the dd x destroyer  the f  the v  the jsf and unmanned aerial vehicle programs  such as the global hawk 
based on our reputation and past performance  we are involved in many of the future military systems that are currently in development 
however  continued cost concerns could lead to extensive review of critical defense programs  which may have an impact on dod budget levels going forward  as could many other factors such as overall budget deficit levels and geopolitical uncertainty 
there is the possibility that defense spending may decrease in the future  which could adversely affect our operations and financial condition 
while dod funding fluctuates year by year and program by program  the primary risk facing us would be the termination of a major program 
other than the possible reduction in the f program  which is not considered material to us as a whole  we are not aware of any potential material program termination for which we have content 
if a material program were to be terminated  the termination process takes several years to wind down  which may provide us ample time to react before any potential impact occurs 
although we monitor the budget process as it relates to programs in which we participate  we can not predict the ultimate impact of future dod budgets on us 
in addition  there are other risks associated with our defense businesses  such as failure of a prime contractor customer to perform on a contract  pricing and or design specifications that may not always be finalized at the time the contract is bid  and the failure and or inability of certain sole source suppliers to provide us product  any of which could have an adverse impact on our financial performance 
while alternatives could be identified to replace a sole source supplier  a transition could result in increased costs and manufacturing delays 
our outlook for our defense business remains positive for the near to intermediate term 
commercial aerospace approximately of our business serves the global commercial aerospace industry 
global airline traffic is one of the primary drivers for long term growth in the commercial aerospace industry  and economic growth is one of the primary drivers of global airline traffic demand 
based on industry reports  global passenger traffic grew approximately in and is expected to grow less than in high fuel costs  security concerns  and stiff competition  especially from low cost airlines  have continued to place profitability pressure on airlines  which continues to slow procurement of new aircraft and extend maintenance schedules 
fuel prices are expected to stabilize in  which  combined with continued global economic growth  should stimulate procurement of new aircraft  a key driver of our commercial aerospace business 
in fact  the two major global aircraft manufacturers experienced record order and backlog levels in and are projecting a healthy increase in deliveries in the impact to our commercial aerospace business is determined by production levels which  based upon the above and other market data  should be healthy in our motion control segment is a provider of oem aerospace components and systems  and repair and overhaul services  while our metal treatment segment provides services to aircraft manufacturers 
both segments experienced solid sales growth in to this market 
while the emergence of low cost carriers and improved economic conditions have contributed to this industry s recovery  concerns still exist regarding the financial weakness of many airlines  continued high fuel prices  and the threat of another major terrorist attack  any of which could have an adverse impact on this industry and our operating results and financial position 
we anticipate continued improvement in the commercial aerospace market in we are well positioned on a number of commercial aerospace platforms and should benefit from improvement in this industry  which is expected to occur over the next couple of years 
power generation there are several factors that might precipitate an expansion in commercial nuclear power  including increasing attention to environmental issues  a pro nuclear us political leadership  and continued growth in global demand for power 
nuclear power has minimal impact on the environment  is one of the most economical forms of generating electricity  and decreases dependence on oil and gas imports 
the us depends on foreign sources for about half of its total energy needs 
because of increased demand for and limited supply of energy in the us  we anticipate that the nuclear power industry will continue to expand in the coming years 
page the us nuclear power industry is expected to grow primarily because most of the existing nuclear power plants have applied for or will be applying for plant life extensions  as required by current regulations 
as of december   approximately plants have received year life extensions  applications from additional plants have been submitted and are pending approval  and letters of intent to apply have been received from more plants 
in addition  duke energy and progress energy each announced in that they intend to apply to the nuclear regulatory commission for a combined construction and operating license col for new nuclear power generation in the us both companies have selected the westinghouse ap reactor design for their new power plant construction 
curtiss wright  through its flow control segment  has significant content on the ap reactor 
if approved  construction could begin as early as internationally  china intends to expand its nuclear power capabilities significantly through the construction of new nuclear power plants over the next several years 
it is currently in the process of selecting a reactor design  which has been narrowed down to the westinghouse ap and areva epr designs 
a decision is expected in these developments  combined with new plant construction in other parts of asia and rest of the world  are expected to drive expansion in this industry 
our flow control segment is well positioned to take advantage of this expansion 
the recent history of plant life extension approvals in the us and continued strong build programs in asia are encouraging 
however  there is no guarantee that the nuclear alternative will continue to be fully endorsed in the us and other parts of the world  or that the nuclear regulatory commission will authorize the construction of new facilities in the us in addition  the geopolitical climate is volatile and could impact future nuclear plant construction levels around the world 
oil and gas the most prevalent drivers that impact this market include capital spending for new construction and upgrades to comply with environmental regulations and maintenance spending to retrofit existing facilities with improved equipment and technologies to increase plant flexibility  reliability  production  safety  and profitability 
additionally  increased demand for oil and natural gas  both domestically and internationally from emerging economies  and increased demand for aftermarket services may also positively impact this market going forward 
we experienced strong sales growth to this market  driven mainly by record orders for our coker valve product 
the current outlook for the petroleum markets is tempered 
according to market data  the recent steady increase in crude oil and petroleum product prices is expected to slow and possibly decline slightly 
many of the same factors that drove world oil markets in  such as low production capacity and rapid demand growth  are expected to continue to affect markets in other factors  such as the frequency and intensity of hurricanes  other extreme weather  and geopolitical instability may also continue to affect this market 
global demand is expected to increase in  primarily due to an increase in the us from a net decline in as well as economic growth in developing asian countries 
global production capacity is expected to increase in and  which should moderate the global oil price increases experienced over the past two years 
us production in was down due to the impact of the severe hurricane season 
refining margins have remained relatively high despite higher crude oil prices  which combined with increased global petrochemical production and continued global economic growth  should lead to increased investment and capital spending by the refineries in and beyond 
based upon market data  capital expenditures in the processing industries are expected to increase over the next few years 
long term global forecasts project a solid increase in sales of flow control products valves  pumps  motors to the processing industries 
as the world continues to depend on natural resources  oil exploration deepens  and transport requirements widen  we anticipate additional opportunities to provide our flow control products to meet these challenges 
the proposed and enacted environmental regulations in the us and other developed countries could drive increased demand for flow control products by as much as to over the next few years 
however  we cannot predict whether certain economic recoveries can be sustained  whether anticipated future environmental regulatory changes will be enacted  or how such regulatory changes may impact this industry 
page results of operations analytical definitions throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  the terms incremental and base are used to explain changes from period to period 
for full year reporting purposes  acquisitions remain segregated for two calendar years 
the remaining businesses are referred to as the base businesses  and growth in these base businesses is referred to as organic 
an acquisition is considered base when the reporting year includes fully comparable current and prior year data 
therefore  for the year ended december   our organic growth of the base businesses excludes all acquisitions since january  the term incremental is used to highlight the impact acquisitions had on the current year results  for which there was no comparable prior year period 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  for the year ended december   we recorded consolidated net sales of  million and net earnings of million  or per diluted share 
sales for increased over sales of million 
net earnings for increased from net earnings of million  or per diluted share 
the increase in revenues was mainly driven by a complete year of revenues generated from our acquisitions  primarily dy systems  primagraphics  nova machine  trentec  groquip  synergy  and epd  and the acquisition of indal 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding acquisitions 
these acquisitions contributed million in incremental sales in or of the total sales increase from 
our base businesses experienced organic sales growth of in  led by the metal treatment segment  which grew organically by 
our flow control and motion control segments experienced solid organic sales growth of and  respectively 
in our base businesses  our coker valve products continue to gain customer acceptance  which has driven the flow control organic sales increase of million to the oil and gas market 
the motion control segment experienced higher sales of our oem and spares products and repair and overhaul services to the commercial aerospace market of million  mainly due to the increased production requirements and the continued improvement in the commercial aerospace market 
metal treatment sales of our global shot peening services increased million  primarily in the commercial aerospace and automotive markets  due mainly to the continuing recovery of the global economy and customer production requirements 
in addition  we experienced organic growth in our defense markets in both our motion control and flow control segments  which increased sales by million and million  respectively  over foreign currency translation had a favorable impact on sales of million in as compared to operating income for totaled million  an increase of from operating income of million in the increase is primarily attributed to higher sales volume  favorable mix  and previously implemented cost reduction initiatives 
operating income in experienced organic growth of and was driven by our metal treatment and motion control segments  which experienced organic growth of and  respectively  from the prior year 
metal treatment s organic operating income growth was mainly the result of higher volume while motion control s organic growth was due to higher volume  favorable sales mix from commercial aerospace spares and aftermarket services  and implemented cost control initiatives 
organic operating income growth in our flow control segment was in  due to higher volume 
the contributions of the and acquisitions amounted to million in incremental operating income in compared to  keeping the overall operating segment margin flat in compared to the operating margin of our segments have been somewhat lower than historical levels in recent years  principally related to the large number of acquisitions made since although the new acquisitions continue to have a positive effect on operating income  the operating margin of the overall corporation is lower since the margin level of the newly acquired companies are below those of our base businesses 
we consider this to be a temporary issue that should be more than offset by the benefits of diversification  the implementation of cost control measures  and increased future profitability 
the integration of our acquisitions continues to progress as planned 
in addition to having improved operating margins for almost all of our recent acquisitions  we have initiated programs to cross market products and share technologies across our businesses 
foreign currency translation had a favorable impact on operating income of million for as compared to page in addition to the strong organic growth of the segments  we experienced favorable results in compared to from lower environmental remediation costs  which declined million  a gain on the sale of property for million  and lower costs associated with sarbanes oxley section compliance of million 
these favorable impacts were offset by higher research and development  selling  general  and administrative expenses  mainly due to the and acquisitions 
in addition  we incurred additional infrastructure costs to support our business growth and higher pension expense 
we incurred higher interest expense due to higher interest rates  which accounted for approximately of the increase  and higher debt levels associated with the funding of our acquisition program 
net earnings in included certain one time tax benefits of million  which primarily resulted from the change in legal structure of one of our subsidiaries and a favorable irs appeals settlement 
backlog at december  was million compared with million at december  and million at december  acquisitions made during represented million of the backlog at december  new orders received in totaled  million  which represents a increase over new orders of million and a increase over new orders received in acquisitions made during and contributed million in incremental new orders received in record orders for our flow control coker valve and strong orders for our motion control electronic and mechanical products drove the new order improvement 
our metal treatment services  repair and overhaul services  and after market sales  which represent approximately of our total sales for  are sold with very modest lead times 
accordingly  the backlog for these businesses is less of an indication of future sales than the backlog of the majority of the products and services of our motion control and flow control segments  in which a significant portion of sales is derived from long term contracts 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  we recorded consolidated net sales of million and net earnings of million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  sales for increased over sales of million 
net earnings for increased from net earnings of million  or per diluted share 
the increase in revenues was mainly driven by a complete year of revenues generated from our acquisitions of systran  novatronics pickering  e m engineered coatings solutions  advanced materials process  and collins technology and contributions from our acquisitions  primarily dy systems  primagraphics  nova machine  trentec  groquip  synergy  and epd 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding acquisitions 
these acquisitions made in and contributed million in incremental sales in or of the total sales increase from 
our remaining base business units experienced organic sales growth of in  led by the metal treatment segment  which grew organically by 
the flow control and motion control segments experienced solid organic sales growth of and  respectively 
the organic growth in the flow control segment was achieved in despite a decrease in overall revenue from the us navy of approximately million 
in our base businesses  higher metal treatment sales of our global shot peening  laser peening  and heat treating services of million  higher sales of certain flow control products to the power generation market of million  the oil and gas industry of million  and the defense electronics markets of million  and higher sales of our motion control products to the military aerospace market of million and commercial aerospace aftermarket services of million all contributed to the organic sales growth for compared to these increases in our base businesses were partially offset by lower sales of certain flow control products to the us navy due to timing of contractual revenues  a decrease of million  and lower sales of motion control electronic products of million for use in global ground defense markets because of the wind down on certain production projects 
favorable foreign currency translation had a favorable impact on sales of million for compared to operating income for totaled million  an increase of from operating income of million in the increase is primarily attributed to higher sales volume  favorable mix  and previously implemented cost reduction initiatives 
the contributions of our and acquisitions amounted to million in incremental operating income in compared to in addition to the contribution of these acquisitions  operating income benefited from organic growth in our remaining base businesses  which improved overall and was driven by strong organic growth in our metal treatment and motion control segments of and  respectively  from the improvement in metal treatment s base businesses operating income page was the result of higher volume and favorable sales mix due to the higher laser peening sales 
the improvement in the motion control s base businesses operating income came from higher volume  reductions in certain reserve requirements  favorable sales mix from commercial aerospace aftermarket services and spares  and implemented cost control initiatives 
operating income from the base businesses within our flow control segment increased in over  due to higher volume  contract cost overruns and inventory write offs in that did not reoccur in  and a stronger sales mix for our power generation products 
the increase was partially offset by the lower overall volume to the us navy  driven by the profit impact related to the two large higher margin contracts in that did not reoccur in additionally  we increased our reserves for environmental remediation during  resulting in a million increase in environmental remediation and administrative expenses over foreign currency translation had a favorable impact on operating income of million for as compared to overall consolidated operating margins were down slightly in compared to strong margins within our business segments were achieved despite the absorption of million of environmental costs  million in costs associated with sarbanes oxley section compliance  and lower pension income of million in  due to additional costs resulting from the acquisitions and slightly lower investment returns 
the increase in net earnings for compared to is mainly due to higher segment operating income 
the improvement in operating income in was partially offset by higher interest expense caused by higher debt levels associated with the funding of our acquisition program  which accounted for approximately of the increase  and higher interest rates 
net earnings for included certain one time tax benefits of million 
the tax benefits primarily resulted from the change in legal structure of one of our subsidiaries and a favorable irs appeals settlement relating to the tax year 
segment performance we operate in three principal operating segments on the basis of products and services offered and markets served flow control  motion control  and metal treatment 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further segment financial information

sales flow control motion control metal treatment total curtiss wright operating income flow control motion control metal treatment total segments corporate other n a total curtiss wright operating margins flow control motion control metal treatment total segments total curtiss wright page flow control our flow control segment reported sales of million for  a increase over sales of million 
the sales increase was achieved through organic sales growth of and full year sales contribution of our acquisitions of nova machine  trentec  groquip  and epd  which contributed million in incremental revenue 
the organic growth in sales was driven by higher sales to the oil and gas industry of million and higher product sales and development work to the defense market of million 
coker valve products accounted for approximately of the increased oil and gas market sales due to greater customer acceptance and increased installations  while our other oil and gas valve and field service revenues were higher because of increased maintenance expenditures by refineries worldwide 
higher valve sales to the us navy of million were driven by strong demand for our jp jet fuel transfer valves and ball valves used on nimitz class aircraft carriers and virginia class submarines  respectively 
electronic instrumentation and digital signal processing card sales on naval platforms increased million as compared to the prior year 
these increased sales to the us navy were partially offset by anticipated lower revenues from electromechanical products because of timing of major programs 
revenues from pump production decreased million compared to the prior year due to completion of los angeles and virginia class submarine production pump contracts and development prototype programs  such as for the cvn aircraft carrier  and were partially offset by sales for development work on the us army s electromagnetic gun  which increased million  and sales of generators which increased million 
in addition  foreign currency translation favorably impacted this segment s sales by million in compared to operating income for was million  an increase of over operating income of million 
the base business operating income grew organically for the full year ended december   while the acquisitions contributed an additional million of incremental operating income in the improvement in operating income of base businesses was driven primarily by higher sales volume 
factors impacting the comparison of the base businesses to the prior year include increased sales and margins from our oil and gas products  notably record orders for our coker valves and the higher margin field service and repairs business 
in addition  the operating income benefit from the higher overall volume to the us navy was partially offset by unfavorable mix within our electronic products and lower margin development work performed in anticipation of follow on production orders with the us army 
higher raw material costs  such as the cost of steel  and higher administrative infrastructure costs have adversely impacted our operating margins 
in addition  foreign currency translation favorably impacted operating income by million in as compared to backlog at december  is million compared with million at december  and million at december  new orders received in totaled million  which represents a increase over new orders of million and a increase over new orders received in the increase is mainly due to our new acquisitions  which accounted for million in incremental new orders during record new orders for our coker valve products to the oil and gas industry were offset by lower funding received from the us navy for our electromechanical products in compared to our flow control segment reported sales of million for  a increase over sales of million 
the higher sales were primarily due to the contributions of our acquisitions of nova machine  trentec  groquip  and epd 
the incremental sales from these acquisitions amounted to million 
the remaining business units of this segment produced organic sales growth of 
the solid organic growth was lead by stronger sales of valves  pumps  other electro mechanical products  and field services to the power generation market  which increased million due to additional orders  new teaming arrangements  and expedited plant outage service requirements 
increased demand helped drive record new orders of our coker valves for the oil and gas industry  which positively impacted sales by million  and higher sales of our electronic products to the us navy  which increased million and also contributed to the organic growth 
this increase was partially offset by lower sales of flow control products to the us navy of million due to the timing of contractual revenues 
in  the flow control segment completed the shipment of two large projects to the us navy  which generated approximately million in sales 
we were able to partially offset the impact of these completed naval projects with higher sales of pumps and other generators for aircraft carriers and submarines and increased demand for the non nuclear ball valves to the us navy 
sales of the remaining valve product lines to the oil and gas industry were down in compared to the prior year 
in addition  foreign currency translation favorably impacted sales by million in compared to page operating income in increased by over the increase was mainly due to solid organic growth of and the contributions from the acquisitions  which generated operating income of million in the increase in organic operating income was mainly due to contract cost overruns on a safety relief valve project and inventory write offs of approximately million in that did not reoccur in  higher volume and a stronger sales mix within our power generation products  and higher overall volumes for our valve products to the oil and gas industry and electronic products to the us navy 
the increase was partially offset by the lower volume to the us navy  driven by the profit impact related to the two large higher margin contracts in that did not reoccur in these projects contributed approximately million in operating income in foreign currency translation had a million positive impact on operating income compared to motion control our motion control segment reported sales of million for  a increase over sales of million 
the higher sales largely reflect the contributions of our acquisition of indal  and the full year contributions of our acquisitions of dy  synergy  and primagraphics 
the incremental sales associated with these acquisitions amounted to million 
organic sales increased 
sales in the base business were driven by several factors  including a million increase in commercial aerospace oem market sales 
commercial aerospace oem sales were driven largely by increased demand for our actuation systems content on the boeing platform and increased sales of sensors and components 
commercial aerospace aftermarket sales increased million during the period  with million of that increase in our repair and overhaul business  driven by improving conditions in the commercial airline industry  while spares sales contributed an additional million 
the remaining change in our commercial markets was highlighted by million of higher controller product sales for use in general industrial applications  which was partially offset by the expiration of a tilting train drive systems project in europe  which contributed million in sales in we also experienced a million sales increase in the defense aerospace market  driven by production work on the new an apr radar warning system for use on various helicopter programs  along with strong sales increases in ruggedized embedded computing 
remaining sales to the military aerospace market were essentially flat as increased ship set production of our actuation systems on the f aircraft were offset by lower sales of f spares 
sales to the ground defense market were up million  as higher turret drive stabilization systems and mobile gun systems sales were largely offset by lower spares sales for the bradley fighting vehicle 
in addition  foreign currency translation negatively impacted sales by million in as compared to operating income for increased million  or over operating income in our base businesses increased driven primarily by higher sales volume and related improvements in gross margin 
the operating margins in decreased basis points to 
factors impacting the comparison of the base businesses to the prior year include increased sales and margins from commercial aerospace programs  notably the boeing and programs  and favorable industry trends in the markets for commercial aftermarket services and spares leading to higher sales and margins  and cost reduction initiatives 
offsetting these increases are the completion of a tilting train drive systems project in europe and lower f spares orders  both high margin products that contributed favorably in the prior year  continuing integration efforts in the embedded computing business  and lower margins associated with development work performed in anticipation of follow on production orders  the bulk of which related to cost overruns on a fixed price contract for the tanker refueling program 
the operating margin associated with businesses acquired in and was  significantly lower than the base businesses  however  we expect our integration efforts will improve these margins in the future 
in the current year  our newly acquired businesses operating income was impacted by the delay of orders for our naval systems products  which was anticipated to be realized in  the ongoing integration efforts in the embedded computing business  and margin erosion from changes in foreign exchange rates on certain foreign currency denominated contracts for similar products 
backlog at december  was million compared with million at december  and million at december  acquisitions made during represent million of the backlog at december  new orders received in totaled million  which represents a increase over new orders of million and a increase over new orders received in the increase is mainly due to strong orders for our mechanical actuator and embedded computing products 
the segment s and acquisitions accounted for million in incremental new orders in versus page motion control segment sales in were million  a increase over sales of million 
the higher sales largely reflect the contributions of our acquisitions of dy  primagraphics  and synergy  and the full year contributions of our december acquisitions of systran  novatronics  and pickering 
the incremental sales associated with these acquisitions amounted to million 
sales from the remaining base businesses grew organically 
improvement in commercial aerospace aftermarket sales contributed million to the growth  million of which came from our repair and overhaul business  with the remainder attributable mainly to increased sensors and controls sales 
drive system sales to the european ground defense market declined by million as expedited customer delivery requirements shifted production from the beginning of into domestic electro mechanical systems production experienced a slight increase in domestic military aerospace sales  with f production and spares revenue replacing f spares sales  which had ramped up at the end of the base embedded computing businesses were essentially flat  with increased sales to the domestic military aerospace market of million driven by new contract wins including the start of full scale production of radar warning systems for the us army s helicopter programs and the design  development  and integration of the actuators for the refueling program 
these wins were offset by declines to the domestic ground defense market of million  mainly from scheduled production declines on the abrams tank and the bradley fighting vehicle  while bradley spares revenue remained strong through due to the support of the iraqi war effort 
additionally  foreign currency translation favorably impacted sales in by million compared to operating income for this segment in increased over acquisitions made in and generated incremental operating income of million  while the base businesses increased 
the improvement was driven by the higher sales volume  favorable sales mix from commercial aerospace aftermarket services and spares  and implemented cost control initiatives  offset by lower margin development work performed in anticipation of follow on production orders 
the segment benefited from reductions in reserve requirements at its european sensors business totaling million during  resulting in a million variance in a year over year comparison  since the majority of the reserves were recorded in foreign currency translation had a million positive impact on operating income compared to metal treatment our metal treatment segment reported sales of million in  an increase of over sales of million 
organic sales growth of contributed million to the increase 
the organic growth was due to solid performance in our global shot peening services  which contributed million of additional sales mainly in the european commercial aerospace and global automotive markets 
increases in shot peen forming services  primarily on wing components on the airbus family of aircraft including the a  and shot peening services on aircraft engines were both driven by customer production requirements 
sales of shot peening services for the automotive industry increased in both europe and north america by million and million  respectively  due to favorable overlap of existing and new programs in the first half of the year  partially offset by decreased volumes from general motors and ford in the second half of the year 
sale of our heat treating and coatings divisions were up million and million  respectively  over the prior year period 
the increases were derived primarily from the commercial aerospace market  as customer demand for these services on aircraft component parts increased with the continuing recovery of the aerospace market 
in  laser peening sales were essentially flat compared to  as we continue to develop applications for this new technology to be used on highly stressed critical components in the turbine engine  aircraft structures  medical implant  and oil and gas markets 
the remaining sales increase was due to contributions from our acquisitions  which contributed million of incremental sales during foreign currency translation had a nominal positive impact on sales in compared to operating income for increased to million from million during  mainly due to higher sales volume 
gross margins improved slightly on the higher sales volume  partially offset by higher energy costs of million  primarily in our heat treating division 
however  the impact of the greater sales volume was felt most significantly on operating income  which had margins of in compared to in selling  general  and administrative costs  which are generally fixed in nature  increased only over the prior year period  contributing to the higher operating income margin percentage 
foreign currency translation had a nominal negative impact on operating income in compared to page backlog at december  and was million compared with million at december  new orders received in totaled million  which represents an increase from new orders of million and a increase over new orders received in the increase is mainly due to the improvement in the global economy  which positively impacted the core shot peening business and the segment s recent acquisitions 
metal treatment sales were million in  an increase of over sales of million 
organic sales growth of contributed million to the increase 
the organic growth was due to strong sales growth from our new laser peening technology  which contributed million in incremental sales  as well as solid growth in our global shot peening services  which contributed million of incremental sales mainly in the german automotive  european commercial aerospace  and north american commercial and military aerospace markets 
sales from our heat treating division were up million over the prior year period mainly due to overflow from a competitor and to the segment s new aluminum treatment capabilities for the aerospace industry 
the remaining sales increase came from our and acquisitions  which contributed million of incremental sales during the main contributor to this increase was our e m engineered coatings solutions businesses  which were acquired in april in addition  foreign currency translation favorably impacted sales by million compared to operating income for increased to million from million during margin improvement was due to higher sales volume  favorable sales mix due to higher laser peening sales  and implemented cost reduction initiatives 
offsetting our margin improvements were increased medical costs and higher energy costs as compared to the prior year period 
foreign currency translation had a million positive impact on operating income as compared to corporate and other expenses non segment operating costs consist mainly of environmental remediation and administrative expenses  pension expense income associated with the curtiss wright pension plan  and other income and expense not directly associated with the ongoing performance of the segments 
we had non segment operating costs of million  million and million in   and  respectively 
environmental remediation and administration costs represented million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
the increase in was due to a million increase in remediation reserve requirements related to the caldwell trucking landfill superfund site 
pension expense associated with the curtiss wright pension plan was million and million in and  respectively  while experienced income of million 
the increase in pension expense is due to increased service costs and lower returns on plan assets 
we also realized a gain of million during on the sale of a former operating property located in fairfield  new jersey 
higher consulting fees associated with sarbanes oxley section compliance in and accounted for the remaining difference as compared to interest expense interest expense increased million in compared to higher interest rates accounted for approximately of the increase  and the remaining increase was due to higher debt levels associated with the funding of our acquisitions 
interest expense in increased million from  with higher debt levels associated with the funding of our acquisitions accounting for of the increase 
the remaining increase in versus was caused by higher interest rates 
provision for income taxes our effective tax rates for   and are   and  respectively 
our effective tax rate included a charge of million from the repatriation of foreign earnings under the american jobs creation act of our effective tax rate included nonrecurring benefits totaling million resulting primarily from the change in legal structure of one of our subsidiaries and a favorable irs appeals settlement 
our effective tax rate included the benefit of the restructuring of some of our european operations 
page liquidity and capital resources sources and uses of cash we derive the majority of our operating cash inflow from receipts on the sale of goods and services and cash outflow for the procurement of materials and labor and cash flow is therefore subject to market fluctuations and conditions 
a substantial portion of our business is in the defense sector  which is characterized by long term contracts 
most of our long term contracts allow for several billing points progress or milestone that provide us with cash receipts as costs are incurred throughout the project rather than upon contract completion  thereby reducing working capital requirements 
in some cases  these payments can exceed the costs incurred on a project 
operating activities our working capital was million at december   an increase of million from the working capital at december  of million 
our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was to at december   compared with a ratio of to at december  cash and cash equivalents totaled in the aggregate at december   up from million at december  the increase is primarily due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents following the senior note offering and subsequent pay down of our outstanding debt under our revolving credit facilities 
excluding the impact on cash  working capital increased million partially due to our indal acquisition made in the first quarter of the remainder of the increase was driven mainly by increases in inventory of million and accounts receivables of million 
inventory balances rose primarily as a result of build up for expected increases in sales in and strategic initiatives to lower turn around time for deliveries 
accounts receivable increased due to the timing of contractual billings and industry cycles  partially offset by collection of receivables from certain large projects outstanding at december  unbilled receivables increased substantially due to funding and other operational delays by certain customers as well as increased contracts for which progress billings do not apply 
partially offsetting these increases in working capital requirements was an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses associated with the build up of inventories and higher accrued compensation 
our short term debt was million at december  and million at december  our long term debt was million at december   an increase of million from the balance at december  the increase in long term debt is primarily due to funds borrowed to purchase indal offset by cash generation during days sales outstanding at december  decreased to days from days at december  while inventory turnover decreased to turns at december  as compared to turns at december  our balance of cash and cash equivalents totaled million at december   down from million at december  the decrease was primarily due to the use of available cash to fund our acquisition of dy systems  inc on january  excluding the impact on cash  working capital increased million due to our acquiring eleven businesses in in addition to the impact of these acquisitions  working capital changes were highlighted by an increase in receivables of million and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million 
unbilled receivables increased substantially due to funding and other operational delays by certain customers as well as increased contracts for which progress billings do not apply 
the increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses is due to the timing of year end payments and higher accrued compensation 
our short term debt was million at december  and million at december  our long term debt was million at december   an increase of million from the balance at december  the increase in long term debt was the result of additional funds borrowed to acquire eleven businesses in days sales outstanding at december  decreased to days from days at december  while inventory turnover increased to turns at december  as compared to turns at december  investing activities we have acquired twenty five businesses since and expect to continue to seek acquisitions that are consistent with our long term growth strategy 
a combination of cash resources  funds available under our credit agreement  and proceeds from our senior notes were utilized to fund our acquisitions  which totaled million and million in and  respectively 
as indicated in note to the consolidated financial statements  some of our acquisition agreements contain purchase price adjustments  such as potential earn out payments and working capital adjustments 
during  we made approximately million in such payments relative to prior period acquisitions 
additional acquisitions will depend  in part  on the availability of financial resources at a cost of capital that meets our stringent criteria 
as such  future acquisitions  if any  may be funded through the use of our cash and cash page equivalents  through additional financing available under the credit agreement  or through new financing alternatives 
our capital expenditures were million in  million in  and million in in and  principal capital expenditures included a move to a new flow control facility  new and replacement machinery and equipment within the business segments and for the expansion of new product lines and facilities 
our capital expenditures in included building expansions  a new laser peening facility and associated laser machinery  and various other machinery and equipment 
financing activities on december   we issued million of senior series notes the notes 
our notes mature on december  and are senior unsecured obligations  equal in right of payment to our existing senior indebtedness 
we  at our option  can prepay at any time all or any part of our notes  subject to a make whole payment in accordance with the terms of the note purchase agreement 
in connection with our notes  we paid customary fees that have been deferred and will be amortized over the term of our notes 
we are required under the note purchase agreement to maintain certain financial ratios  the most restrictive of which is a debt to capitalization limit of  and a cross default provision with our other senior indebtedness 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants 
in november  we unwound our interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts of million and million which were originally put in place to convert a portion of our fixed interest on the million senior notes and million senior notes  respectively  to variable rates based on specified spreads over six month libor 
the unwinding of these swap agreements resulted in a net loss of million  which has been deferred and is being amortized over the remaining term of the underlying debt 
at december   we had a million revolving credit agreement the agreement with a group of ten banks 
the agreement expires in borrowings under the agreement bear interest at a floating rate based on market conditions 
in addition  our interest rate and level of facility fees are dependent on certain financial ratio levels  as defined in the agreement 
we are subject to annual facility fees on the commitments under the agreement 
in connection with the agreement  we paid customary transaction fees that have been deferred and are being amortized over the term of the agreement 
we are required under the agreement to maintain certain financial ratios and meet certain financial tests  the most restrictive of which is a debt to capitalization limit of and a cross default provision with our other senior indebtedness 
the agreement does not contain any subjective acceleration clauses 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants and had the flexibility to issue additional debt of approximately million without exceeding the covenant limit defined in the agreement 
we would consider other financing alternatives to maintain capital structure balance and ensure compliance with all debt covenants 
we did not have any cash borrowings outstanding excluding letters of credit under the agreement at december  compared to million of cash borrowings outstanding at december  the unused credit available under the agreement at december  was million 
on september  we issued million of senior notes the notes 
the notes consist of million of senior notes that mature on september  and million of senior notes that mature on september  our notes are senior unsecured obligations and are equal in right of payment to our existing senior indebtedness 
we  at our option  can prepay at any time all or any part of our notes  subject to a make whole payment in accordance with the terms of the note purchase agreement 
in connection with our notes  we paid customary fees that have been deferred and will be amortized over the terms of the notes

as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants 
our industrial revenue bonds  which are collateralized by real estate  were million at december  and million at december  the loans outstanding under the and notes  interest rate swaps  revolving credit agreement  and industrial revenue bonds had variable interest rates averaging for and for page future commitments cash generated from operations is considered adequate to meet our operating cash requirements for the upcoming year  including planned capital expenditures of approximately million  interest payments of approximately million to million  estimated income tax payments of approximately million to million  dividends of approximately million  pension funding of approximately million  and additional working capital requirements 
we have approximately million in short term environmental liabilities  which is management s estimation of cash requirements for additionally  we are committed to potential earn out payments on seven of our acquisitions dating back to  which are estimated to be between approximately million to million in there can be no assurance  however  that we will continue to generate cash flow at the current level 
if cash generated from operations is not sufficient to support these requirements and investing activities  we may be required to reduce capital expenditures  refinance a portion of our existing debt  or obtain additional financing 
in  our capital expenditures are expected to be approximately million due to the construction of new facilities  expansion of facilities to accommodate new product lines  and new machinery and equipment  such as additional investment in our laser peening technology 
the following table quantifies our significant future contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  in thousands total thereafter debt principal repayments interest payments on fixed rate debt operating leases total amounts exclude a million adjustment to the fair value of long term debt relating to the corporation s interest rate swap agreements that were settled in cash during we do not have material purchase obligations 
most of our raw material purchase commitments are made directly pursuant to specific contract requirements 
we enter into standby letters of credit agreements with financial institutions and customers primarily relating to guarantees of repayment on our industrial revenue bonds  future performance on certain contracts to provide products and services  and to secure advance payments we have received from certain international customers 
at december   we had contingent liabilities on outstanding letters of credit due as follows in thousands total thereafter letters of credit critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america 
preparing consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are affected by the application of our accounting policies 
critical accounting policies are those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
we believe that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of our accounting policies that affect our financial condition and results of operations page revenue recognition the realization of revenue refers to the timing of its recognition in our accounts and is generally considered realized or realizable and earned when the earnings process is substantially complete and all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  our price to our customer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we record sales and related profits on production and service type contracts as units are shipped and title and risk of loss have transferred or as services are rendered 
this method is used in our metal treatment segment and in some of the business units within the motion control and flow control segments that serve non military markets 
for certain contracts in our flow control and motion control segments that require performance over an extended period before deliveries begin  sales and estimated profits are recorded by applying the percentage of completion method of accounting 
the percentage of completion method of accounting is used primarily for our defense contracts and certain long term commercial contracts 
this method recognizes revenue and profit as the contracts progress towards completion 
for certain contracts that contain a significant number of performance milestones  as defined by the customer  sales are recorded based upon achievement of these performance milestones 
the performance milestone method is an output measure of progress towards completion made in terms of results achieved 
for certain fixed price contracts  where none or a limited number of milestones exist  the cost to cost method is used  which is an input measure of progress toward completion 
under the cost to cost input method  sales and profits are recorded based on the ratio of costs incurred to an estimate of costs at completion 
under our percentage of completion methods of accounting  a single estimated total profit margin is used to recognize profit for each contract over its entire period of performance 
application of percentage of completion methods of revenue recognition requires the use of reasonable and dependable estimates of the future material  labor  and overhead costs that will be incurred and a disciplined cost estimating system in which all functions of the business are integrally involved 
these estimates are determined based upon industry knowledge and experience of our engineers  project managers  and financial staff 
these estimates are significant and reflect changes in cost and operating performance throughout the contract and could have a significant impact on our operating performance 
adjustments to original estimates for contract revenue  estimated costs at completion  and the estimated total profit are often required as work progresses throughout the contract and as experience and more information is obtained  even though the scope of work under the contract may not change 
these changes are recorded on a cumulative basis in the period they are determined to be necessary 
under the percentage of completion method of accounting  provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are recognized in the period in which the likelihood of such losses are determined 
amounts representing contract change orders are included in revenue only when they can be estimated reliably and their realization is reasonably assured 
certain contracts contain provisions for the redetermination of price and  as such  management defers a portion of the revenue from those contracts until such time as the price has been finalized 
some of our customers withhold certain amounts from the billings they receive 
these retainages are generally not due until the project has been completed and accepted by the customer 
inventory inventory costs include materials  direct labor  and manufacturing overhead costs  which are stated at the lower of cost or market  where market is limited to the net realizable value 
we estimate the net realizable value of our inventories and establish reserves to reduce the carrying amount of these inventories to net realizable value  as necessary 
we continually evaluate the adequacy of the inventory reserves by reviewing historical scrap rates  on hand quantities  as compared with historical and projected usage levels and other anticipated contractual requirements 
the stated inventory costs are also reflective of the estimates used in applying the percentage of completion revenue recognition method 
we purchase materials for the manufacture of components for sale 
the decision to purchase a set quantity of a particular item is influenced by several factors including current and projected price  future estimated availability  existing and projected contracts to produce certain items  and the estimated needs for our businesses 
page for certain of our long term contracts  we utilize progress billings  which represent amounts billed to customers prior to the delivery of goods and services and are recorded as a reduction to inventory and receivables 
progress billings are generally based on costs incurred  including direct costs  overhead  and general and administrative costs 
pension and other postretirement benefits we  in consultation with our actuaries  determine the appropriate assumptions for use in determining the liability for future pension and other postretirement benefits 
the most significant of these assumptions include the number of employees who will receive benefits along with the tenure and salary level of those employees  the expected return on plan assets  the discount rates used to determine plan obligations  and the trends in the costs of medical and other health care benefits in the case of the postretirement benefit obligations 
changes in these assumptions  if significant in future years  may have an effect on our pension and postretirement expense  associated pension and postretirement assets and liabilities  and our annual cash requirements to fund these plans 
the discount rate used to determine the benefit obligations of the plans as of december  and the annual periodic costs for was lowered in to for both the emd and curtiss wright pension plans and the emd postretirement benefit plan to better reflect current economic conditions 
the rate was based on current and future economic indicators 
the reduction in the discount rate increased the benefit obligation of the plans 
a quarter of one percentage point decrease in the discount rate would have the effect of increasing the annual pension expense by million and the pension benefit obligation by million 
we also updated the mortality tables for the pension and postretirement benefit plans to the rp mortality table to better reflect the general improvements in mortality experienced over the past years 
this change caused an additional increase to the benefit obligation 
the overall expected return on assets assumption is based on a combination of historical performance of the pension fund and expectations of future performance 
the historical returns are determined using the market related value of assets  which is the same value used in the calculation of annual net periodic benefit cost 
the market related value of assets includes the recognition of realized and unrealized gains and losses over a five year period  which effectively averages the volatility associated with the actual performance of the plan s assets from year to year 
although over the last ten years the market related value of assets had an average annual yield of  the actual returns averaged during the same period 
we have consistently used the rate as a long term overall average return 
given the uncertainties of the current economic and geopolitical landscapes  we consider the rate to be a reasonable assumption of the future long term investment returns 
a quarter of one percentage point decrease in the expected return on assets would have the effect of increasing our annual pension expense by million 
the long term medical trend assumptions start with a current rate that is in line with expectations for the near future  and then grades the rates down over time until it reaches an ultimate rate that is close to expectations for growth in gdp 
the reasoning is that medical trends cannot continue to be higher than the rate of gdp growth in the long term 
any change in the expectation of these rates to return to a normal level should have an impact on the amount of expense we recognize 
the timing and amount of future pension income or expense to be recognized each year is dependent on the demographics and expected earnings of the plan participants  the expected interest rates in effect in future years  and the actual and expected investment returns of the assets in the pension trust 
see note for further information on our pension and postretirement plans  including an estimate of future cash contributions 
environmental reserves we provide for environmental reserves on a site by site basis when  in conjunction with internal and external legal counsel  it is determined that a liability is both probable and estimable 
in many cases  the liability is not fixed or capped when we first record a liability for a particular site 
if only a range of potential liability can be estimated and no amount within the range is more probable than another  a reserve will be established at the low end of that range 
at sites involving multiple parties  we accrue environmental liabilities based upon our expected share of the liability  taking into account the financial viability of our other jointly liable partners 
judgment is required when we make assumptions and estimate costs expected to be incurred for environmental remediation activities due to  among other factors  difficulties in assessing the extent and type of environmental remediation to be performed  the impact page of complex environmental regulations and remediation technologies  and agreements between potentially responsible parties to share in the cost of remediation 
in estimating the future liability and continually evaluating the sufficiency of such liabilities  we weigh certain factors including our participation percentage due to a settlement by or bankruptcy of other potentially responsible parties  a change in the environmental laws requiring more stringent requirements  an increase or decrease in the estimated time required to remediate  a change in the estimate of future costs that will be incurred to remediate the site  and changes in technology related to environmental remediation 
we do not believe that continued compliance with environmental laws applicable to our operations will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operation 
however  given the level of judgment and estimation used in the recording of environmental reserves  it is reasonably possible that materially different amounts could be recorded if different assumptions were used or if circumstances were to change  such as environmental regulations or remediation solution remedies 
as of december   our environmental reserves totaled million  the majority of which is long term 
approximately of the environmental reserves represent the current value of our anticipated remediation costs and are not discounted primarily due to the uncertainty of timing of expenditures 
the remaining environmental reserves are discounted to reflect the time value of money since the amount and timing of cash payments for the liability are reasonably determinable 
we use a discount rate of  which approximates an amount at which the environmental liability could be settled in an arm s length transaction with a third party 
all environmental reserves exclude any potential recovery from insurance carriers or third party legal actions 
purchase accounting we apply the purchase method of accounting to our acquisitions 
under this method  the purchase price  including any capitalized acquisition costs  is allocated to the underlying tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair market values  with any excess recorded as goodwill 
we determine the fair values of such assets and liabilities  generally in consultation with third party valuation advisors 
the fair value of assets acquired net of cash and liabilities assumed of our one acquisition were estimated to be million and million  respectively 
the initial fair value assigned to this acquisition is preliminary and may be revised prior to finalization  which is to be completed within a reasonable period  generally within one year of acquisition 
goodwill we have million in goodwill as of december  the recoverability of goodwill is subject to an annual impairment test based on the estimated fair value of the underlying businesses 
additionally  goodwill is tested for impairment when an event occurs or if circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
these estimated fair values are based on estimates of future cash flows of the businesses 
factors affecting these future cash flows include the continued market acceptance of the products and services offered by the businesses  the development of new products and services by the businesses and the underlying cost of development  the future cost structure of the businesses  and future technological changes 
estimates are also used for the corporation s cost of capital in discounting the projected future cash flows 
if it has been determined that impairment has occurred  we may be required to recognize an impairment of our asset  which would be limited to the difference between the book value of the asset and its fair value 
any such impairment would be recognized in full in the reporting period in which it has been identified 
other intangible assets other intangible assets are generally the result of acquisitions and consist primarily of purchased technology  customer related intangibles  trademarks and service marks  and technology licenses 
intangible assets are recorded at their fair values as determined through purchase accounting 
definite lived intangible assets are amortized ratably to match their cash flow streams over their estimated useful lives  which range from to years  while indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized 
indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually based on the discounted future cash flows 
additionally  we review the recoverability of all intangible assets  including the related useful lives  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount might not be recoverable 
we would record any impairment in the reporting period in which it has been identified 
page recently issued accounting standards in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
fas 
this statement requires that a voluntary change in accounting principle be applied retrospectively with all prior period financial statements presented on the basis of the new accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to do so 
fas also provides that a change in method of depreciating or amortizing a long lived nonfinancial asset be accounted for as a change in estimate prospectively that was effected by a change in accounting principle  and correction of errors in previously issued financial statements should be termed a restatement 
the new standard is effective for accounting changes and correction of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption of this standard is permitted for accounting changes and correction of errors made in fiscal years beginning after june  we do not anticipate that the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on our results of operation or financial condition

revised  accounting for stock based compensation fas r 
this statement requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award with limited exceptions 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award the requisite service period usually the vesting period 
no compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render the requisite service 
employee share purchase plans will not result in recognition of compensation cost if certain conditions are met  those conditions are much the same as the related conditions in fas this statement is effective as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  on april  the sec announced a deferral of the effective date of fas r for calendar year companies until january  we expect the adoption of this statement to have a pre tax expense of approximately million on operating income in in march of  the fasb issued fin no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fas 
this interpretation clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in fas  accounting for asset retirement obligations  refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing and or method of settlement 
thus  the timing and or method of settlement may be conditional on a future event 
accordingly  an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
the fair value of a liability for the conditional asset retirement obligation should be recognized when incurred generally upon acquisition  construction  or development and or through the normal operation of the asset 
uncertainty about the timing and or method of settlement of a conditional asset retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists 
fas acknowledges that in some cases  sufficient information may not be available to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
this interpretation also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
the adoption of this interpretation did not have a material impact on our results of operation or financial condition

page item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our global operating and financing activities 
we seek to minimize any material risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations through our normal operating and financing activities and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
we do not use such instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
we used interest rate swaps and forward foreign currency contracts to manage our interest rate and currency rate exposures during the year ended december  we unwound our interest rate swaps in november information regarding our accounting policy on financial instruments is contained in note k to the consolidated financial statements 
the market risk for a change in interest rates relates primarily to our debt obligations 
we shifted our interest rate exposure from variable at december  to fixed at december  the net proceeds of the new million notes offering principally contributed to our ability to pay down our outstanding debt under our revolving credit facility at december  the variable rates on the industrial revenue bonds are based on market rates 
a change in interest rates of would have an impact on consolidated interest expense of approximately million 
information regarding our and notes  revolving credit agreement  and interest rates swaps is contained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
financial instruments expose us to counter party credit risk for non performance and to market risk for changes in interest and foreign currency rates 
we manage exposure to counter party credit risk through specific minimum credit standards  diversification of counter parties  and procedures to monitor concentrations of credit risk 
we monitor the impact of market risk on the fair value and cash flows of our investments by investing primarily in investment grade interest bearing securities  which have short term maturities 
we attempt to minimize possible changes in interest and currency exchange rates to amounts that are not material to our consolidated results of operations and cash flows 
our acquisitions of indal  dy and novatronics have increased our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations related primarily to the canadian dollar 
we currently have a hedging program in place to mitigate the canadian dollar foreign currency risk 
although the majority of our sales  expenses  and cash flows are transacted in us dollars  we do have some market risk exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  primarily as it relates to the value of the us dollar versus the canadian dollar  the british pound  the euro  and the swiss franc 
any significant change in the value of the currencies of those countries in which we do business against the us dollar could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we seek to minimize the risk from these foreign currency fluctuations principally through invoicing our customers in the same currency as the functional currency of the revenue producing entity 
however  our efforts to minimize these risks may not be successful 
if foreign exchange rates were to collectively weaken or strengthen against the dollar by  net earnings would have been reduced or increased  respectively  by approximately million as it relates exclusively to foreign currency exchange rate exposures
