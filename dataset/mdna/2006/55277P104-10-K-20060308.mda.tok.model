mge also made capital contributions to atc totaling million 
dividend income received from atc for the year ended december   was million  compared to million for the same period in the prior year 
these increases are offset by a decrease in capital expenditures related to mge utility plant in the amount of million  a decrease in the advance made to atc related to wccf million  proceeds from the sale of property million  and a decrease in cash used for other investing activities million 
capital expenditures the following table shows mge energy s estimated capital expenditures for  actual for  and the three year average for to in thousands for the years ended december estimated actual three year average to electric production distribution and general total electric gas common utility plant total nonregulated mge energy total mge energy s and mge s liquidity are primarily affected by their construction requirements 
we allocate common plant for the financial statements and footnotes based on a prescribed formula electric and gas 
mge energy s major capital projects include wccf and elm road 
during  million in capital additions were made for the construction of wccf 
this amount includes million of interest capitalized in accordance with the provisions set forth in sfas no 
 capitalization of interest cost 
additionally  million in capital additions were made for the construction of elm road 
this amount includes million in capitalized interest 
mge energy used funds received as dividend payments from mge as well as short and long term external financing to meet its capital requirements and cash obligations  including dividend payments 
external financing included short term financing under existing lines of credit 
while dividends from mge will remain a significant source for the cash needs of mge energy  lease revenues from the wccf will supplement those dividends 
during  atc solicited its investors for and voluntary capital contributions 
in response to this request  mge transco made a million voluntary capital contribution on october  atc has requested an additional million in voluntary contributions for mge transco has not formally committed to make these contributions  however it is likely that mge transco will agree to do so 
during january  a million capital contribution was made by mge transco to atc in response to this request 
financing activities and capitalization matters mge energy vs 
cash provided by mge energy s financing activities was million for  compared to million for on october   mge energy  through its wholly owned subsidiary mge power west campus  issued million of senior secured notes due september  for the year ended december   net short term debt borrowings were million 
proceeds from stock issued under the stock plan were million 
these cash in flows were offset by cash dividends paid of million and other financing cash uses of million 
the cash dividends for were higher than those paid in as result of higher dividend per share vs 
and an increase in the number of shares outstanding 
additionally  as of march  shares to satisfy the stock plan were purchased on the open market  rather than through the issuance of new shares 
the aforemention ed change resulted in million balance for the purchase of treasury stock 
during  proceeds from the issuance of common stock were million 
this cash inflow is largely attributable to the equity issuance completed september  proceeds received under this issuance were primarily utilized to repay short term debt obligations 
additional equity was issued under the distribution agreement through bocm and through the stock plan 
during  mge energy made million in repayments on pre existing long term facilities 
no additional long term debt was issued during however  there was million in net short term debt borrowings 
cash dividends for were million and cash provided by other financing activities was million 
no major equity issuances were completed in shares issued though the stock plan for the year ended december   resulted in net proceeds of million 
as mentioned  in march  mge switched from issuing new shares of common stock for the stock plan to purchasing shares on the open market 
as such  during  equity issuances were not a major source of capital 
vs 
cash provided by mge energy s financing activities was million for  compared to million for this increase is related to an increase in the proceeds from the issuance of common stock and the reduction of long term net borrowings during proceeds from the issuance of common stock increased million for when compared to the prior year 
this increase is a result of the equity issuance completed september  proceeds received under this issuance were primarily utilized to repay short term obligations 
additional equity was issued under the distribution agreement through bocm and through the stock plan 
during and  mge energy made million in repayments on pre existing long term facilities 
no additional long term debt was issued during or there was a million increase in the short term debt balance during and a millio n reduction in the short term debt balance during cash dividends for increased million and cash received from other financing activities increased million compared to the prior year

during  million in equity contributions were received by mge power west campus and mge transco from mge energy 
these amounts are included in minority interest on the mge consolidated balance sheet 
additionally  for the year ended december   million in affiliate financing was received by mge power elm road 
these funds were used to finance the elm road project 
the aforementioned cash inflows were offset by cash dividends paid from mge to mge energy of milli on and cash dividends paid by mge power west campus to mge energy of million 
during  there were also other financing cash uses of million 
dividend payments by mge to mge energy are subject to restrictions arising under a pscw rate order and  to a lesser degree  mge s first mortgage bonds 
the pscw order limits the amount of dividends that mge may pay mge energy when its common equity ratio  calculated in the manner used in the rate proceeding  is less than 
under those circumstances  mge may not pay dividends in excess of million plus dividends on shares issued in excess of the shares issued in the rate proceeding forecast if the proceeds are invested in mge 
mge s common equity ratio at december   is estimated to be as determined under the calculation used in the rate proceeding 
the rate proceeding calculation includes as indebtedness imputed amounts for mge s outstanding purchase power capacity payments and other pscw adjustments  but does not include the indebtedness associated with mge power west campus  which is consolidat ed in accordance with fin r into mge s financial statements 
in addition  mge has covenanted with the holders of its first mortgage bonds not to declare or pay any dividend or make any other distribution on or purchase any shares of its common stock unless  after giving effect thereto  the aggregate amount of all such dividends and distributions and all amounts applied to such purchases  after december   shall not exceed the earned surplus retained earnings accumulated subsequent to december  as of december   approximately million was available for the payment of dividends under this covenant

business and regulatory environment electric transmission atc on january   mge transferred substantially all of its electric transmission facilities to atc in exchange for an interest in this joint venture 
at december   mge transco has a ownership interest in atc 
atc is comprised of wisconsin investor owned utilities and some wisconsin municipal utilities  cooperatives  and power supply agencies 
the pscw authorized an electric rate surcharge of million  or  over a twelve month period ended october   for mge to recover deferred costs associated with atc s formation and ongoing incremental transmission costs during and on november   mge and atc entered into an interconnection agreement related to transmission system upgrades for wccf 
mge issued to atc a notice to proceed for the procurement of the equipment for the system upgrades 
mge advanced a total of million in funds for construction of transmission equipment and work done by atc related to wccf 
these funds and the interest incurred by atc were collected by mge during wepco and atc entered into an interconnection agreement related to transmission system upgrades for elm road  of which mge power elm road has an undivided ownership interest in 
at december   mge advanced elm road services  llc million in funds for construction of transmission equipment and work done by atc related to elm road 
mge will be reimbursed for all previously advanced funds upon completion of the project

wind power purchase agreement on july   mge signed a year power purchase agreement for mw of wind energy to be located near waupun  wisconsin 
construction has not begun on this project  and discussions are currently on going related to its viability 
as a result  no final decisions or financial commitments have been made 
blount generating station on january   mge announced a plan subject to certain conditions  that includes discontinuing coal use at the end of at blount 
the plant is capable of burning coal and natural gas 
the plant will continue to run on natural gas but will be reduced from its current approximate mw capacity to mw when coal burning is discontinued 
mge anticipates full regulatory recovery of the costs associated with the discontinuance of coal at blount 
nonregulated energy outlook wccf mge energy  through mge power  mge power west campus  and mge construct  has constructed a natural gas fired cogeneration facility on the uw campus 
the facility has the capacity to produce  tons of chilled water   pounds per hour of steam  and approximately mw of electricity 
the uw and mge power west campus jointly own the facility 
the uw owns a controlling interest in the chilled water and steam plants  which are used to meet the uw s growing need for air conditioning and steam heat capacity 
mge power west campus owns a controlling interest in the electric generation plant  which is used to provide electricity to mge s customers 
see nonregulated energy operations under item  business  for additional information regarding the wccf  its construction and the lease arrangement between mge power west campus and mge 
for the year ended december   mge construct received a total service fee of million pretax from the state in relation to its role as epc contractor for wccf 
this amount is classified as revenue from nonregulated operations within mge energy s financial statements 
as of december  the entire million was recognized 
this amount was recognized as services were rendered and was collected over a month period 
on april   acceptance testing for the steam and chilled water portion of the facility began 
on this date  mge began allocating charges to the uw based on the operating agreement 
under the provisions of this arrangement  the uw is required to reimburse mge for their allocated portion of fuel and operating expenses 
these allocations are based on formulas outlined in the operating agreement 
for the year ended december   the state was allocated million in fuel and operating costs 
elm road on november   mge power elm road closed on the exercise of an option to acquire an undivided ownership interest in each of two mw advanced technology  coal fired generating units being constructed by we energies in oak creek  wisconsin 
on that date  mge power elm road also made its initial payment for construction costs 
mge power elm road s estimated share of capital costs for its ownership interest in both units is approximately million  which it intends to finance primarily through funds received from mge energy 
mge energy expects that these funds will be raised through the sale of securities via the stock plan  short term debt  and normal operations 
at december   mge power elm road had incurred million excluding capitalized interest of costs on the project  which is reflected in the construction work in progress balance on mge and mge energy s condensed conso lidated balance sheets 
of this amount  million has not yet been paid 
on this date  mge energy and its subsidiaries entered into various agreements  including a facility lease agreement 
this facility lease agreement is between mge power elm road a nonregulated subsidiary of mge energy and mge 
the financial terms of the facility lease include a capital structure of equity and long term debt  and return on equity of  a lease term of years  and a rent reduction in the first five years 
on november   mge received approval from the pscw to defer payments made to mge power elm road for carrying costs during construction of the facility  management fees  and community impact mitigation costs 
mge will begin collecting the carrying costs in rates in mge estimates total carrying costs to be approximately million 
this amount is expected to be collected over multiple years 
of these costs  million is estimated to relate to the capitalized interest and the debt portion of the facility 
these costs will be recognized over the period in which the facility will be depreciated 
the remaining million is estimated to represent the equity portion and will be recognized over the period recovered in rates 
mge expects to begin collecting the management fees and community impact mitigation costs in rates in these costs are expected to be collected over a four year period 
critical accounting policies mge energy and mge the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to unbilled revenues  pension obligations  income taxes  derivatives  and regulatory assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
unbilled revenues revenues from the sale of electricity and gas to customers are recorded when electricity gas is delivered to those customers 
the quantity of those sales is measured by customers meters 
due to the large volume of those meters  it is impractical to read all of them at month end 
meters are read on a systematic basis throughout the month based on established meter reading schedules 
consequently  at the end of any month  there exists a quantity of electricity and gas that has been delivered to customers but has not been captured by the meter readings 
as a result  management must estimate revenue related to electricity and gas delivered to customers between their meter read dates and the end of the period 
these estimates include the amount of electricity expected to be lost in the process of its transmission and distribution to customers line loss and the amount of electricity actually delivered to customers 
the mix of sales between customer rate classes  which is based upon historical utilization assumptions 
during  many of mge s largest customers were shifted to a calendar month end bill 
as a result of this shift  the majority of these customers electricity usage is now accounted for in the unbilled calculation 
the unbilled amounts for a month are based on actual usage billed the following month 
due to this billing shift and its impact on the unbilled calculation  mge has seen the ratio of unbilled receivables to total electric sales climb 
the ratio has settled into a range of to  and mge will continue to monitor and track this range 
allowance for doubtful accounts mge maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the company determines the allowance based on historical write off experience  regional economic data  and review of the accounts receivable aging 
the company reviews its allowance for doubtful accounts monthly 
although management believes that the allowance for doubtful accounts is the company s best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses  if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
pension plans and postretirement mge provides employees with certain retirement pension and postretirement health care and life insurance benefits 
in order to measure the expense and obligations associated with these benefits  management must make a variety of estimates  including discount rates used to value certain liabilities  the expected return on plan assets set aside to fund these costs  the rate of compensation increase  employee turnover rates  retirement rates  health care trends  mortality rates  and other factors 
these accounting estimates bear the risk of change due to the uncertainty attached to the estimate as well as the fact that these estimates are difficult to measure 
different estimates used by us could result in recognizing different amounts of expense over different periods of time 
we use third party specialists to assist us in evaluating our assumptions as well as appropriately measure the costs and obligations associated with these retirement benefits 
the discount rate and expected return on plan assets are based primarily on investment yields available and the historical performance of our plan assets 
they are critical accounting estimates because they are subject to management s judgment and can materially affect net income 
assumed return on assets 
this assumption represents the rate of return on plan assets reflecting the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation 
for  mge used a assumed return on assets 
one of the approaches mge used in determining its assumed return on assets is based on historical returns 
as of december   the ten year historical return was 
holding other assumptions constant  for every reduction in the expected rate of return on plan assets  annual pension expense would increase by approximately million  before taxes 
discount rate 
the discount rate represents the rate at which pension obligations could effectively be settled on a present value basis 
mge uses high grade bond yields as a benchmark 
medical trend assumptions 
the health care cost trend rate is the assumed rate of increase in per capita health care charges 
the health trend assumption for was reset from to as a result of an expanded relationship with a managed care health provider with a greater emphasis on preventive care  provider discounts and better utilization management 
income tax provision mge energy s and mge s income tax provisions  including both current and deferred components  are based on estimates  assumptions  calculations  and interpretation of tax statutes for the current and future years 
determination of current year federal and state income tax will not be settled for years 
management regularly makes assessments of tax return outcomes relative to financial statement tax provisions and adjusts the tax provisions in the period when facts become final 
additionally  in determining our current income tax provision we assess temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are recorded in our balance sheets 
when we maintain deferred tax assets  we must assess the likelihood that these assets will be recovered through adjustments to future taxable income 
to the extent we believe recovery is more likely than not  we establish a valuation allowance 
we record an allowance reducing the asset to a value we believe will be recoverable based on our expectation of future taxable income 
we believe the accounting estimate related to the valuation allowance is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change from period to period as it requires management to make assumptions about our future income over the lives of the deferred tax assets  and the impac t of increasing or decreasing the valuation allowance is potentially material to our results of operations 
accounting for derivative instruments mge accounts for derivative financial instruments under sfas no 
 accounting for derivatives and hedging activities  and sfas no 
 amendment of sfas no 
on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 all derivatives except those qualifying for the normal purchase normal sale exception are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value 
fair value is determined using current quoted market prices 
if a contract is designated as a cash flow hedge  the change in its market value is generally deferred as a component of other comprehensive income until the transaction it is hedging is completed 
conversely  the change in the market value of a derivative not designated as a cash flow hedge is recorded in current period earnings 
a cash flow hedge is a hedge of a forecasted transaction or the variability of cash flows to be received or pa id related to a recognized asset or liability 
in the third quarter of  mge received approval from the pscw to establish a regulatory asset or liability for the deferral of the effects of mark to market accounting as required by sfas no 
on contracts related to mge s regulated operations 
regulatory assets liabilities regulatory assets represent costs that have been deferred to future periods when it is probable that the regulator will allow future recovery of those costs through rates 
mge bases its assessment of recovery by precedents established by the regulatory body 
regulatory liabilities represent previous collections from customers to fund future expected costs or amounts received in rates that are expected to be refunded to customers in future periods 
these costs typically include deferral of energy costs  the normalization of income taxes  and the deferral of losses incurred on debt retirements 
the accounting for these regulatory assets and liabilities is in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
mge continually assesses whether the regulatory assets meet the criteria for probability of future recovery 
this assessment considers factors such as changes in the regulatory environment  recent rate orders to other regulated entities under the same jurisdiction  and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation 
if future recovery of costs becomes no longer probable  the assets and liabilities would be recognized as current period revenues or expenses 
amortization of regulatory assets is provided over the recovery period as allowed in the related regulatory agreement 
conditional aro as of december   mge adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations fin 
fin clarified that a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a long lived asset whose timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event is within the scope of sfas no 
under fin  mge is required to record a conditional aro at its estimated fair value if that fair value can be reasonably estimated 
as of december   mge had a liability of million associated with its conditional aros 
the adoption of fin required mge to update an existing inventory of aros  originally created for the adoption of sfas no 
 and to determine which  if any  of the conditional aros could be reasonably estimated 
the ability to reasonably estimate a conditional aro was a matter of management judgment  based upon management s ability to estimate a settlement date or range of settlement dates and a method or potential method of settlement of its conditional aros 
in determining whether our conditional aros could be reasonably estimated  management considered past practices  industry practices  management s intent  and the estimated economic life of the assets 
the fair value of the conditional aros was then estimated using an expected present value technique 
changes in management s assumptions regarding settlement dates  settlement methods  or assigned probabilities could have a material effect on the liability recorded at dece mber  the liabilities associated with conditional aros will be adjusted on an ongoing basis due to the passage of time and revisions to either the timing or the amount of the original estimates of undiscounted cash flows 
these adjustments could have a significant impact on the consolidated balance sheets 
for more information regarding the adoption and ongoing application of fin  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
adoption of accounting principles and recently issued accounting pronouncements mge energy and mge fin r in january  the fasb issued fin  consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 
in december  the fasb issued the updated and final interpretation fin r 
fin r requires that an equity investor in a vie have significant equity at risk generally a minimum of  which is an increase from required under the previous guidance and hold a controlling interest  evidenced by voting rights  and absorb a majority of the entity s expected losses  receive a majority of the entity s expected returns  or both 
if the equity investor is unable to evidence these characteristics  the entity that retains these ownership characteristics will be required to consolidate the vie as the primary beneficiary 
fin was applicable immediately to vies created or obtained after january  fin r was effective on december   for interests in entities that were previously considered special purpose entities under then existing authoritative guidance 
mge power west campus and mge power elm road are vies pursuant to fin r  as the equity investment was not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional support 
mge concluded a vie relationship exists due to the long term lease arrangements between mge and mge power west campus and mge and mge power elm road 
mge power west campus and mge power elm road will lease a major portion of their assets  a power plant and an undivided interest in a power plant  to mge  pursuant to these leasing arrangements  and mge will absorb a majority of the expected losses  residual returns  or both 
fin r also requires mge to assess whether the participants within its shared savings program constitute vies in which mge might be considered to be the consolidating entity 
mge has reviewed of the total shared savings program balance and has determined that the provisions of fin r are not applicable via the business scope exception 
for the remaining of the total shared savings program balance  mge has not performed this assessment 
these entities are not legally obligated to provide the financial information to mge that is necessary to determine whether mge must consolidate these entities 
mge will continue to attempt to obtain information from these customers in order to determine whether they should be consolidated by mge 
fsp on december   the medicare prescription drug  improvement  and modernization act of was signed into law  authorizing medicare to provide prescription drug benefits to retirees 
fsp  accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of  was issued on may  the fsp provides guidance on accounting for the effects of the new medicare prescription drug legislation by employers whose prescription drug benefits are actuarially equivalent to the drug benefit under medicare part d 
during the third quarter of  mge adopted the provisions of fsp  resulting in a remeasurement of its postretirement plans assets and apbo as of january  the effect of the subsidy on benefits attributable to past service was accounted for as an actuarial experience gain  resulting in a decrease in the apbo of million 
the annualized reduction in the net periodic postretirement benefit cost is estimated to be million compared to the annual cost calculated without considering the effects of the prescription drug act 
previously reported financial information for the three months ended march  and june  have also been adjusted to reflect a reduction in net periodic postretirement benefit cost as if fsp was adopted as of january  amounts for these periods  when presented for comparative purposes  are presented as such

 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  which delayed the effective date of the application guidance on impairment of securities included within eitf the eitf and the fasb are reconsidering the conclusions reached wit hin eitf in november  fasb issued fsp and  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
this fsp addresses the determination as to when an investment is considered impaired  whether the impairment is other than temporary  and the measurement of an impairment loss 
the investment is impaired if the fair value is less than cost 
the impairment is other than temporary for equity and debt securities that can contractually be prepaid or otherwise settled in such a way that the investor would not recover substantially all of its costs 
if an impairment is deemed to be other than temporary  an impairment loss shall be recognized in earnings equal to the difference between the investment s cost and its fair value 
the guidance in this fsp is effective in reporting periods beginning after december  the company has reviewed fsp a nd and does not expect the adoption of this fsp to have a material impact on its operating results or financial position 
fin in march  the fasb issued fin  accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of fasb statement no 
this interpretation clarifies that an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred if the liability s fair value can be reasonably estimated 
additionally  this interpretation clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
as of december   mge adopted fin under fin  mge is required to record a conditional aro at its estimated fair value if that fair value can be reasonably estimated 
as of december   mge had a liability of million associated with its conditional aros 
the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle related to fin had no impa ct on the utility company s consolidated statements of income due to the application of sfas no 
on december   mge received notice from the pscw permitting recognition of a regulatory asset or liability associated with the adoption of fin  and the differences in ongoing expense recognition under fin for conditional aro costs 
sfas no 
in december  the fasb issued fas statement no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions sfas no 

previously  apb opinion no 
had required that the accounting for an exchange of a productive asset for a similar productive asset or an equivalent interest in the same or similar productive asset should be based on the recorded amount of the asset relinquished 
the amendments made by sfas no 
are based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
sfas no

 accounting for changes and error corrections  a replacement of apb accounting principles board opinion no 
and sfas no 
previously  apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and sfas no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements  required the inclusion of the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principle in net income of the period of the change 
sfas no 
requires companies to recognize a change in accounting principle  including a change required by a new accounting pronouncement when the pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions  retrospectively to prior periods financial statements 
mge and mge energy will assess the impact of a retrospective application of any change in accounting principle in accordance with sfas no 
when such a change arises after the effective dat e of january  inflation the current financial statements report operating results in terms of historical cost  but they do not evaluate the impact of inflation 
because utilities can depreciate only the historical cost of utility plant  there may not be adequate cash flows from existing plant to replace this investment 
under pscw rate treatment  projected operating costs  including the impacts of inflation  are recovered in revenues 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk mge energy and mge 
mge energy and mge are potentially exposed to market risk associated with interest rates  commodity prices  weather  and equity returns 
mge currently has no exposure to foreign currency risk 
mge manages some risk exposure through risk management policies and uses derivative instruments 
mge s market risk has not changed between and mge does not enter into speculative trading transactions 
weather risk mge s sales forecasts  used to establish rates  are set by the pscw based upon estimated temperatures  which approximate year averages 
mge s electric revenues are sensitive to the summer cooling season and  to some extent  to the winter heating season 
a significant portion of mge s gas system demand is driven by heating 
mge s gas margin revenues less gas purchased is collected under a combination of fixed and volumetric rates set by the pscw based on normal weather 
as a result of weather sensitive demand and volumetric rates  a portion of mge s gas margin is at risk for warmer than normal weather 
mge may use weather derivatives  pursuant to its risk management program  to reduce the impact of weather volatility on its gas margin 
on october   mge entered into two non exchange traded weather derivatives 
the first agreement extended from november until december this agreement had a premium of million 
additionally  any payment or receipt under this agreement is limited to million 
the second agreement extends from january until march this agreement also has a premium of million 
additionally  any payment or receipt under this agreement is limited to million 
the company is accounting for the hdd collar using the intrinsic value method pursuant to the requirements of eitf no 
 accounting for weather derivatives 
through december   actual hdd were  resulting in less than a million loss for mge 
a summary of actual weather information in the utility segment s service territory during   and  as measured by degree days  may be found in results of operations 
commodity price risk mge has commodity price risk exposure with respect to the price of natural gas  electricity  coal  and oil 
mge employs established policies and procedures to reduce the market risks associated with changing commodity prices  including the use of commodity and financial instruments see footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
mge s commodity risks are somewhat mitigated by the current ratemaking process in place for recovering electric fuel  purchased energy  and the cost of natural gas purchased for resale 
mge s electric fuel costs are subject to fuel rules established by the pscw  which further mitigate commodity risk 
under the fuel rules  if electric fuel costs exceed or fall below a bandwidth set by the pscw  mge can apply for a fuel surcharge or may have a fuel credit to its customers 
under the pga authorized by the pscw  mge passes through to customers the cost of gas  subject to certain limited in centives 
effective january   the pscw modified mge s fuel rules bandwidth to a range of 
to 
mge may be required to refund to customers if the fuel rules costs fall outside the lower end of the range  and would be allowed to request a surcharge if the fuel rules costs exceeded the upper end of the range 
under the fuel rules  mge may include the costs and benefits of fuel price risk management tools implemented under a risk management plan approved by the pscw 
in  the pscw extended its conditional approval of mge s electric procurement risk management program through december  mge has a limited number of financial gas commodity contracts 
these contracts are primarily comprised of exchange traded option contracts to manage the cost of gas and over the counter financial floating to fixed price swaps and calls for the winter set price firm gas sales service pilot program 
the derivative amounts recorded as a result of these gas contracts are offset with a corresponding regulatory asset or liability because these transactions are part of the pga and not subject to incentive participation 
interest rate risk both mge and mge energy have short term borrowings at varying interest rates 
mge issues commercial paper for its short term borrowings  while mge energy draws from its current credit facility to meet its short term borrowing needs see footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
borrowing levels vary from period to period depending upon capital investments and other factors 
future short term interest expense and payments will reflect both future short term interest rates and borrowing levels 
mge energy and mge manage interest rate risk by limiting its variable rate exposure and continually monitoring the effects of market changes on interest rates 
mge is not exposed to changes in interest rates on a substantial portion of its long term debt until that debt matures and is refinanced at market rates 
assuming the current level of variable rate borrowings and assuming a change in the average interest rate under these borrowings  it is estimated that our interest expense and net income would have changed by million for mge and million for mge energy 
equity price risk pension related assets mge currently funds its liabilities related to employee benefits through trust funds 
these funds  which include investments in debt and equity securities  are managed by various investment managers 
changes in market value of these investments can have an impact on the future expenses related to these liabilities 
holding other assumptions constant  for every reduction in the expected rate of return on plan assets  annual pension expense would increase by approximately million  before taxes 
mge s risk of expense and annuity payments  as a result of changes in the market value of the trust funds  is mitigated in part through future rate actions by the pscw 
construction risk on november   mge power elm road closed on the exercise of an option to acquire an undivided ownership interest in each of two mw advanced technology  coal fired generating units being constructed by we energies in oak creek  wisconsin 
the pscw previously issued an order that approves key financial terms of the leased generation contracts including fixed construction cost of the two elm road units 
large construction projects of this type are subject to usual construction risks over which we will have limited or no control and which might adversely affect project costs and completion time 
these risks include  but are not limited to  shortages of  the inability to obtain or the cost of labor or materials  the inability of the general contractor or subcontractors to perform under their contracts  strikes  adverse weather conditions  the inability to obtain necessary permits in a timely manner and changes in applicable laws or regulations  governmental actions and events in the global economy 
if the final costs for the construction of the elm road units exceed the fixed costs allowed in the pscw order  this excess cannot be recovered from mge or its customers unless specifically allowed by the pscw 
project costs above the authorized amount  but below the cap will be subject to a prudence determination by the pscw 
the start of construction was delayed by litigation 
thus  we energies estimates that project costs will increase 
mge power elm road s estimated share of the increase is approximately million 
this represents an increase of approximately in the total cost of the project 
we energies believes these costs are ultimately recoverable under the terms of the lease agreements  however  recovery is subject to final calculation of costs and also to review and approval by the pscw 
in september  several parties filed a request with the wisconsin department of natural resources wdnr for a contested case hearing in connection with the application to the wdnr for a chapter permit for wetlands and waterways alterations and construction on the bed of lake michigan for the construction of the oak creek expansion 
that request was granted and assigned to an administrative law judge 
the hearing took place in august and in november  the administrative law judge approved the wdnr s issuance of the chapter permit for the oak creek expansion 
in december  opponents filed a petition for review of the decision in dane county circuit court 
in march  the court dismissed the appeal 
the opponents appealed the court s dismissal to the wisconsin court of appeals 
in february  the wisconsin court of appeals affirmed the lower court s dismissal of the case 
the opponent s can seek reconsideration of the court s decision or can petition the wisconsin supreme court for review 
we energies applied to the wdnr to modify the existing wisconsin pollution discharge elimination system wpdes permit that is required for operation of the water intake and discharge system for the planned oak creek expansion and existing oak creek generating units 
in march  the wdnr determined that the proposed cooling water intake structure and water discharge system meets regulatory requirements and reissued the wpdes permit with specific limitations and conditions 
the opponents filed a petition for judicial review in dane county circuit court and a request for a contested case proceeding with the wdnr 
in september  the judicial review proceeding in dane county circuit court was dismissed 
all parties to this action agreed to the dismissal 
the wdnr granted a contested case hearing and the administrative law judge has scheduled a hearing for march a decision by the administrative law judge is anticipate d in in may  we energies received the army corps of engineers federal permit necessary for the construction of the oak creek expansion 
opponents may appeal the permit in federal court 
regulatory recovery risk mge s electric operations burn natural gas in several of its peak power plants or as a supplemental fuel at several coal fired plants and  in many cases  the cost of purchased power is tied to the cost of natural gas 
mge bears significant regulatory risk for the recovery of such fuel and purchased power costs when they are higher than the base rate established in its current rate structure 
as noted above in commodity price risk  the electric operations of mge operate under a fuel rules adjustment clause for fuel and purchased power costs associated with the generation and delivery of electricity 
this clause establishes a base rate for fuel and purchased power 
in and  mge assumed the risks and benefits of variances that were within a bandwidth 
for and  fuel and purchased power costs included in mge s base fuel rates were million and million  respectively 
in  a fuel rules surcharge was in place from november  through december   which totaled million 
in  the base fuel rates included a fuel credit in the amount of million 
effective january   the pscw modified mge s fuel rules bandwidth to a range of to 
mge may be required to refund to customers if the fuel rules costs fall outside the lower end of the range  and would be allowed to request a surcharge if the fuel rules costs exceeded the upper end of the range 
credit risk counterparty credit risk is the loss that may result from counterparty nonperformance 
mge is exposed to credit risk primarily through its merchant energy business 
mge uses credit policies to manage its credit risk  which includes utilizing an established credit approval process  monitoring counterparty limits  employing credit mitigation measures such as collateral or prepayment arrangements  and using netting agreements 
due to the possibility of extreme volatility in the prices of energy commodities and derivatives  the market value of contractual positions with individual counterparties could exceed established credit limits or collateral provided by those counterparties 
if such a counterparty were then to fail to perform its obligations under its contract for example  fail to deliver the electricity mge originally contracted for  mge could sustain a loss that could have a material impact on its financial results 
additionally  if a counterparty were to default and mge were to liquidate all contracts with that entity  mge s credit loss would include the loss in value of mark to market contracts  the amount owed for settled transactions  and additional payments  if any  to settle unrealized losses on accrual contracts 
mge is obligated to provide service to all electric and gas customers within its respective franchised territories 
as a result  mge has a broad customer base 
for the year ended december   mge s ten largest electric customers represented approximately of its retail electric revenues 
mge s ten largest gas customers represented approximately of its gas revenues 
credit risk for electric and gas is managed by mge s credit and collection policies  which are consistent with state regulatory requirements 
cash  cash equivalents  and customer accounts receivable are the financial instruments that potentially subject mge energy and mge to concentrations of credit risk 
mge energy and mge place their cash and cash equivalents with high credit quality financial institutions 
mge has limited concentrations of credit risk from customer accounts receivable because of the large number of customers and strong economy in its service territory
