item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes as of december  and december   and for each of the three years in the period ended december   which are included in this annual report 
certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation 
overview we design  manufacture and market microprocessors for the computing  communications and consumer electronics markets 
we also sell embedded microprocessors for personal connectivity devices and other consumer markets 
prior to the closing of the initial public offering  or ipo  of spansion inc  our formerly consolidated majority owned subsidiary  on december   which is described in more detail below  we also manufactured and sold flash memory devices through  spansion formerly spansion llc 
total net sales for of billion increased percent compared with net sales for of billion 
this growth was driven by the performance of our computation products segment where net sales of billion increased by percent compared to  due to increased unit sales and average selling prices 
we believe that our strategy of developing new generations of products based on our customers needs contributed to accelerating customer and end user adoption of our microprocessors across all geographies 
in particular  our introduction of amd turion processors for notebook pcs in march  amd opteron dual core processors for servers and workstations in april  and amd athlon dual core processors for desktop pcs in may helped drive increasing customer adoption of our products 
moreover  we believe that our sales growth in each of our product lines outpaced the industry  resulting in increased market share for us 
sales of products for the server market was the fastest growing part of our business in  followed by sales of products for notebook pcs and sales of products for desktop pcs 
increasing demand from enterprises for our products allowed us to add a number of new customers 
as a result  percent of the top  and more than percent of the top of the forbes global companies or their subsidiaries use amd technology 
on december   spansion inc completed its ipo of  shares of its class a common stock 
prior to the ipo  spansion was our majority owned subsidiary and its financial position  results of operations and cash flows were consolidated with ours 
however  due to spansion s ipo  our ownership interest in spansion was diluted from percent to percent 
as a result  we no longer exercise control over spansion and we no longer consolidate spansion s financial position  results of operations or cash flows with ours 
we began applying the equity method of accounting to reflect our investment in spansion and our share of spansion s net income from december  based on our remaining equity interest  which is currently percent 
the overall growth of our annual net sales was partially offset by the results of our memory products segment 
in  net sales of our memory products segment of approximately billion decreased percent compared to net sales of approximately billion in in  we consolidated spansion s results of operations in our memory products segment only through december  because of spansion s ipo 
therefore  approximately million of spansion s net sales from december  through december  were excluded from our memory products net sales in other factors that contributed to the decline in memory products net sales included aggressive pricing by competitors due in most cases to oversupply of products in the nor flash memory market and a delay in spansion s qualification of a flash memory product for the wireless category  which contributed to lower memory products net sales during the first half of during  we reduced our debt and capital lease obligations by million  which includes the deconsolidation of million of spansion s indebtedness to third parties as a result of spansion s ipo 

table of contents moreover  as of december   our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled billion  which includes cash proceeds of approximately million from spansion s repayment of amounts outstanding under loans due to us  compared to billion as of december  we also substantially completed the construction and initial facilitization of fab  our millimeter wafer fabrication facility in dresden  germany 
we intend to make production shipments of wafers manufactured using nanometer technology in fab in the first quarter of and to begin manufacturing using nanometer technology by the end of our goal is to be substantially converted to nanometer technology in fab by mid the additional capacity gained through the use of larger millimeter wafers plays an important role in our growth plans for the next several years 
we plan to add production output on a steady year to year basis  while also keeping fab utilization at consistently high levels 
for  we anticipate further growth in both annual net sales and market share 
we believe critical success factors include our ability to continue to increase market acceptance of our amd technology  particularly by business enterprises  including small and medium businesses  as well as large enterprises  academic institutions and government institutions  strengthen our relationships with key customers and suppliers and establish relationships with new customers and suppliers that are industry leaders in their markets  successfully develop and transition to the latest manufacturing process technologies  ramp the production at fab and at a third party foundry on a timely basis in response to market requirements  develop and introduce new products on a timely basis and achieve efficient and timely volume production of these products  extend our portfolio of x technology from the traditional pc and server markets into embedded applications in such markets as storage subsystems  networking and telephony equipment  handheld computing devices  computation and office equipment products  and consumer electronics  design and deliver products that meet the demands of consumers as digital content becomes increasingly used with a variety of connected digital devices  and continue to expand our participation in high growth global markets 
we intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist you in understanding our financial statements  the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year  the primary factors that resulted in those changes  and how certain accounting principles  policies and estimates affect our financial statements 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis  including those related to our revenues  inventories  asset impairments  and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
although actual results have historically been reasonably consistent with management s expectations  the actual results may differ from these estimates or our estimates may be affected by different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies are the most significant to the presentation of our financial statements and require the most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
revenue reserves 
we record a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product sales and a provision for estimated future price reductions in the same period that the related revenues are recorded 
we base these estimates on actual historical sales returns  allowances  historical price reductions  market activity  and other known or anticipated trends and factors 
these estimates are subject to management s judgment  and actual provisions could be different from our estimates and current provisions  resulting in future adjustments to our revenues and operating results 

table of contents inventory valuation 
at each balance sheet date  we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence 
this evaluation includes analysis of sales levels by product and projections of future demand 
these projections assist us in determining the carrying value of our inventory and are also used for near term factory production planning 
generally  inventories on hand in excess of forecasted demand for the next six months are not valued 
in addition  we write off inventories that are considered obsolete 
we adjust remaining specific inventory balances to approximate the lower of our standard manufacturing cost or market value 
among other factors  management considers forecasted demand in relation to the inventory on hand  competitiveness of product offerings  market conditions and product life cycles when determining obsolescence and net realizable value 
if we anticipate future demand or market conditions to be less favorable than our projections as forecasted  additional inventory write downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made 
this would have a negative impact on our gross margins in that period 
if in any period we are able to sell inventories that were not valued or that had been written off in a previous period  related revenues would be recorded without any offsetting charge to cost of sales  resulting in a net benefit to our gross margin in that period 
to the extent these factors materially affect our gross margins  we would disclose them in our filings with the sec 
impairment of long lived assets 
we consider no less frequently than quarterly whether indicators of impairment of long lived assets are present 
these indicators may include  but are not limited to  significant decreases in the market value of an asset and significant changes in the extent or manner in which an asset is used 
if these or other indicators are present  we determine whether the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets in question are less than their carrying value 
if less  we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values 
fair value is determined by discounted future cash flows  appraisals or other methods 
if the asset determined to be impaired is to be held and used  we recognize an impairment loss through a charge to our operating results which also reduces the carrying basis of the related asset s 
the new carrying value of the related asset s is depreciated over the remaining estimated useful life of the asset s 
we may incur additional impairment losses in future periods if factors influencing our estimates of the undiscounted cash flows change 
income taxes 
in determining taxable income for financial statement reporting purposes  we must make certain estimates and judgments 
these estimates and judgments are applied in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of deferred tax assets  which arise from temporary differences between the recognition of assets and liabilities for tax and financial statement reporting purposes 
we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets 
if recovery is not likely  we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a charge to income tax expense  in the form of a valuation allowance  for the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable 
we consider past performance  future expected taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
as of december   all of our us deferred tax assets  net of deferred tax liabilities are subject to a full valuation allowance  which was initially established in the fourth quarter of the realization of these assets is dependent on substantial future taxable income which  at december   in management s estimate  is not more likely than not to be achieved 
in  the valuation allowance increased primarily due to the continuation of start up losses at fab in germany net of utilization of valuation allowance as a result of operating profits in the us if we in the future determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized  an appropriate amount of the previously provided valuation allowance will be reversed  resulting in a benefit to our operating results 
such benefits would be recorded on the income tax benefit provision line of our statement of operations 
in addition  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the internal revenue service or other taxing jurisdiction 
if our estimates of these taxes are greater or less than actual results  an additional tax benefit or charge will result 

table of contents results of operations we review and assess operating performance using segment revenues and operating income loss before interest  taxes and minority interest 
these performance measures include the allocation of expenses to the operating segments based on management s judgment 
prior to the third quarter of  we had two reportable segments the core products segment  which consisted of the microprocessor  memory products and other ic products operating segments  and the foundry services segment  which consisted of fees for products sold to vantis corporation  our former programmable logic devices subsidiary  and legerity inc  our former voice communication products subsidiary 
effective june   we and fujitsu executed agreements to integrate our flash memory operations including our existing joint manufacturing venture  fujitsu amd semiconductor limited  or fasl 
fasl was contributed to a new entity  spansion llc formerly known as fasl llc  which was owned percent by us and percent by fujitsu 
as a result of this transaction  we began consolidating spansion s results of operations on june  prior to june   we accounted for our share of fasl s operating results under the equity method 
as a result of the formation of spansion llc effective june   we reorganized our operating segments and created the following two reportable segments the computation products segment  which includes microprocessor products for desktop and mobile pcs  servers and workstations and chipset products  and the memory products segment  which includes spansion flash memory products 
in addition to our reportable segments  we also have the all other category that is not a reportable segment 
it includes several operating segments as well as certain operating expenses and credits that are not allocated to any of our operating segments because our chief executive officer  who is our chief operating decision maker  or codm  does not consider these operating expenses and credits in evaluating the operating performance of our operating segments 
in the fourth quarter of  we began presenting our personal connectivity solutions operating segment as a separate reportable segment because this operating segment s operating losses exceeded percent of the combined operating income loss of all our operating segments 
therefore this operating segment became a reportable segment under the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information sfas 
previously  we included our personal connectivity solutions operating segment in our all other category 
the personal connectivity solutions segment includes primarily low power  high performance x and mips architecture based embedded microprocessors and products for global commercial and consumer markets 
our all other category also includes our pic products  which were reviewed separately by our codm beginning in the third quarter of pic is not a reportable segment because the net operating results for the pic operating segment constitute less than percent of the combined operating income of all our operating segments 
prior to  revenue from sales of pic products was not material 
as a result of spansion s ipo in december and  our deconsolidation of spansion s operating results effective december  discussed above  we allocated profit sharing and bonus expenses to the specific operating segments that earned them 
therefore  these expenses are no longer included in the all other category 
the results of operations for our operating segments presented and discussed in this section follow our segment structure discussed above  and all prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year segment presentation 

table of contents as a result of spansion s ipo  our financial results of operations include spansion s financial results of operations as a consolidated subsidiary only through december  from december   spansion s operating results and financial position are not consolidated as part of our financial results 
instead  we applied the equity method of accounting to reflect our share of spansion s net income from december  through december  accordingly  our operating results  including the segment operating results for the memory products segment  for the year ended december  are not fully comparable with our results for in addition  because prior to spansion s ipo we held a percent controlling interest in spansion  fujitsu s percent share in the net income loss of spansion was reflected as a minority interest adjustment to our consolidated financial statements through december  this minority interest adjustment does not correspond to operating income loss of our memory products segment because operating income loss for our memory products segment includes operations incremental to those of spansion 
furthermore  the minority interest calculation is based on spansion s net income loss rather than operating income loss 
prior to the formation of spansion llc on june   the results of operations for periods prior to june  did not include the consolidation of spansion s results of operations 
accordingly  the segment operating information for the memory products segment for the year ended december   is not fully comparable to the reclassified segment information for the prior period presented 
we use a to week fiscal year ending on the last sunday in december 
the years ended december   december  and december   each included weeks 
references in this report to   and shall refer to the fiscal year unless explicitly stated otherwise 
the following is a summary of our net sales and operating income loss by segment and category for  and in millions net sales computation products group memory products group personal connectivity solutions group all other total net sales operating income loss computation products group memory products group personal connectivity solutions group all other total operating income loss computation products group net sales of our computation products of billion for increased percent compared to net sales of billion for primarily due to an increase of percent in unit shipments and an increase of nine percent in average selling prices 
unit shipments increased due to greater demand for desktop  mobile and server products across all geographic regions  particularly in north america and greater china 
in addition  our introduction of amd turion processors for notebook pcs in march  amd opteron dual core processors for servers and workstations in april and amd athlon dual core processors for desktop pcs in may helped drive increasing customer adoption of our products 
the increase in average selling prices was 
table of contents primarily due to increased sales of our higher priced  high performance amd based processors which contributed to a richer product mix 
computation products net sales of billion in increased percent compared to net sales of billion in the increase was primarily due to a percent increase in average selling prices and a nine percent increase in microprocessor unit shipments 
the increase in average selling prices was primarily due to increased sales of our higher priced amd based processors  particularly our amd athlon processors  which contributed to a richer product mix 
similarly  the increase in unit shipments reflected the increased demand for these processors 
sales increased across all geographic regions  and growth was particularly strong in north america and asia 
computation products operating income of million in increased by percent compared to operating income of million in the increase was primarily due to a percent increase in net sales  partially offset by a percent increase in operating expenses 
operating expenses increased million primarily due to a percent increase in unit shipments  an increase of million in research and development costs  and an increase of million in marketing and cooperative advertising costs 
the increase in research and development costs was due primarily to an increase of million in product design and process improvement costs for new generations of our microprocessors and a million increase in fab start up costs 
computation products operating income of million in increased by million compared to an operating loss of million in the increase was primarily due to a percent increase in net sales  partially offset by a percent increase in operating expenses 
operating expenses increased due primarily to an increase in marketing and cooperative advertising costs of million in connection with our amd based processors  a nine percent increase in unit shipments  and a million increase in research and development costs 
the increase in research and development costs was due primarily to a million increase in fab start up costs and a million increase in product design and engineering costs related to future generations of our microprocessors offset by a million decrease in fab research and development activities 
memory products group memory products net sales of billion in decreased percent compared to net sales of billion in in  we consolidated spansion s net sales into memory product net sales only through december  therefore  approximately million of spansion s net sales from december  through december  were excluded from memory products net sales in in addition  memory products net sales were adversely impacted due to a decrease of percent in average selling prices in compared to  partially offset by an increase of percent in unit shipments in compared to net sales for the memory products segment for are not fully comparable with net sales for because spansion s net sales are not consolidated with our net sales from december  through december  memory products net sales of billion in increased percent compared to net sales of billion in the increase in total net sales was primarily due to the effect of consolidating spansion s results of operations  which included spansion s sales to fujitsu of billion for months in compared to million for the last six months of  and also due to stronger market demand in than in  particularly in the wireless category of the flash memory market  which resulted in a nine percent increase in average selling prices 
in the second half of  demand for flash memory products began to increase significantly  and this trend continued through the first half of in the second half of  however  our memory products net sales declined due to aggressive pricing by competitors particularly in the embedded category of the flash memory market  where competitors began to aggressively pursue increased market share  and aggregate flash memory product supply exceeded demand 
in particular  decreased demand from the wireless handset market in asia  in part due to excess inventory accumulation by wireless handset oems in china during the first half of  contributed to a decline in memory product net sales during the third quarter of in addition  a 
table of contents downturn in the overall flash memory market  lower than expected sales in the wireless handset market and delays in qualifying a product based on spansion s second generation mirrorbit technology also contributed to a decline in net sales in the fourth quarter of also  memory product net sales declined in the second half of compared with the first half of because spansion was not able to meet demand for certain of lower density products for the embedded category of the flash memory market in the first half of  which we believe adversely impacted relationships with customers who did not receive allocations of these embedded products 
competitors were able to take advantage of this situation to increase their market share in the second half of spansion was unable to meet demand for these products in the first half of because in it underestimated demand with respect to these products for the first half of and was unable to install additional wafer fabrication capacity on a timely basis 
as a result  a significant number of end customers for lower density products were under served  and these customers chose to rely on competitors both for product supply and for their design in activities in the first half of  resulting in an increased market share for those competitors in the second half of when those designs went into production 
further quantification of the breakdown in the increase in net sales is not practical due to the reorganization of geographical sales territories between us and fujitsu in connection with the initial formation of spansion llc as of june  memory products had an operating loss of million in compared to operating income of million in the decline in operating results was primarily due to a decrease in net sales of million while the cost of sales only decreased million 
net sales decreased as a result of a decrease of percent in average selling prices in compared to net sales for the memory products segment for are not fully comparable with net sales for because spansion s net sales are not consolidated with our net sales from december  through december  in addition  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of approximately million during the fourth quarter of goodwill in the amount of million was generated on june  as a result of the formation of spansion llc  which we accounted for as a partial step acquisition and purchase business combination 
in the fourth quarter of  after considering the fact that the estimated fair value of spansion was less than our carrying net book value and after comparing the estimated fair value of spansion s assets other than goodwill to our carrying net book value for such assets  we concluded that the implied fair value of goodwill is zero 
therefore  we wrote off the entire million of recorded goodwill 
memory products operating income of million in increased million from an operating loss of million in the increase was primarily due to the effect of consolidating spansion s results of operations  which include spansion s sales to fujitsu  for months in compared to six months in in addition  our manufacturing costs decreased due to our transition to nanometer process technology for certain of our flash memory products in and as a result of increased shipments of flash memory products based on mirrorbit technology  which are less expensive to manufacture than flash memory products based on floating gate technology 
further quantification of the changes is not practical due to the consolidation of spansion s results of operations with our financial results as of june  personal connectivity solutions group personal connectivity solutions pcs net sales of million in increased four percent compared to net sales of million in the increase was primarily due to million increase in sales of amd geode products and million increase in sales of embedded processors  partially offset by a million decrease in sales of networking products and mips architecture based products 
pcs net sales of million in decreased seven percent compared to net sales of million in the decrease was primarily due to a million decrease in sales of certain end of life embedded microprocessors  partially offset by a million increase in sales of amd geode products 
we acquired the geode product line from national semiconductor in august accordingly  the increase in sales of amd geode products in was due to the fact that in we had months of sales whereas in we had approximately four months of sales 

table of contents pcs operating loss of million in was flat compared to an operating loss of million in the increase in net sales of million from to was offset by an increase in operating expenses of million 
pcs operating loss of million in increased compared to an operating loss of million in the increase in the operating loss was primarily due to a million increase in operating expenses 
operating expenses increased due to an increase of approximately million in manufacturing costs as a result of a change in product mix and an aggregate increase of million in marketing  general and administrative expenses as a result of activities related to our amd geode products and other product development 
manufacturing costs increased primarily because we manufactured more amd geode products  which generally are more expensive to manufacture than our other embedded processors 
all other category all other net sales in were million because of sales of pic products 
we did not generate any material sales from pic products in or all other operating loss of million in decreased from million in  primarily due to restructuring and other special charges of million incurred during due to a change in our estimate of potential sublease revenue 
all other operating loss in was million compared to operating income of million in we incurred an operating loss in  primarily due to operating expenses associated with developing and marketing pic products 
in addition  all other operating loss in included approximately million of restructuring and other special charges due to a change in our estimate of potential sublease revenue  while in we had a million credit adjustment to the restructuring charge primarily because we reduced the estimate of the numbers of positions to be eliminated in response to the additional resources required due to the spansion llc transaction and reversed the associated severance and fringe benefit accrual 
comparison of gross margin  expenses  interest income and other income expense  net  interest expense  income taxes and other expenses the following is a summary of certain consolidated statement of operations data for years ended december   december  and december  in millions except for percentages cost of sales gross margin percentage research and development marketing  general and administrative restructuring and other special charges recoveries  net interest income and other income expense  net interest expense loss on dilution of equity interest in spansion inc income tax benefit provision gross margin gross margin percentage increased to percent in compared to percent in the improvement in gross margin percentage was primarily due to microprocessor net sales  which comprised a greater percentage of total net sales in as compared to microprocessor net sales carried a higher gross margin than flash 
table of contents memory net sales 
in addition  the improvement in gross margin was due to a percent increase in gross margin for computation products 
computation products margin improved as a result of a nine percent increase in average selling prices discussed above  partially offset by increased manufacturing costs caused by the shift in our product mix to higher end microprocessor products 
gross margin also improved because we were better able to absorb our fixed manufacturing costs due in part to improving yields at fab the improvement in gross margin was partially offset by a percent decrease in gross margin for memory products due primarily to a decrease of percent in average selling prices in compared to  partially offset by an increase of percent in unit shipments in compared to gross margin percentage increased to percent in compared to percent in the increase in gross margin was primarily due to an increase in net sales of percent and lower unit manufacturing costs resulting from our transition to smaller  more cost efficient manufacturing process technologies for both microprocessors and flash memory products 
further quantification of the improvement in gross margin percentage is not practical due to the consolidation of spansion s operating results as of june  we record grants and allowances that we receive from the state of saxony and the federal republic of germany for fab or fab  and we recorded the interest subsidies we received for fab  as long term liabilities on our financial statements 
we amortize these amounts as they are earned as a reduction to operating expenses 
we record the amortization of the production related grants and allowances as a credit to cost of sales 
the credit to cost of sales totaled million in  million in and million in the fluctuations in the recognition of these credits have not significantly impacted our gross margins 
in and we capitalized construction and facilitization costs related to fab once fab begins producing revenue generating products  which we anticipate will be in the first quarter of  we will begin depreciating these costs to cost of sales 
expenses research and development expenses research and development expenses of  million in increased percent from million in due primarily to an increase of million in product design and process improvement costs for new generations of our microprocessors and increased start up costs associated with the fab project of million 
research and development expenses of million in increased ten percent from million in due in part to higher research and development expenses as a result of the consolidation of spansion llc s results of operations with our results of operations effective june   increased start up costs associated with the fab project of approximately million and a million increase in product design and engineering costs for new generations of our microprocessors 
these factors were partially offset by a million decrease in fab research and development activities 
from time to time  we also apply for and obtain subsidies from the state of saxony  the federal republic of germany and the european union for certain research and development projects 
we record the amortization of the research and development related grants and allowances as well as the research and development subsidies as a reduction of research and development expenses when all conditions and requirements set forth in the subsidy grant are met 
the credit to research and development expenses totaled million in  million in and million in 
table of contents marketing  general and administrative expenses marketing  general and administrative expenses of  million in increased percent compared to million in  primarily due to an increase of million in marketing and cooperative advertising costs and other expenses related to the percent increase in revenue in compared to in addition  in we wrote off goodwill of million  which was originally recorded in  as a result of the formation of spansion llc 
marketing  general and administrative expenses of million in increased percent compared to million in  primarily due to increased sales and cooperative advertising and marketing expenses of million primarily associated with our amd based processors  expenses from spansion of million for months of compared to million for six months in and new regulatory compliance costs of million 
effects of restructuring plan in december  we began implementing a restructuring plan the restructuring plan to further align our cost structure to industry conditions resulting from weak customer demand and industry wide excess inventory 
the restructuring plan resulted in the consolidation of facilities  primarily at our sunnyvale  california site and at sales offices worldwide 
we vacated and are attempting to sublease certain facilities currently occupied under long term operating leases through we also terminated the implementation of certain partially completed enterprise resource planning erp software and other information technology implementation activities  resulting in the abandonment of certain software  hardware and capitalized development costs 
with the exception of exit costs consisting primarily of remaining lease payments on abandoned facilities net of estimated sublease income that are payable through  we have completed the activities associated with the restructuring plan 
the following table summarizes activities under the restructuring plan through december  severance and employee benefits asset impairment facility exit and equipment decommission costs other restructuring charges total in thousands accruals at december  provision cash payments non cash charges non cash adjustments accruals at december  cash payments non cash adjustments accruals at december  cash payments accruals at december  
table of contents interest income and other income expense  net in thousands interest income other income expense  net we recorded a net income of interest income and other income expense  net of million in compared to a net expense of approximately million in  an increase of million 
this increase was due primarily to a decrease in other expense  net from million in  the components of which are discussed below  to million in the million of other expense  net in consisted primarily of a loss of approximately million during the fourth quarter of resulting from the mark to market to earnings of certain foreign currency forward contracts which became ineffective in hedging against certain forecasted foreign currency transactions that are now not expected to occur due to the change of functional currency for amd fab kg from the euro to the us dollar and approximately million of commitment and guarantee fees incurred in connection with the fab loan agreements 
in addition  interest income increased approximately million in compared to due to a percent increase in average interest rates and an increase in our average cash balances 
we recorded a net expense of interest income and other income expense  net  of million in compared to a net income of approximately million in this expense in was due primarily to a charge of approximately million related to a series of transactions pursuant to which we exchanged million of our convertible senior notes due the notes for our common stock 
the charge represented the difference between the fair value of the common stock issued in the transactions and the fair value of common stock issuable pursuant to the original conversion terms of the notes 
in addition  interest income and other income expense  net  in included a charge of approximately million in connection with our prepayment of the term loan agreement between our german subsidiary  amd saxony limited liability company co 
kg and a consortium of banks in order to finance fab  or the fab term loan  and a loss of approximately million during the second quarter of resulting from the mark to market to earnings of certain foreign currency forward contracts that we used as economic hedges of forecasted capital contributions to amd fab kg  which do not qualify as accounting hedges 
interest income was flat in compared to interest expense interest expense of million in decreased six percent compared to million in in  interest expense included approximately million of interest under the fab term loan 
because we prepaid this loan on november   we did not incur any interest in connection with this loan in in addition  interest expense incurred on our notes was million in compared with million in because the holders of an aggregate principal amount of million of these notes converted their notes into our common stock during the fourth quarter of  and we exchanged an aggregate principal amount of million of these notes in a series of transactions during the fourth quarter of for shares of our common stock 
also  during  we capitalized interest of million in connection with fab construction activities in dresden  germany  compared with million in partially offsetting these decreases in interest expense was the higher interest expense of million incurred in connection with our senior notes due the notes  which we sold on october   compared with million in and interest expense incurred pursuant to capital leases which increased by approximately million in compared with interest expense of million in was approximately flat compared to million in interest accrued on the notes during was partially offset by the absence of interest expense  as of november   for amounts outstanding under the fab term loan  and the absence of interest expense 
table of contents with respect to million of our notes  which we exchanged for our common stock in a series of transactions during the fourth quarter of in addition  we capitalized interest during of million in connection with our fab construction activities 
loss on dilution of equity interest in spansion inc prior to the spansion ipo  we held a percent controlling ownership interest in spansion  and spansion s financial position  results of operations and cash flows were consolidated with ours 
consequently  spansion s results of operations through december  have been included in our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows 
following spansion s ipo  our ownership interest was diluted from percent to percent and we no longer exercise control over spansion 
as a result  from december   the closing date of the ipo  through december  we used the equity method of accounting to reflect our investment in spansion  and we no longer consolidated spansion s financial position  operating results or cash flows with ours 
this will continue in in connection with the reduction of our ownership interest in spansion  we recorded a loss of million 
this loss represents the difference between spansion s book value per share before and after the ipo multiplied by the number of shares of spansion s common stock owned by us 
as of december   we evaluated the carrying value of our investment in spansion and concluded that  based on the relevant factors  there was no other than temporary impairment of the investment 
in accordance with apb opinion no 
as amended  the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock  if future factors indicate that a decline in the fair value of the investment is other than temporary  we would recognize a loss on our investment at that time 
to the extent that our ownership in spansion decreases in the future whether it is caused by disposal of our ownership interest or by spansion s issuance of additional common stock  we would record either a gain or a loss on such further dilution depending on spansion s book value and fair value at that time  which could have a material effect on our results of operations in the period in which this ownership dilution occurs 
income taxes we recorded an income tax benefit of million in and income tax provisions of million in and million in the income tax benefit in primarily reflects us tax benefits realized from the utilization of net operating losses and tax credits and foreign tax benefits generated by spansion in certain foreign jurisdictions 
spansion s ipo did not have a material impact on our tax provision 
the income tax provision in primarily reflects us income taxes  including taxes on the dividends repatriated from controlled foreign corporations  partially offset by foreign tax benefits because of losses in various foreign jurisdictions 
the income tax provision in primarily reflected income tax expense generated in various foreign jurisdictions  offset by a benefit of a us federal tax refund from a carryback claim we filed in as of december   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million 
we also had foreign loss carryforwards of approximately million

the spansion senior notes are general unsecured obligations of spansion llc and will rank junior to any existing and future senior debt of spansion inc or spansion llc 
interest is payable on april and october of each year beginning april  until the maturity date of april  spansion llc s obligations under the spansion senior notes are guaranteed by spansion inc  spansion technology inc  a subsidiary of spansion inc  and any restricted subsidiary of spansion that guarantees any of spansion s public debt in the future 
because we can sell these notes to a third party in a private transaction  and we intend to sell them in  we classified these notes as short term investments 
liquidity we believe that cash flows from operations and current cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balances  together with available external financing  will be sufficient to fund our operations and capital investments in the short term and long term  including the estimated additional billion in capital expenditures that we plan to incur for the fab project from through see fab term loan and guarantee and fab partnership agreements  below 
should additional funding be required  such as to meet payment obligations of our long term debt when due  we may need to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities  which may be issued from time to time under an 
table of contents effective registration statement  through the issuance of securities in a transaction exempt from registration under the securities act of  or a combination of one or more of the foregoing 
we believe that  in the event of such requirements  we will be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives 
however  given the possibility of changes in market conditions or other occurrences  there can be no certainty that such funding will be available on terms favorable to us or at all

fab term loan and guarantee and fab partnership agreements our new millimeter wafer fabrication facility  fab  is located in dresden  germany adjacent to our other wafer manufacturing facility  fab fab is owned by amd fab kg  a german limited partnership 
we control the management of amd fab kg through a wholly owned delaware subsidiary  amd fab llc  which is a general partner of amd fab kg 
amd fab kg is our indirect consolidated subsidiary 
fab will produce advanced microprocessor products  and we expect first production shipments of products manufactured using millimeter wafers in the first quarter of to date  we have provided the majority of financing for the fab project 
in addition  leipziger messe gmbh  a nominee of the state of saxony  fab beteiligungs gmbh  an investment consortium arranged by m w zander facility engineering gmbh  the general contractor for the project  and a consortium of banks are providing financing for the project 
leipziger messe and fab beteiligungs are limited partners in amd fab kg 
we also anticipate receiving up to approximately million in grants and allowances from federal and state german authorities for the fab project 
we expect that capital expenditures for fab from through will be approximately billion in the aggregate 
the funding to construct and facilitize fab consists of equity contributions from us of million under the partnership agreements  revolving loans from us of up to approximately million  and guarantees from us for amounts owed by amd fab kg and its affiliates to the lenders and unaffiliated limited partners  investments of up to approximately million from leipziger messe and fab beteiligungs  loans of up to approximately million from a consortium of banks  up to approximately million of subsidies consisting of grants and allowances  from the federal republic of germany and the state of saxony  depending on the level of capital investments by amd fab kg  of which million of cash has been received as of december   and a loan guarantee from the federal republic of germany and the state of saxony of percent of the losses sustained by the lenders referenced above after foreclosure on all other security 
as of december   we had contributed to amd fab kg the full amount of equity required under the partnership agreements and no loans were outstanding 
these amounts have been eliminated in our consolidated financial statements 
on april   amd  amd fab kg  amd fab llc  amd fab holding gmbh  a german company and wholly owned subsidiary of amd that owns substantially all of our limited partnership interest in amd fab kg  and amd fab admin gmbh  a german company and wholly owned subsidiary of amd fab holding that owns the remainder of our limited partnership interest in amd fab kg  collectively referred to as the amd companies entered into a series of agreements the partnership agreements with the unaffiliated limited partners of amd fab kg  leipziger messe and fab beteiligungs  relating to the rights and obligations with respect to their limited partner and silent partner contributions in amd fab kg 
the 
table of contents partnership has been established for an indefinite period of time 
a partner may terminate its participation in the partnership by giving twelve months advance notice to the other partners 
the termination becomes effective at the end of the year following the year during which the notice is given 
however  other than for good cause  a partner s termination will not be effective before december  also on april   amd fab kg entered into a term loan agreement and other related agreements the fab loan agreements with a consortium of banks led by dresdner bank ag  a german financial institution  to finance the purchase of equipment and tools required to operate fab the consortium of banks agreed to make available up to million in loans to amd fab kg upon its achievement of specified milestones  including attainment of technical completion at fab  which requires certification by the banks technical advisor that amd fab kg has a wafer fabrication process suitable for high volume production of advanced microprocessors and has achieved specified levels of average wafer starts per week and average wafer yields  as well as cumulative capital expenditures of approximately billion 
although amd fab kg attained these milestones in january  several conditions must still be fulfilled before amd fab kg can draw on the loans 
we anticipate that these conditions will be fulfilled in the amounts borrowed under the fab loan agreements are repayable in quarterly installments commencing in september and terminating in march amd fab kg pledged substantially all of its current and future assets as security under the fab loan agreements  we pledged our equity interest in amd fab holding and amd fab llc  amd fab holding pledged its equity interest in amd fab admin and its partnership interest in amd fab kg and amd fab admin and amd fab llc pledged all of their partnership interests in amd fab kg 
we guaranteed the obligations of amd fab kg to the lenders under the fab loan agreements 
we also guaranteed repayment of grants and allowances by amd fab kg  should such repayment be required pursuant to the terms of the subsidies provided by the federal and state german authorities 
pursuant to the terms of the guarantee  we have to comply with specified adjusted tangible net worth and ebitda financial covenants if the sum of our and our subsidiaries cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  less the amount outstanding under any third party revolving credit facility or term loan agreement with an original maturity date for amounts borrowed of up to one year group consolidated cash  declines below the following amounts amount in thousands if moody s rating is at least if standard poor s rating is at least  b or lower and b or lower  ba and bb  ba and bb  ba and bb  baa or better and bbb or better as of december   group consolidated cash was greater than million  and therefore  the preceding financial covenants were not applicable 
the partnership agreements set forth each limited partner s aggregate capital contribution to amd fab kg and the milestones for such contributions 
pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreements  amd  through amd fab holding and amd fab admin  agreed to provide an aggregate of million  leipziger messe agreed to provide an aggregate of million and fab beteiligungs agreed to provide an aggregate of million 
the capital contributions of leipziger messe and fab beteiligungs are comprised of limited partnership contributions and silent partnership contributions 
these contributions are due at various dates upon the achievement of milestones relating to the construction and operation of fab as of december   all capital contributions were made in full 
the partnership agreements also specify that the unaffiliated limited partners will receive a guaranteed rate of return of between percent and percent per annum on their total investment depending upon the monthly wafer output of fab we guaranteed these payments by amd fab kg 

table of contents in april  we amended the partnership agreements in order to restructure the proportion of leipziger messe s silent partnership and limited partnership contributions 
although the total aggregate amount that leipziger messe has agreed to provide remained unchanged  the portion of its contribution that constitutes limited partnership interests was reduced by million while the portion of its contribution that constitutes silent partnership interests was increased by a corresponding amount 
in this report  we refer to this additional silent partnership contribution as the new silent partnership amount 
pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreements and subject to the prior consent of the federal republic of germany and the state of saxony  amd fab holding and amd fab admin have a call option over the limited partnership interests held by leipziger messe and fab beteiligungs  first exercisable three and one half years after the relevant partner has completed the applicable capital contribution and every three years thereafter 
also  commencing five years after completion of the relevant partner s capital contribution  leipziger messe and fab beteiligungs each have the right to sell their limited partnership interest to third parties other than competitors  subject to a right of first refusal held by amd fab holding and amd fab admin  or to put their limited partnership interest to amd fab holding and amd fab admin 
the put option is thereafter exercisable every three years 
leipziger messe and fab beteiligungs also have a put option in the event they are outvoted at amd fab kg partners meetings with respect to certain specified matters such as increases in the partners capital contributions beyond those required by the partnership agreements  investments significantly in excess of the business plan  or certain dispositions of the limited partnership interests of amd fab holding and amd fab admin 
the purchase price under the put option is the partner s capital account balance plus accumulated or accrued profits due to such limited partner 
the purchase price under the call option is the same amount  plus a premium of million to leipziger messe and a premium of million to fab beteiligungs 
the right of first refusal price is the lower of the put option price or the price offered by the third party that triggered the right 
we guaranteed the payments under the put options 
in addition  amd fab holding and amd fab admin are obligated to repurchase the silent partnership interest of leipziger messe s and fab beteiligungs contributions over time 
this mandatory repurchase obligation does not apply to the new silent partnership amount 
specifically  amd fab holding and amd fab admin are required to repurchase leipziger messe s silent partnership interest of million in annual percent installments commencing in december  and fab beteiligungs silent partnership interest of million in annual percent installments commencing in october on september   amd fab holding and amd fab admin repurchased million of fab beteiligungs silent partnership contributions 
for accounting and financial reporting purposes under us generally accepted accounting principles  we initially classified the portion of the silent partnership contribution that is mandatorily redeemable as debt at its fair value at the time of issuance because of the mandatory redemption features described in the prior paragraph 
each accounting period  we increase the carrying value of this debt towards our ultimate redemption value of the silent partnership contributions by the guaranteed annual rate of return of between percent to percent 
we record this periodic accretion to redemption value as interest expense 
the limited partnership contributions that amd fab kg received from leipziger messe and fab beteiligungs and the new silent partnership portion described above are not mandatorily redeemable  but rather are subject to redemption outside of the control of amd fab holding and amd fab admin 
upon consolidation  we initially record these contributions as minority interest  based on their fair value 
each accounting period  we increase the carrying value of this minority interest toward our ultimate redemption value of these contributions by the guaranteed rate of return of between percent and percent 
we classify this periodic accretion of redemption value as an additional minority interest allocation 
no separate accounting is required for the put and call options because they are not freestanding instruments and not considered derivatives under sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 

table of contents as of december   amd fab kg had received million of silent partnership contributions and million of limited partnership contributions  which includes a new silent partnership amount of million  from the unaffiliated limited partners 
these contributions were recorded as debt and minority interest  respectively  in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
in addition to support from us and the consortium of banks referred to above  the federal republic of germany and the state of saxony have agreed to support the fab project in the form of a loan guarantee equal to percent of the losses sustained by the lenders after foreclosure on all other security  and subsidies consisting of grants and allowances totaling up to approximately million  depending on the level of capital investments by amd fab kg 
in connection with the receipt of subsidies for the fab project  amd fab kg is required to attain a certain employee headcount by december and maintain this headcount through december we record the subsidies as long term liabilities on our financial statements and amortize them to operations ratably starting from december through december currently  we amortize the grant amounts as a reduction to research and development expenses 
at such time as fab begins producing revenue generating products  which is expected to be in the first quarter of  we will amortize these amounts as a reduction to cost of sales 
for allowances  we will amortize the amounts as a reduction of depreciation expense ratably over the life of the equipment  starting from the first quarter of because these allowances are intended to subsidize the capital investments in equipment 
noncompliance with the covenants contained in the subsidy grant documents could result in forfeiture of all or a portion of the future amounts to be received  as well as the repayment of all or a portion of amounts received to date 
as of december   amd fab kg had received cash allowances of million for capital investments made in and as well as cash grants of million for capital investments made in and and a prepayment for capital investments planned in and the first half of the fab loan agreements also require that we provide funding to amd fab kg if cash shortfalls occur  including funding shortfalls in government subsidies resulting from any defaults caused by amd fab kg or its affiliates  and guarantee percent of amd fab kg s obligations under the fab loan agreements until the loans are repaid in full 
under the fab loan agreements  amd fab kg  amd fab holding and amd fab admin are generally prevented from paying dividends or making other payments to us 
in addition  amd fab kg would be in default under the fab loan agreements if we or any of the amd companies fail to comply with certain obligations thereunder or upon the occurrence of certain events and if  after the occurrence of the event  the lenders determine that their legal or risk position is adversely affected 
circumstances that could result in a default include our failure to provide loans to amd fab kg as required under the fab loan agreements  failure to pay any amount due under the fab loan agreements within five days of the due date  occurrence of any event which the lenders reasonably believe has had or is likely to have a material adverse effect on the business  assets or condition of amd fab kg or amd or their ability to perform under the fab loan agreements  filings or proceedings in bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to us  amd fab kg or any limited partner  occurrence of a change in control as defined in the fab loan agreements of amd  
table of contents amd fab kg s noncompliance with certain affirmative and negative covenants  including restrictions on payment of profits  dividends or other distributions except in limited circumstances and restrictions on incurring additional indebtedness  disposing of assets and repaying subordinated debt  and amd fab kg s noncompliance with certain financial covenants  including minimum tangible net worth  minimum interest cover ratio  loan to fixed asset value ratio and a minimum cash covenant 
in general  any default with respect to other indebtedness of amd or amd fab kg that is not cured  would result in a cross default under the fab loan agreements 
the occurrence of a default under the fab loan agreements would permit the lenders to accelerate the repayment of all amounts outstanding under the fab loan agreements 
in addition  the occurrence of a default under these agreements could result in a cross default under the indenture governing our notes 
we cannot provide assurance that we would be able to obtain the funds necessary to fulfill these obligations 
any such failure would have a material adverse effect on us 
generally  the amounts under the fab loan agreements and the partnership agreements are denominated in euros 
however  we report these amounts in us dollars  which are subject to change based on applicable exchange rates 
we used the exchange rate at december   of euro to one us dollar  to translate the amounts denominated in euros into us dollars 
however  with respect to amounts of equity contributions or partnership contributions  investment grants  allowances and subsidies received by amd fab kg through december   we used the historical exchange rates that were in effect at the time amd fab kg received these amounts to convert amounts denominated in euros into us dollars 
amd penang term loan on january   our subsidiary in malaysia  amd export sdn 
bhd  or amd penang  entered into a term loan agreement with a local financial institution 
under the terms of the loan agreement  amd penang can borrow up to million malaysian ringgit approximately million as of december  in order to fund the purchase of equipment 
the loan bears a fixed annual interest rate of percent and is payable in equal  consecutive  monthly principal and interest installments through february the total amount outstanding as of december  was approximately million 
this loan was transferred to spansion penang in january by novation of the outstanding amounts  and therefore  this loan is no longer outstanding 
capital lease obligations as of december   we had aggregate outstanding capital lease obligations of million 
these capital lease obligations primarily represent obligations under certain energy supply contracts which amd fab kg entered into with local energy suppliers to provide fab with utilities gas  electricity  heating and cooling to meet the energy demand for our manufacturing needs 
we accounted for certain fixed payments due under these energy supply arrangements as capital leases pursuant to eitf  determining whether an arrangement contains a lease and sfas  accounting for leases 
these capital lease obligations are payable in monthly installments through operating leases we lease certain of our facilities  including our executive offices in sunnyvale  california  and in some jurisdictions we lease the land on which these facilities are built  under non cancelable lease agreements that expire at various dates through we lease certain of our manufacturing and office equipment for terms ranging from one to five years 
our total future non cancelable lease obligations as of december   were million  of which million was recorded as a liability for certain facilities that were included in our restructuring plan 

table of contents unconditional purchase commitments total non cancelable purchase commitments as of december   were billion for periods through these purchase commitments include million related to contractual obligations of fab and fab to purchase silicon on insulator wafers and purchases of energy and gas and up to million representing future payments to ibm pursuant to our joint development agreement 
as ibm s services are being performed ratably over the life of the agreement  we expense the payments as incurred 
in august  we amended this agreement  and among other things  extended its termination date through december however  capital purchases by ibm necessary for the continued development of process development projects past december  are conditioned upon the approval of ibm s board of directors 
if such approval is not received by september   either party has the right to terminate the agreement effective december  without liability 
accordingly  the table above only reflects our obligations through december  if such approval is received from ibm  the additional obligations from january through would be between million and million 
in addition  unconditional purchase commitments also include million for software maintenance agreements that require periodic payments through the remaining commitments primarily consist of non cancelable contractual obligations to purchase raw materials  natural resources and office supplies 
purchase orders for goods and services that are cancelable without significant penalties are not included in the amount set forth in the table above 
other long term liabilities one component of other long term liabilities that requires us to make cash payments is a net restructuring accrual of million relating to the net future operating lease payments on certain facilities that were included in our restructuring plan 
we will make these payments through we included these amounts in the operating lease total in the table above 
the other components of other long term liabilities do not require us to make cash payments and primarily consist of million of deferred grants and subsidies related to the fab and fab projects and a million deferred gain as a result of the sale and leaseback of our corporate marketing  general and administrative facility in sunnyvale  california in guarantees guarantees of indebtedness recorded on our consolidated balance sheet the following table summarizes the principal guarantees issued as of december  related to underlying liabilities that are already recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  and their expected expiration dates by year

under the agreement  the amounts borrowed bear an interest rate of tibor plus a spread that is determined by fujitsu s current debt rating and spansion japan s non consolidated net asset value as of the last day of its fiscal year 
repayment occurs in equal  consecutive  quarterly principal installments ending in june as a result of spansion s ipo  the amount outstanding under this loan facility is no longer consolidated on our consolidated balance sheet 

table of contents fujitsu has guaranteed percent of the amounts outstanding under this facility 
we agreed to reimburse fujitsu percent of any amount paid by fujitsu under its guarantee of this loan 
as of december   million was outstanding under this term loan agreement 
spansion japan s assets are pledged as security for its borrowings under this agreement 
spansion capital lease guarantee we guaranteed certain capital leases entered into by spansion and its subsidiaries totaling million as of december  the amounts guaranteed are reduced by the actual amount of lease payments paid by spansion over the lease terms 
spansion operating lease guarantees we guaranteed certain operating leases entered into by spansion and its subsidiaries totaling million as of december  the amounts guaranteed are reduced by the actual amount of lease payments paid by spansion over the lease terms 
no liability has been recognized for these guarantees related to spansion under the provisions of fin because we concluded the fair value of the guarantees is not significant after considering various factors including the recent ipo of spansion  its credit rating  the ability of spansion to make the payments on these obligations and the short maturity of the indebtedness 
other financial matters termination of revolving credit facility 
on december   we terminated the amended and restated loan and security agreement dated as of july  among us  amd international sales services ltd  bank of america  na  as agent and the other lenders party thereto and repaid all of our existing obligations in full 
because no amounts were drawn under this credit facility at the time of our termination  the amount we paid to the lenders  which consisted of outstanding fees and expenses  was not material 
as part of the termination  the lenders terminated and released all security interests and liens held by them as security for our obligations 
secondary equity offering 
on january   we closed the offering of  shares of our common stock 
the net proceeds to us from this equity offering  after deducting underwriting commissions and discounts  but prior to deducting offering expenses  were approximately million 
we will use approximately million of the net proceeds from this offering to fund the redemption of percent of the aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due we intend to use the balance of the net proceeds for capital expenditures  working capital and other general corporate purposes  including the possible repayment of indebtedness 
depending on our cash position  we may from time to time elect to retire certain of our outstanding debt through open market or privately negotiated transactions or by tender offer or otherwise 
such repurchases  if any  will depend on prevailing market conditions  our liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions and other factors 
spansion agency agreement 
we have entered into an agency agreement with spansion pursuant to which we have agreed to continue to ship products to and invoice spansion s customers in our name on behalf of spansion until spansion has the capability to do so on its own 
prior to shipping the product to spansion s customers  we purchase the applicable product from spansion and pay spansion the same amount that we invoice spansion s customers 
in performing these services  we act as spansion s agent for the sale of spansion s flash memory products  and we do not receive a commission or fees for these services 
under the agreement  spansion assumes full responsibility for its products and these transactions  including establishing the pricing and determining product specifications 
spansion also assumes credit and inventory risk related to these product sales 

table of contents in accordance with eitf issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  we record sales of spansion s flash memory products and the related cost of sales on a net basis on our consolidated statements of operations 
as a result  the net impact to our net sales and cost of sales is zero 
with respect to our consolidated balance sheet  sales to spansion s customers are included in our accounts receivable line item whereas the payables to spansion that relate to the products we purchased from spansion are reflected in our accounts payable to spansion line item 
these amounts are recorded separately on the balance sheet because there is no legal right of offset in accordance with fin  offsetting of amounts related to certain contracts 
amd spansion service agreements 
we are party to various service agreements with spansion 
under our it services agreement and general services agreement  we provide  among other things  information technology  facilities  logistics  legal  tax  finance  human resources  and environmental health and safety services to spansion 
for services rendered  we are paid fees in an amount equal to cost plus five percent except for services procured by us from third parties  which are provided to spansion at cost 
unless otherwise earlier terminated  each of these service agreements expires on june   but each of us may extend the term by mutual agreement 
spansion has the ability to terminate individual services under the general services agreements at any time and for any reason upon at least six months advance notice 
with respect to the it service agreements and general service agreements  if we failed to comply with applicable service levels for a particular service and have not rectified such performance failure  spansion may terminate such service after days have elapsed since spansion first notified us of the failure to perform the service 
moreover  spansion may terminate an entire it service agreement or general services agreement if we breach our material obligations under the respective agreement and do not cure the default within days after receipt of a notice of default from spansion 
similarly  we can terminate the respective agreement for spansion s failure to make payments when due if spansion fails to cure such default within days after receipt of notice of default 
outlook we are focused on increasing sales and growing market share in a profitable manner 
however we are in an extremely competitive business 
microprocessor products compete on performance  quality  reliability  cost  selling price  adherence to industry standards  software and hardware compatibility  marketing and distribution capability  brand recognition and availability 
after a product is introduced  costs and average selling prices normally decrease over time as production efficiency improves and successive generations of products are developed and introduced for sale 
we expect sales during the first quarter of to be flat to slightly down from the fourth quarter of also  during the first quarter of  we expect operating expenses  which include research and development expenses and marketing  sales and administrative expenses  to increase by approximately percent from comparable operating expenses in the fourth quarter of  which excludes those operating expenses related to the memory products segment 
in  we expect capital expenditures to be approximately billion and depreciation and amortization expense to be approximately million 
we expect our tax rate to be between percent to percent 
in addition  in spansion s results of operations will continue to impact our results of operations 
these results will be reflected in the equity in income loss of unconsolidated investee line item on our statement of operations and for will be based on our ownership of spansion  which was percent as of december  
table of contents supplementary stock based incentive compensation disclosures section i 
stock based incentive program description our stock stock based incentive programs are intended to attract  retain and motivate highly qualified employees 
on april   our stockholders approved the equity incentive plan the plan  which had previously been approved by our board of directors 
stock options available for grant under our equity compensation plans that were in effect before april   the prior plans  including those that were not approved by our stockholders  were consolidated into the plan 
as of april   equity awards are made only from the plan 
under our prior plans key employees generally were  and under the plan key employees generally have been  granted nonqualified stock options nsos to purchase our common stock 
generally  options vest and become exercisable over a four year period from the date of grant and expire five to ten years after the date of grant 
any incentive stock options isos granted under the prior plans or the plan have exercise prices of not less than percent of the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant 
exercise prices of nsos ranged from to the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant 
we plan to grant employees primarily restricted stock units under the plan in under the plan  we can also grant up to a total of million shares where the exercise price is less than the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant 
these types of grants can consist of the following awards restricted stock 
restricted stock can be granted to any employee or consultant 
restricted stock that vests based on continued service does not fully vest for three years from the date of grant 
restricted stock that vests based on performance does not vest for at least one year from the date of grant 
restricted stock units 
restricted stock units are awards that obligate us to issue a specific number of shares of our common stock in the future if the vesting terms and conditions are satisfied 
restricted stock units based on continued service may not fully vest for three years from the date of grant 
restricted stock units that are performance based may not vest for at least one year from the date of grant 
discount stock options 
discount stock options may be subject to the same requirements and conditions as are applicable to regular nsos described above except that the fixed exercise price may be granted at up to percent of fair market value on the date of grant  if the discount is in lieu of a portion of salary or cash bonus 
options cannot be exercised until they become vested 
options expire not later than years after the date of grant 
on april   we accelerated the vesting of all stock options outstanding under the plan and our prior equity compensation plans that had exercise prices per share higher than the closing price of our stock on april   which was 
options to purchase approximately million shares of our common stock became exercisable immediately 
options held by non employee directors were not included in the vesting acceleration 
the primary purpose for accelerating the vesting was to eliminate future compensation expense we would otherwise recognize in our statement of operations with respect to these accelerated options upon the adoption of financial accounting standards board statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of and will require that compensation expense associated with stock options be recognized in the statement of operations  rather than as a footnote disclosure in our consolidated financial statements 
the acceleration of the vesting of these options did not result in a charge based on us generally accepted accounting principles 
on december   we accelerated the vesting of all outstanding amd stock options and restricted stock units held by spansion employees that would otherwise have vested from december  to 
table of contents december  in connection with the modification of the terms of these options to accelerate their vesting  million was recorded as non cash compensation expense on a pro forma basis in accordance with sfas  and this amount was included in the pro forma stock compensation expense for the year ended december  the primary purpose for accelerating the vesting of these awards was to minimize future compensation expense that we and spansion would otherwise have been required to recognize in spansion s and our respective statements of operations with respect to these awards 
if we had not accelerated the vesting of these awards  they would have been subject to variable accounting in accordance with the guidance provided in eitf issue and this accounting treatment would have applied because following spansion s ipo  we no longer consolidate spansion s results of operations in our financial statements 
accordingly  spansion employees are no longer considered our employees 
under variable fair value accounting  we would have been required to re measure the fair value of unvested stock based awards of our common stock held by spansion employees after spansion s ipo at the end of each accounting period until such awards were fully vested 
in connection with the acceleration of the vesting of these awards  we recorded a compensation charge in the fourth quarter of of million 
in addition to the acceleration of vesting of certain stock awards as indicated above  there are approximately  unvested amd stock options and restricted stock units that are still held by spansion employees which are currently subject to variable accounting 
in accordance with eitf  the resulting compensation charge will be recorded in the company s consolidated statements of operations in the same caption as the equity in income loss of unconsolidated investee

outstanding shares as of december   december  and december  the listed officers are those executive officers listed in the summary compensation table in our proxy statements for our annual meeting of stockholders held in  and recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standard board fasb issued a revision to statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas r 
sfas r eliminates our ability to use the intrinsic value method of accounting under apb opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees  and generally requires a public entity to reflect on its income statement  instead of pro forma disclosures in its financial footnotes  the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity based on the grant date fair value of the award 
the grant date fair value will be estimated using option pricing models adjusted for the unique characteristics of those equity instruments 
among other things  sfas r also requires entities to estimate the number of instruments for which the requisite service is expected to be rendered and  if the terms or conditions of an equity award are modified after the grant date  to recognize incremental compensation cost for such a modification by comparing the fair value of the modified award with the fair value of the award immediately before the modification 
in addition  sfas r amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows  to require that excess tax benefits be reported as a financing cash inflow rather than as a reduction of taxes paid 
we will adopt sfas r in the first quarter of sfas r applies to all awards granted after the required effective date and to awards modified  repurchased  or cancelled after that date 

table of contents as of the required effective date  all public entities that used the fair value based method for either recognition or disclosure under the original sfas will apply this revised statement using a modified version of prospective application 
under that transition method  compensation cost is recognized on or after the required effective date for the portion of outstanding awards  for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered  based on the grant date fair value of those awards calculated under the original sfas for either recognition or pro forma disclosures 
for periods before the required effective date  those entities may elect to apply a modified version of retrospective application under which financial statements for prior periods are adjusted on a basis consistent with the pro forma disclosures required for those periods by the original sfas in march  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab regarding the sec s interpretation of sfas r and the valuation of share based payments for public companies 
we will apply the modified prospective method  which requires that compensation expense be recognized for all share based payments granted  modified or settled after the date of adoption plus the current period expense for unvested awards issued prior to the adoption of this standard 
no expense is recognized for awards vested in prior periods 
although we cannot estimate the exact amount at this time  we expect that the adoption of this statement will have a material effect on our financial statements and will depend on the levels of share based payments granted in the future 
due to the acceleration of options during  the compensation expense previously reported in pro forma disclosures is not expected to be representative of future expected compensation expense 
in addition  beginning in  amd will change its method of valuation for share based awards granted from the black scholes option pricing model  which was previously used for our pro forma information required under sfas  to a lattice binominal option pricing model 
in  we also expect to issue fewer stock options than have been issued in the past  and plan to grant employees primarily restricted stock units 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections sfas  which replaces apb opinion no 
 accounting changes and sfas no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements an amendment of apb opinion no 
sfas provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections 
it establishes retrospective application  or the latest practicable date  as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle and the reporting of a correction of an error 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  we will adopt sfas in the first quarter of and do not expect that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas 
this statement clarifies that abnormal inventory costs such as costs of idle facilities  excess freight and handling costs  and wasted material spoilage are required to be recognized as current period charges 
in addition  the statement requires that allocation of fixed production overhead to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions of this statement became effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we adopted this statement at the beginning of because we are already in compliance with sfas  the adoption of this statement will not have an impact on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents risk factors risks related to our business intel corporation s dominance of the microprocessor market and its aggressive business practices may limit our ability to compete effectively 
intel has dominated the market for microprocessors used in desktop and mobile pcs for many years 
intel is also a dominant competitor in the server category of the microprocessor market 
intel s significant financial resources enable it to market its products aggressively  to target our customers and our channel partners with special incentives  and to discipline customers who do business with us 
these aggressive activities can result in lower unit sales and average selling prices for our products and adversely affect our margins and profitability 
as long as intel remains in this dominant position  we may be materially adversely affected by intel s business practices  including pricing and allocation strategies and actions  such as aggressive pricing for microprocessors to increase market share  product mix and introduction schedules  product bundling  marketing and merchandising strategies  exclusivity payments to its current and potential customers  control over industry standards  pc manufacturers and other pc industry participants  including motherboard  memory  chipset and basic input output system  or bios  suppliers  and marketing and advertising expenditures in support of positioning the intel brand over the brand of its oem customers 
for example  intel exerts substantial influence over pc manufacturers and their channels of distribution through various brand and other marketing programs 
because of its dominant position in the microprocessor market  intel has been able to control x microprocessor and pc system standards and dictate the type of products the microprocessor market requires of intel s competitors 
intel also dominates the pc system platform  which includes core logic chipsets  graphics chips  motherboards and other components necessary to assemble a pc system 
as a result  pc oems are highly dependent on intel  less innovative on their own and  to a large extent  are distributors of intel technology 
additionally  intel is able to drive de facto standards for x microprocessors that could cause us and other companies to have delayed access to such standards 
we expect intel to maintain its dominant position in the microprocessor market and to continue to invest heavily in marketing  research and development  new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies 
intel has substantially greater financial resources than we do and accordingly spends substantially greater amounts on research and development and production capacity than we do 
moreover  intel currently manufactures certain of its microprocessor products on millimeter wafers using nanometer process technology whereas we expect to make our first production shipments of products manufactured on millimeter wafers using nanometer process technology in the first quarter of we expect to begin commercial shipments of microprocessors manufactured using nanometer technology by the end of to the extent intel manufactures its microprocessor products on larger wafers and smaller process technologies earlier than we do  we may be more vulnerable to intel s aggressive marketing and pricing strategies for microprocessor products  which may result in market share gains for intel 
intel s dominant position in the microprocessor market  its existing relationships with top tier oems and its aggressive marketing and pricing strategies could result in lower unit sales and average selling prices for our products  which could have a material adverse effect on us 
we must achieve further market acceptance of our bit technology  amd  or we will be materially adversely affected 
our amd opteron processors are critical to our strategy of increasing market share in the server category of the microprocessor market 
similarly  our amd turion processors are critical to our strategy of increasing 
table of contents market share in the mobile category of the microprocessor market  and particularly the thin and light category 
accordingly  we are making substantial investments in our roadmaps and our platforms for our processors for mobile and server computers 
increasing market acceptance of these processors  our amd athlon processors for desktops and the amd technology on which they are based is subject to risks and uncertainties including the continued support of operating system and application program providers for our bit instruction set  including timely development of bit software applications and applications that can take advantage of the functionality of dual core processors  our ability to produce these processors in a timely manner on advanced process technologies  in the volume and with the performance and feature set required by customers  and the availability  performance and feature set of motherboards  memory and chipsets designed for these processors  in the volume and with the performance and feature set required by our customers 
if we are unable to achieve further market acceptance of our amd technology  we would be materially adversely affected 
we cannot be certain that our substantial investments in research and development of process technologies will lead to timely improvements in technology and equipment used to fabricate our products or that we will have sufficient resources to invest in the level of research and development that is required to remain competitive 
we make substantial investments in research and development for process technologies in an effort to design and manufacture leading edge microprocessors 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to develop  obtain or successfully implement leading edge process technologies needed to manufacture future generations of our products profitably or on a timely basis or that our competitors will not develop new technologies  products or processes that render our products uncompetitive or obsolete 
furthermore  we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to maintain the level of investment in research and development that is required for us to remain competitive 
for example  we have a joint development agreement with ibm  pursuant to which we have agreed to work together to develop new process technologies through december  however  capital purchases by ibm necessary for the continued development of process development projects past december  are conditioned upon the approval by ibm s board of directors 
if such approval is not received by september   either party has the right to terminate the agreement effective december  without liability 
we anticipate that under this agreement  from december  through december   we would pay fees to ibm of between million and million in connection with joint development projects 
in addition  from the beginning of through december   we paid million to ibm in connection with agreements and services related to license grants and research and development activities 
if this agreement were to be terminated  we would either have to resume certain research and development activities internally or find an alternate partner 
in either case  our research and development costs could increase  and we could experience delays or other setbacks in the development of new process technologies  any of which would materially adversely affect us 
moreover  the timely achievement of the milestones set forth in the joint development agreement is critical to our ability to continue to manufacture microprocessors at fab using advanced process technologies 
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has experienced severe downturns that materially adversely affected  and may in the future materially adversely affect  our business 
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has experienced significant downturns  often in conjunction with constant and rapid technological change  wide fluctuations in supply and demand  continuous 
table of contents new product introductions  price erosion and declines in general economic conditions 
our historical financial results have also been subject to substantial fluctuations 
our financial performance has been  and may in the future be  negatively affected by these downturns 
we incurred substantial losses in recent downturns  due to the cyclical nature of supply demand imbalances in the semiconductor industry  a decline in demand for end user products that incorporate our semiconductors  excess inventory levels in the channels of distribution  including our customers  excess production capacity  and substantial declines in average selling prices 
for example  in and we implemented restructuring plans due to weak customer demand associated with the downturn in the semiconductor industry 
if the semiconductor industry were to experience a downturn in the future  we would be materially adversely affected 
the demand for our products depends in part on continued growth in the industries and geographies into which they are sold 
a market decline in any of these industries or geographies would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
our business is dependent upon the market for mobile and desktop pcs  and servers 
industry wide fluctuations in the computer marketplace have materially adversely affected us in the past and may materially adversely affect us in the future 
depending on the growth rate of computers sold  sales of our microprocessors may not grow and may even decrease 
if demand for computers is below our expectations  we could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  potential market share increases by customers who exclusively purchase microprocessors from intel corporation  such as dell  inc  could further materially adversely affect us 
the growth of our business is also dependent on continued demand for our products from high growth global markets 
in  sales of our products to high growth markets such as china  eastern europe and india increased compared to  and these markets are an important area of future growth for us 
if demand from these markets is below our expectations  sales of our products may not grow  and may even decrease  which would have a material adverse effect on us 
intense competition in the microprocessor market could materially adversely affect us 
our principal competitor in the microprocessor market is intel corporation 
microprocessor products compete on performance  quality  reliability  cost  selling price  adherence to industry standards  software and hardware compatibility  brand recognition and availability 
after a product is introduced  costs and average selling prices normally decrease over time as production efficiency improves  and successive generations of products are developed and introduced for sale 
we may not be able to compete effectively if we fail to reduce our manufacturing costs and develop  introduce and sell on a timely basis  new products or enhanced versions of existing products at competitive prices 
we depend on third party companies for the design and manufacture of core logic chipsets  graphics chips  motherboards  bios software and other components 
our microprocessors are not designed to function with motherboards and chipsets designed to work with intel microprocessors because our patent cross license agreement with intel does not extend to intel s proprietary bus interface protocol 
accordingly  we depend on third party companies for the design and manufacture of core logic chipsets  graphics chips  motherboards  bios software and other components that support our microprocessor offerings 
in recent years  many of these third party designers and manufacturers have lost 
table of contents significant market share to intel or exited the business 
if we are unable to secure sufficient support for our microprocessor products from these designers and manufacturers  or if suppliers of chipsets cannot provide us with sufficient quantities of chipset products to meet our demand  our business would be materially adversely affected 
if we are ultimately unsuccessful in any of our antitrust lawsuits against intel  our business may be materially adversely affected 
on june   we filed an antitrust complaint against intel corporation and intel s japanese subsidiary  intel kabushiki kaisha  which we refer to collectively as intel  in the united states district court for the district of delaware under section of the sherman antitrust act  sections and of the clayton act  and the california business and professions code 
our complaint alleges that intel has unlawfully maintained a monopoly in the x microprocessor market by engaging in anti competitive financial and exclusionary business practices that limit the ability and or incentive of intel s customers in dealing with amd 
also  on june   our subsidiary in japan  amd japan kk  filed an action in japan against intel kk in the tokyo high court and the tokyo district court for damages arising from violations of japan s antimonopoly act 
if our antitrust lawsuits against intel are ultimately unsuccessful  our business  including our ability to increase market share in the microprocessor market  could be materially adversely affected 
the loss of a significant customer may have a material adverse effect on us 
collectively  our top five oem and distributor computation products customers accounted for a significant percentage of our total net sales in if one of these customers decided to stop buying our products  or if one of these customers were materially to reduce its operations or its demand for our products  we would be materially adversely affected 
if we fail to keep pace with new product designs and improvements or if we pursue technologies that do not become commercially accepted  customers may not buy our products and we may be adversely affected 
our success depends to a significant extent on the development  qualification  implementation and acceptance of new product designs and improvements that provide value to our customers 
our ability to develop and qualify new products and related technologies to meet evolving industry requirements  at prices acceptable to our customers and on a timely basis are significant factors in determining our competitiveness in our target markets 
if we are delayed in developing or qualifying new products or technologies  such as high performance  low power processors  we could be materially adversely affected 
our operating results are subject to quarterly and seasonal sales patterns 
a substantial portion of our quarterly sales have historically been made in the last month of the quarter 
this uneven sales pattern makes prediction of net sales for each financial period difficult and increases the risk of unanticipated variations in quarterly results and financial condition 
in addition  our operating results tend to vary seasonally 
for example  demand in the retail sector of the pc market is often stronger during the fourth quarter as a result of the winter holiday season 
european sales are often weaker during the summer months 
many of the factors that create and affect seasonal trends are beyond our control 
manufacturing capacity constraints and manufacturing capacity utilization rates may have a material adverse affect on us 
there may be situations in which our manufacturing facilities are inadequate to meet the demand for certain of our products 
our inability to obtain sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet demand  either in our own facilities or through foundry or similar arrangements with third parties  could have a material adverse effect on us 

table of contents in november  we entered into sourcing and manufacturing technology agreements with chartered semiconductor manufacturing whereby chartered agreed to become an additional manufacturer of our amd based microprocessors 
we expect that chartered will begin production in the ability of chartered to begin production on a timely basis depends on several factors beyond our control  including chartered s ability to implement our technology at their facilities on a timely basis 
in addition  the additional capacity gained through the use of millimeter wafers at fab plays a fundamental role in our growth plans for the next several years 
we plan to add production output at fab on a year to year basis 
if we are not able to achieve our production plans at fab on a timely basis  we may not have sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet demand for our products 
if we cannot obtain sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet demand for our products  either in our own facilities or through foundry or similar arrangements  we could be materially adversely affected 
if essential equipment or materials are not available to manufacture our products  we could be materially adversely affected 
our manufacturing operations depend upon obtaining deliveries of equipment and adequate supplies of materials on a timely basis 
we purchase equipment and materials from a number of suppliers 
from time to time  suppliers may extend lead times  limit supply to us or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors 
because the equipment that we purchase is complex  it is difficult for us to substitute one supplier for another or one piece of equipment for another 
certain raw materials we use in manufacturing our products are available only from a limited number of suppliers 
for example  we are largely dependent on one supplier for our millimeter and millimeter silicon on insulator soi wafers 
although we are in the process of qualifying alternate sources  we do not believe that they currently have sufficient capacity to meet our requirements for soi wafers 
we are also dependent on key chemicals from a limited number of suppliers and rely on a limited number of foreign companies to supply the majority of certain types of integrated circuit packages 
interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry could cause shortages and price increases in various essential materials 
if we are unable to procure certain of these materials  we may have to reduce our manufacturing operations 
such a reduction has in the past and could in the future have a material adverse effect on us 
industry overcapacity could cause us to under utilize our manufacturing facilities and have a material adverse effect on us 
semiconductor companies with their own manufacturing facilities and specialist semiconductor foundries  which are subcontractors that manufacture semiconductors designed by others  have added significant capacity in recent years and we expect them to continue to do so 
in the past  capacity additions sometimes exceeded demand requirements leading to oversupply situations and downturns in the industry 
fluctuations in the growth rate of industry capacity relative to the growth rate in demand for our products contribute to cyclicality in the semiconductor market  which may in the future put pressure on our average selling prices and materially adversely affect us 
it is difficult to predict future growth or decline in the markets we serve  making it very difficult to estimate requirements for production capacity 
if our target markets do not grow as we anticipate  we may under utilize our manufacturing facilities  which may result in write downs or write offs of inventories and losses on products whose demand is lower than we anticipate 
in addition  during periods of industry overcapacity  customers do not generally order products as far in advance of the scheduled shipment date as they do during periods when our industry is operating closer to capacity  which can exacerbate the difficulty in forecasting capacity requirements 
many of our costs are fixed 
accordingly  during periods in which we under utilize our manufacturing facilities as a result of reduced demand 
table of contents for certain of our products  our costs cannot be reduced in proportion to the reduced revenues for such a period 
when this occurs  our operating results are materially adversely affected 
we are substantially increasing our manufacturing capacity by facilitizing fab  transitioning to smaller manufacturing process technologies and larger wafers and making significant capital investments in our existing manufacturing facilities 
if the increase in demand for our products is not consistent with our expectations  we may underutilize our manufacturing facilities 
this has in the past had  and in the future may have  a material adverse effect on us 
unless we maintain manufacturing efficiency  our future profitability could be materially adversely affected 
manufacturing our products involves highly complex processes that require advanced equipment 
our manufacturing efficiency is an important factor in our profitability  and we cannot be sure that we will be able to maintain or increase our manufacturing efficiency to the same extent as our competitors 
we continually modify manufacturing processes in an effort to improve yields and product performance and decrease costs 
we may fail to achieve acceptable yields or experience product delivery delays as a result of  among other things  capacity constraints  construction delays  delays in the development of new process technologies  changes in our process technologies  upgrades or expansion of existing facilities  or impurities or other difficulties in the manufacturing process 
improving our manufacturing efficiency in future periods is dependent on our ability to develop advanced product and process technologies  successfully transition to advanced process technologies  ramp product and process technology improvements rapidly and effectively to commercial volumes across our facilities  and achieve acceptable levels of manufacturing wafer output and yields  which may decrease as we implement more advanced technologies 
for example  we plan to begin nanometer production by the end of our goal is to be substantially converted to nanometer in fab by mid during periods when we are implementing new process technologies  manufacturing facilities may not be fully productive 
a substantial delay in the technology transitions to smaller process technologies could have a material adverse effect on us  particularly if our competitors transition to more cost effective technologies earlier than we do 
our results of operations would also be adversely affected by the increase in fixed costs and operating expenses related to increases in production capacity if revenues do not increase proportionately 
if we lose microsoft corporation s support for our products  our ability to sell our microprocessors could be materially adversely affected 
our ability to innovate beyond the x instruction set controlled by intel depends partially on microsoft designing and developing its operating systems to run on or support our microprocessor products 
if microsoft does not continue to design and develop its operating systems so that they work with our x instruction sets  independent software providers may forego designing their software applications to take advantage of our innovations and customers may not purchase pcs with our microprocessors 
if we fail to retain the support of microsoft  our ability to market our microprocessors would be materially adversely affected 
we have a substantial amount of indebtedness that could adversely affect our financial position 
our indebtedness may make it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations  including making scheduled principal and interest payments  
table of contents limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and general corporate and other purposes  limit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or other general corporate purposes  require us to use a portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments  limit our flexibility to plan for  or react to  changes in our business and industry  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors  and increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions 
if we cannot generate sufficient operating cash flow or obtain external financing  we may be unable to make all of our planned capital expenditures or fulfill our obligations 
for  our capital expenditures were billion which included spansion s capital expenditures through december  for  we plan to make approximately billion of capital expenditures 
our ability to fund capital expenditures in accordance with our business plan depends on generating sufficient cash flow from operations and the availability of external financing 
moreover  under the revolving credit agreement among amd  amd fab holding and amd fab kg  we or amd fab holding are required to provide up to million to amd fab kg based on an exchange rate of euros to one us dollar as of december  
loans provided to amd fab kg under this revolving credit agreement are unsecured and subordinated to the rights of the consortium of banks that will also be providing financing to amd fab kg 
our capital expenditures  together with ongoing operating expenses  will be a substantial drain on our cash flow and may decrease our cash balances 
the timing and amount of our capital requirements cannot be precisely determined at this time and will depend on a number of factors including future demand for products  product mix  changes in semiconductor industry conditions and market competition 
we regularly assess markets for external financing opportunities  including debt and equity 
additional debt or equity financing may not be available when needed or  if available  may not be available on satisfactory terms 
our inability to obtain needed debt and or equity financing or to generate sufficient cash from operations may require us to abandon projects or curtail capital expenditures 
if we curtail capital expenditures or abandon projects  we could be materially adversely affected 
we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantially more debt  including secured debt  in the future 
subject to the restrictions in the agreements governing our existing indebtedness  we and our subsidiaries may incur significant additional debt  including secured debt  in the future 
in particular  amd fab kg will have the ability  subject to achieving certain milestones  to borrow up to million based on an exchange rate of euros to one us dollar as of december  from a consortium of banks under its fab loan agreements 
although the terms of the agreements governing our existing indebtedness contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt  these restrictions are subject to a number of important exceptions  and debt incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial 
we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our debt obligations 
our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt  or our guarantees of other parties debts  will depend on our financial and operating performance  which may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter  
table of contents and is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial  business and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
we cannot assure you that we will continue to generate sufficient cash flow or that we will be able to borrow funds in amounts sufficient to enable us to service our debt or to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements 
if we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or to borrow sufficient funds to service our debt due to a failure to meet drawdown conditions or otherwise  we may be required to sell assets or equity  reduce capital expenditures  refinance all or a portion of our existing debt or obtain additional financing 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance our debt  sell assets or equity or borrow more funds on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
our debt instruments impose restrictions on us that may adversely affect our ability to operate our business 
the indenture governing our notes contains various covenants that limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends and make other restricted payments  make certain investments  create or permit certain liens  create or permit restrictions on the ability of certain restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to us  use the proceeds from sales of assets  enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates  and consolidate or merge or sell our assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety 
in addition  the fab loan agreements contain restrictive covenants  including a prohibition on the ability of amd fab kg and its affiliated limited partners to pay us dividends and other payments and also require us to maintain specified financial ratios when group consolidated cash is below specified amounts 
our ability to satisfy these covenants  financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control 
we cannot assure you that we will meet those requirements 
a breach of any of these covenants  financial ratios or tests could result in a default under the applicable agreement 
moreover  our agreements contain cross default provisions whereby a default under one agreement would likely result in cross default under agreements covering other borrowings 
for example  the occurrence of a default with respect to any indebtedness that results in acceleration of the maturity date or any failure to repay debt when due in an amount in excess of million would cause a cross default under the indenture governing our notes 
the occurrence of a default under any of these borrowing arrangements would permit the applicable lenders or note holders to declare all amounts outstanding under those borrowing arrangements to be immediately due and payable 
if the note holders or the trustee under the indenture governing our notes accelerates the repayment of borrowings  we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to repay those borrowings and our other indebtedness 
if we are unable to comply with the covenants in the subsidy grant documents that we receive from the state of saxony  the federal republic of germany and or the european union for fab  fab or other research and development projects we may undertake in germany  we may forfeit or have to repay our subsidies  which could materially adversely affect us 
we receive capital investment grants and allowances from the state of saxony and the federal republic of germany for fab we have also received capital investment grants and allowances as well as interest 
table of contents subsidies from these governmental entities for fab from time to time  we also apply for and obtain subsidies from the state of saxony  the federal republic of germany and the european union for certain research and development projects 
the subsidy grant documents typically contain covenants that must be complied with  and noncompliance with the conditions of the grants  allowances and subsidies could result in the forfeiture of all or a portion of any future amounts to be received  as well as the repayment of all or a portion of amounts received to date 
if we are unable to comply with any of the covenants in the grant documents  we may be materially adversely affected 
if our microprocessors are not compatible with some or all industry standard software and hardware  we could be materially adversely affected 
our microprocessors may not be fully compatible with some or all industry standard software and hardware 
further  we may be unsuccessful in correcting any such compatibility problems in a timely manner 
if our customers are unable to achieve compatibility with software or hardware after our products are shipped in volume  we could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  the mere announcement of an incompatibility problem relating to our products could have a material adverse effect on us 
costs related to defective products could have a material adverse effect on us 
if one or more of our products were found to be defective after the product had been shipped to customers in volume  the cost of product replacements or product returns would be substantial  and our reputation with our customers would be damaged 
in addition  we could incur substantial costs to implement modifications to fix defects 
any of these problems could materially adversely affect us 
our inability to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel may hinder our product development programs 
our future success depends upon the continued service of numerous qualified engineering  manufacturing  marketing  sales and executive personnel 
if we are not able to continue to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel necessary for our business  the progress of our product development programs could be hindered  and we could be materially adversely affected 
we outsource to third parties certain supply chain logistics functions  including physical distribution of our products  and co source some information technology services 
we rely on a third party provider to deliver our products to our customers and to distribute materials for our manufacturing facilities 
in addition  we rely on a third party in india to provide certain information technology services to us  including helpdesk support  desktop application services  business and software support applications  server and storage administration  data center operations  database administration  and voice  video and remote access 
our relationships with these providers are governed by fixed term contracts 
we cannot guarantee that these providers will fulfill their respective responsibilities in a timely manner in accordance with the contract terms  in which case our internal operations  the distribution of our products to our customers and the distribution of materials for our facilities could be materially adversely affected 
also  we cannot guarantee that our contracts with these third party providers will be renewed  in which case we would have to transition these functions in house or secure new providers  which could have a material adverse effect on us 
in addition  we decided to outsource or co source these functions to third parties primarily to lower our operating expenses and to create a more variable cost structure 
however  if the costs related to administration  communication and coordination of these third party providers are greater than we expect  then we will not realize our anticipated cost savings 

table of contents uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of  and payment for  our products could materially adversely affect us 
we typically sell our products pursuant to individual purchase orders 
we generally do not have long term supply arrangements with our customers 
generally  our customers may cancel orders days or more prior to shipment without incurring a significant penalty 
we base our inventory levels on customers estimates of demand for their products  which are difficult to predict 
this difficulty may be compounded when we sell to oems indirectly through distributors  as our forecasts for demand are then based on estimates provided by multiple parties 
in addition  our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason 
the cancellation or deferral of product orders  the return of previously sold products or overproduction due to failure of anticipated orders to materialize could result in excess or obsolete inventory  which could result in write downs of inventory 
because market conditions are uncertain  these and other factors could materially adversely affect us 
our reliance on third party distributors subjects us to certain risks 
we market and sell our products directly and through third party distributors pursuant to agreements that can generally be terminated for convenience by either party upon prior notice to the other party 
these agreements are non exclusive and permit our distributors to offer our competitors products 
our third party distributors have been a significant factor in our ability to increase sales of our products in certain high growth international markets 
accordingly  we are dependent on our distributors to supplement our direct marketing and sales efforts 
if any significant distributor or a substantial number of our distributors terminated their relationship with us or decided to market our competitors products over our products  our ability to bring our products to market would be impacted and we would be materially adversely affected 
additionally  distributors typically maintain an inventory of our products 
in most instances  our agreements with distributors protect their inventory of our products against price reductions  as well as provide return rights for any product that we have removed from our price book or that is not more than twelve months older than the manufacturing code date 
some agreements with our distributors also contain standard stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns 
we defer the gross margins on our sales to distributors  resulting from both our deferral of revenue and related product costs  until the applicable products are re sold by the distributors 
however  in the event of an unexpected significant decline in the price of our products  the price protection rights we offer to our distributors would materially adversely affect us because our revenue would decline 
our operations in foreign countries are subject to political and economic risks  which could have a material adverse effect on us 
all of our wafer fabrication capacity for microprocessors is located in germany 
nearly all product assembly and final testing of our products is performed at manufacturing facilities in china  malaysia and singapore 
we also depend on foreign foundry suppliers for the production of certain of our embedded microprocessors for personal connectivity devices and we depend on an international joint venture for the manufacture of optical photomasks for use in manufacturing our microprocessors 
in addition  we have international sales operations and as part of our business strategy  we are continuing to seek expansion of product sales in high growth markets 
our international sales as a percentage of our total consolidated net sales was percent in and china was one of our largest and fastest growing markets 
the political and economic risks associated with our operations in foreign countries include  without limitation expropriation  changes in a specific country s or region s political or economic conditions  changes in tax laws  trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements  
table of contents difficulties in protecting our intellectual property  difficulties in achieving headcount reductions  changes in foreign currency exchange rates  restrictions on transfers of funds and other assets of our subsidiaries between jurisdictions  changes in freight and interest rates  disruption in air transportation between the united states and our overseas facilities  and loss or modification of exemptions for taxes and tariffs 
any conflict or uncertainty in the countries in which we operate  including public health or safety concerns  natural disasters or general economic factors  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
any of the above risks  should they occur  could have a material adverse effect on us 
worldwide economic and political conditions may adversely affect demand for our products 
worldwide economic conditions may adversely affect demand for our products 
for example  china s economy has been growing at a fast pace over the past several years  and the chinese government introduced various measures to slow down the pace of economic growth 
a decline in economic conditions in china could lead to declining worldwide economic conditions 
if economic conditions decline  whether in china or worldwide  we could be materially adversely affected 
the occurrence and threat of terrorist attacks and the consequences of sustained military action in the middle east have in the past  and may in the future  adversely affect demand for our products 
terrorist attacks may negatively affect our operations  directly or indirectly  and such attacks or related armed conflicts may directly impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers 
furthermore  these attacks may make travel and the transportation of our products more difficult and more expensive  which could materially adversely affect us 
the united states has been and may continue to be involved in armed conflicts that could have a further impact on our sales  and our supply chain 
political and economic instability in some regions of the world may also result and could negatively impact our business 
the consequences of armed conflicts are unpredictable  and we may not be able to foresee events that could have a material adverse effect on us 
more generally  any of these events could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the united states economy and worldwide financial markets 
any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on us and also may result in volatility of the market price for our securities 
unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect us 
as a result of our foreign operations  we have costs  assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies  primarily the euro 
for example  some fixed asset purchases and certain expenses of our german subsidiaries  amd saxony and amd fab kg  are denominated in euros while sales of products are denominated in us dollars 
as a consequence  movements in exchange rates could cause our euro denominated expenses to increase as a percentage of net sales  affecting our profitability and cash flows 
whenever we believe appropriate  we hedge a portion of our foreign currency exchange exposure to protect against fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
we determine our total foreign currency exchange exposure using projections of long term expenditures for items such as equipment and materials used in manufacturing 
we cannot assure you that these activities will be effective in reducing foreign exchange rate exposure 
failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 

table of contents our inability to effectively control the sales of our products on the gray market could have a material adverse effect on us 
we market and sell our products directly to oems and through authorized third party distributors 
from time to time  our products are diverted from our authorized distribution channels and are sold on the gray market 
gray market products entering the market result in shadow inventory that is not visible to us  thus making it difficult to forecast demand accurately 
also  when gray market products enter the market  we and our distribution channel compete with heavily discounted products  which adversely affects demand for our products 
in addition  our inability to control gray marketing activities could result in customer satisfaction issues  because any time products are purchased outside our authorized distribution channel  there is a risk that our customers are buying counterfeit or substandard products  including products that may have been altered  mishandled or damaged  or used products represented as new 
our inability to control sales of our products on the gray market could have a material adverse effect on us 
if we cannot adequately protect our technology or other intellectual property in the united states and abroad  through patents  copyrights  trade secrets  trademarks and other measures  we may lose a competitive advantage and incur significant expenses 
we rely on a combination of protections provided by contracts  including confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements  copyrights  patents  trademarks and common law rights  such as trade secrets  to protect our intellectual property 
however  we cannot assure you that we will be able to adequately protect our technology or other intellectual property from third party infringement or from misappropriation in the united states and abroad 
any patent licensed by us or issued to us could be challenged  invalidated or circumvented or rights granted thereunder may not provide a competitive advantage to us 
furthermore  patent applications that we file may not result in issuance of a patent or  if a patent is issued  the patent may not be issued in a form that is advantageous to us 
despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights  others may independently develop similar products  duplicate our products or design around our patents and other rights 
in addition  it is difficult to monitor compliance with  and enforce  our intellectual property on a worldwide basis in a cost effective manner 
foreign laws may provide less intellectual property protection than afforded in the united states 
if we cannot adequately protect our technology or other intellectual property in the united states and abroad  we would be materially adversely affected 
we are party to intellectual property litigation and may become a party to other intellectual property claims or litigation that could cause us to incur substantial costs or pay substantial damages or prohibit us from selling our products 
from time to time  we have been notified  or third parties may bring actions against us  based on allegations that we are infringing the intellectual property rights of others 
if any such claims are asserted against us  we may seek to obtain a license under the third party s intellectual property rights 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain all of the necessary licenses on satisfactory terms  if at all 
in the event that we cannot obtain a license  these parties may file lawsuits against us seeking damages potentially including treble damages or an injunction against the sale of our products that incorporate allegedly infringed intellectual property or against the operation of our business as presently conducted  which could result in our having to stop the sale of some of our products or to increase the costs of selling some of our products or could damage our reputation 
the award of damages  including material royalty payments  or the entry of an injunction against the manufacture and sale of some or all of our products  would have a material adverse effect on us 
we could decide  in the alternative  to redesign our products or to resort to litigation to challenge such claims 
such challenges could be extremely expensive and time consuming and could have a material adverse effect on us 
we cannot assure you that litigation related to the intellectual property rights of us and others can always be avoided or successfully concluded 

table of contents we are subject to a variety of environmental laws that could result in liabilities 
our operations and properties are subject to various us and foreign environmental laws and regulations  including those relating to materials used in our products and manufacturing processes  discharge of pollutants into the environment  the treatment  transport  storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes  and remediation of contamination 
these laws and regulations require us to obtain permits for our operations  including the discharge of air pollutants and wastewater 
our management systems are designed to maintain compliance 
however  we cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in complete compliance with such laws  regulations and permits 
if we violate or fail to comply with any of them  a range of consequences could result  including fines  suspension of production  alteration of manufacturing processes  import export restrictions  sales limitations  criminal and civil liabilities or other sanctions 
we could also be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of exposure to hazardous materials used  stored  released  disposed of by us or located at or under our facilities or other environmental or natural resource damage 
certain environmental laws  including the us comprehensive  environmental response  compensation and liability act of  or the superfund act  impose strict  joint and several liability on current and previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances and impose liability for damages to natural resources 
these laws often impose liability even if the owner or operator did not know of  or was not responsible for  the release of such hazardous substances 
these environmental laws also assess liability on persons who arrange for hazardous substances to be sent to disposal or treatment facilities when such facilities are found to be contaminated 
such persons can be responsible for cleanup costs even if they never owned or operated the contaminated facility 
we have been named as a responsible party on superfund clean up orders for three sites in sunnyvale  california 
although we have not yet been  we could be named a potentially responsible party at other superfund or contaminated sites in the future 
in addition  contamination that has not yet been identified could exist at our other facilities 
environmental laws are complex  change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time 
for example  the european union has enacted in recent years restrictions on the use of lead  among other chemicals  in electronic products  which affects semiconductor packaging 
other regulatory requirements potentially affecting our manufacturing processes and the design and marketing of our products are in development throughout the world 
while we have budgeted for foreseeable associated expenditures  we cannot assure you that future environmental legal requirements will not become more stringent or costly in the future 
therefore  we cannot assure you that our costs of complying with current and future environmental and health and safety laws  and our liabilities arising from past and future releases of  or exposure to  hazardous substances will not have a material adverse effect on us 
future litigation proceedings may materially adversely affect us 
from time to time we are a defendant or plaintiff in various legal actions 
litigation can involve complex factual and legal questions and its outcome is uncertain 
any claim that is successfully asserted against us may cause us to pay substantial damages 
in addition  future litigation may result in injunctions against future product sales 
even if we were to prevail  any litigation could be costly and time consuming and would divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations  which could have a material adverse effect on us 
our worldwide operations could be subject to natural disasters and other business disruptions  which could harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses 
our worldwide operations could be subject to natural disasters and other business disruptions  which could harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses 
for example  our corporate headquarters are located near major earthquake fault lines in california 
our assembly and test facilities are located in china  malaysia and singapore 
in the event of a major earthquake  or other natural or manmade disaster  we could experience loss of life of our employees  destruction of facilities or business interruptions  any of which could materially adversely affect us 

table of contents risks related to our ownership of spansion inc common stock spansion s financial position  results of operations and cash flows were consolidated with ours through december   but as a result of its initial public offering  we currently report our interest in spansion using the equity method of accounting 
we currently own  shares  or approximately percent  of spansion s outstanding common stock 
as a result  our percent share of spansion s net income loss will impact our net income loss 
the following risks and uncertainties that spansion faces could affect spansion s financial position or results of operations and correspondingly our financial position and results of operations 
these are not the only risks and uncertainties that spansion faces 
spansion also faces many of the risks and uncertainties that we face as described above in this risk factors section  as well as those set forth in spansion s registration statement on form s  as amended  and other sec filings  to which we refer you 
the demand for spansion s products depends in part on continued growth in the industries and geographies into which they are sold 
a market decline in any of these industries or geographies would have a material adverse effect on spansion s results of operations 
spansion is dependent to a large degree upon demand for mobile telephones  consumer electronics such as set top boxes and dvd players  automotive electronics  industrial electronics such as networking equipment  and pc peripheral equipment such as printers 
sales of spansion products also depend on oems including increasing amounts of nor flash memory content in their products 
in and  demand from the wireless category of the flash memory market drove a majority of spansion s sales 
if demand for these products  or nor flash memory content in these products  is below spansion s expectations  or if the functionality of successive generations of these products does not require increasing nor flash memory density  spansion would be materially adversely affected 
spansion has lost  and will continue to lose  rights to key intellectual property arrangements once it is no longer a beneficiary of our patent cross license agreements and other licenses  which creates a greatly increased risk of patent or other intellectual property infringement claims against spansion 
as a majority owned subsidiary  spansion had been the beneficiary of our intellectual property arrangements with third parties  including patent cross license agreements with other major semiconductor companies such as intel  motorola and ibm  and licenses from third parties for technology incorporated in spansion s products and software used to operate its business 
following spansion s initial public offering  it was no longer a beneficiary under a number of those agreements 
as a result  it lost rights to use important intellectual property that it was previously licensed to use and may therefore be subject to claims that it is infringing intellectual property rights of third parties through the manufacture and sale of its products and the operation of its business 
therefore  absent negotiating its own license agreements with third parties who own such intellectual property  spansion will be vulnerable to claims by such parties that its products or operations infringe such parties patents or other intellectual property rights 
in addition  third parties may have refrained from asserting intellectual property infringement claims against spansion because it had been a majority owned subsidiary of ours 
in addition  we believe that spansion will lose additional rights under our patent cross license agreements and other licenses once we no longer hold a majority of spansion s shares entitled to vote for the election of spansion s directors  assuming we are still party to such agreements and licenses at such time 
the parties to these agreements and licenses  and other third parties with whom we had no prior intellectual property arrangement  may file lawsuits against spansion seeking damages potentially including treble damages or an injunction against the sale of spansion s products that incorporate allegedly infringed intellectual property or against the operation of spansion s business as presently conducted 
such litigation could be extremely expensive 
the award of material damages  including material royalty payments  or the entry of an injunction  would have a material adverse effect on spansion 
a lack of market acceptance of mirrorbit technology could have a material adverse effect on spansion 
market acceptance of products based on spansion s mirrorbit technology is a critical factor impacting spansion s ability to increase revenues and market share as well as to enter new markets 
mirrorbit technology is 
table of contents a memory cell architecture that enables flash memory products to store two bits of data in a single memory cell thereby doubling the density or storage capacity of each memory cell 
if adoption of spansion s mirrorbit technology occurs at a slower rate than spansion anticipates  spansion s ability to compete will be reduced  and spansion would be materially adversely affected 
if spansion does not achieve market acceptance of products incorporating this technology  spansion would be materially adversely affected 
spansion flash memory products are based on nor architecture  and a significant market shift to nand architecture could materially adversely affect spansion 
flash memory products are generally based either on nor architecture or nand architecture 
to date  spansion s flash memory products have been based on nor architecture  which are typically produced at a higher cost per bit than nand based products 
spansion does not currently manufacture products based on nand architecture 
from through  industry sales of nand based products grew at higher rates than sales of nor based products  resulting in nand vendors in aggregate gaining a greater share of the overall flash memory market and nor vendors in aggregate losing overall market share 
in fact  in  sales of nand based flash memory products represented a majority of the flash memory products sold in the overall flash memory market 
moreover  the removable storage category of the flash memory market  which is currently the second largest category after wireless  and is predominantly served by nand vendors  is expected to be the fastest growing portion of the flash memory market for the foreseeable future 
as mobile phones and other consumer electronics become more advanced  they will require higher density flash memory to meet the increased data storage requirements associated with music downloads  photos and videos 
because storage requirements will increase to accommodate data intensive applications  oems may increasingly choose nand based products over nor based products for their applications 
moreover  some nand vendors are manufacturing on millimeter wafers or are utilizing more advanced manufacturing process technologies than spansion is today  which results in an ability to offer products with a lower cost per bit at a given product density 
if nand vendors continue to increase their share of the flash memory market  spansion s market share may decrease  which would materially adversely affect spansion 
if spansion fails to successfully develop products based on its new ornand architecture  or if there is a lack of market acceptance of products based on its ornand architecture  spansion s future operating results would be materially adversely affected 
as mobile phones become more advanced  they will require higher density flash memory to meet increased data storage requirements 
spansion has stated its intention to position itself to address the increasing demand for higher density flash memory within the wireless category of the flash memory market by offering products based on its ornand architecture  which spansion has recently introduced 
the success of its ornand architecture requires that spansion timely and cost effectively develop  manufacture and market ornand based products that are competitive with nand based flash memory products in the wireless category of the flash memory market 
if spansion fails to develop and commercialize its ornand architecture on a timely basis or if spansion s ornand based products fail to achieve acceptance in the wireless market  spansion s operating results would be materially adversely affected 
the loss of a significant mobile phone customer may have a material adverse effect on spansion 
sales of spansion products are dependent to a large extent on demand for mobile phones 
historically  a small number of customers in the wireless category have driven a substantial portion of net sales 
if one of these customers decided to stop buying spansion s products  or if one of these customers were materially to reduce its operations or its demand for spansion s products  spansion would be materially adversely affected 

table of contents spansion has a substantial amount of indebtedness which could materially adversely affect its financial condition 
spansion has a substantial amount of indebtedness 
this substantial indebtedness may require spansion to use a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to make debt service payments  make it difficult for spansion to satisfy its financial obligations  limit spansion s ability to use its cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or other general corporate purposes  limit spansion s flexibility to plan for  or react to  changes in its business and industry  place spansion at a competitive disadvantage compared to its less leveraged competitors  and increase spansion s vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions 
if spansion cannot generate sufficient operating cash flow and obtain external financing  it may be unable to make all of its planned capital expenditures 
spansion s ability to fund anticipated capital expenditures depends on generating sufficient cash flow from operations and the availability of external financing  which may not be available on favorable terms  if at all 
spansion s capital expenditures  together with ongoing operating expenses  will be a substantial drain on spansion s cash flow and may decrease its cash balances 
spansion s inability to obtain needed financing or to generate sufficient cash from operations may require it to abandon projects or curtail capital expenditures 
however  if it cannot generate sufficient operating cash flow or obtain external financing  spansion may be delayed in achieving such capacity  and spansion would be materially adversely affected 
spansion s business has been characterized by average selling prices that decline over relatively short time periods  which can negatively affect spansion s results of operations unless it is able to reduce its costs or introduce new products with higher average selling prices 
average selling prices for spansion s products historically have declined over relatively short time periods 
spansion is unable to predict pricing conditions for future periods 
even in the absence of downturns or oversupply in the industry  average selling prices of spansion s products have decreased during the products lives 
when spansion s average selling prices decline  its net sales and net income decline unless it is able to compensate by selling more units  reducing its manufacturing costs or introducing new  higher margin products that have higher densities and or incorporate advanced features 
if spansion s average selling prices continue to decline  its operating results could be materially adversely affected 
if spansion s cost reduction efforts are not effective  spansion could be materially adversely affected 
spansion is undertaking a number of actions in an effort to significantly reduce its expenses 
these actions include streamlining operations and continuing to align manufacturing utilization to the level of demand for spansion products  controlling increasing testing costs and working with us and fujitsu to reduce costs under services agreements 
we cannot assure you that any of these actions will occur as anticipated or at all  or that spansion will be able to achieve significant cost reductions 
if spansion s cost reduction efforts are unsuccessful  spansion would be materially adversely affected 
manufacturing capacity constraints may have a material adverse affect on spansion 
there may be situations in which spansion s manufacturing facilities are inadequate to meet the demand for certain of spansion s products 
spansion s inability to obtain sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet demand  either in its own facilities or through foundry or similar arrangements with third parties  could have a material 
table of contents adverse effect on spansion 
for example  in the first half of  spansion was not able to meet demand for certain of its lower density embedded flash memory products because in it underestimated demand for these products  and was unable to install additional wafer fabrication capacity on a timely basis 
spansion has stated its belief that this adversely impacted its relationships with customers who received reduced allocations  or did not receive allocations  of its embedded products  and spansion has stated its belief that its competitors were able to take advantage of this situation to increase their market share 
more recently  in the third quarter of  spansion experienced capacity constraints for final test and assembly of certain products 
while spansion is working internally and with subcontractors to realign and increase capacity to meet anticipated demand  spansion does not expect to be able to do so in the short term 
these capacity constraints limit spansion s ability to respond to rapid and short term surges in demand for its products 
spansion s inability to obtain sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet demand  either in its own facility or through foundry  subcontractor or similar arrangements with third parties  could have a material adverse effect on spansion 
spansion is party to intellectual property litigation and may become party to other intellectual property claims or litigation that could cause it to incur substantial costs or pay substantial damages or prohibit it from selling its products 
tessera  inc filed a lawsuit against spansion alleging that it has infringed certain of tessera s patents 
tessera has sought to enjoin such alleged infringement and to recover an unspecified amount of damages 
in addition  fujitsu has informed spansion that it has been informed by texas instruments that texas instruments believes that several of spansion s products infringe some of texas instruments patents 
fujitsu has also informed spansion that it expects spansion to defend and indemnify fujitsu against texas instruments claims in accordance with the terms of spansion s distribution agreement with fujitsu 
defending these claims and similar claims could be extremely expensive and time consuming for spansion  and defending these claims or others or the award of damages or an injunction could have a material adverse effect on spansion 
intense competition in the flash memory market could materially adversely affect spansion 
spansion s principal competitors in the flash memory market are intel corporation  samsung electronics co  ltd  stmicroelectronics  silicon storage technology  inc  macronix international co  ltd  toshiba corporation  sharp electronics corp 
and renesas technology corp 
and may also include the joint venture between intel and micron technology  inc the principal bases of competition in the flash memory market are cost  selling price  performance  quality and customer relationships 
in particular  in the past  spansion s competitors have aggressively priced their products in order to increase market share  which resulted in decreased average selling prices for spansion s products and adversely impacted spansion s results of operations 
in addition  recent capital investments by competitors have resulted in substantial industry manufacturing capacity  which may further contribute to a competitive pricing environment 
also  spansion and certain of its competitors have licensed flash memory technology called nrom technology from a third party 
nrom technology has similar characteristics to spansion s mirrorbit technology which may allow these competitors to develop new flash memory technology that is competitive with spansion s mirrorbit technology 
spansion may not be able to compete effectively if it fails to reduce its manufacturing costs and develop  introduce and sell on a timely basis  new products or enhanced versions of existing products at competitive prices 
if spansion is unable to timely and efficiently implement millimeter wafer capacity for the manufacture of its flash memory products  spansion could be materially adversely affected 
spansion has stated its intention to develop manufacturing capacity on millimeter wafers for its flash memory products 
the timing for implementing millimeter capacity will depend in part on the demand for 
table of contents spansion s flash memory products and the ability to fund the construction of such a facility if spansion chooses to develop capacity internally 
if spansion is delayed in having this capacity or is unable to timely and efficiently ramp production on millimeter wafers  spansion would not achieve anticipated cost savings and capacity associated with this technology  and spansion could be materially adversely affected 
if essential equipment or materials are not available to manufacture spansion s products  spansion could be materially adversely affected 
spansion s manufacturing operations depend upon obtaining deliveries of equipment and adequate supplies of materials on a timely basis 
from time to time  suppliers may extend lead times  limit supply to spansion or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors 
because the equipment that spansion purchases is complex  it is difficult for it to substitute one supplier for another or one piece of equipment for another 
certain raw materials spansion uses in manufacturing its products are available from a limited number of suppliers 
for example  spansion purchases commercial memory die  such as sram  psram  psdram and nand from third party suppliers and incorporates these die into its multi chip package products 
spansion s production of flash memory products was constrained in the first half of because of difficulties in procuring adequate supply of psram 
some of spansion s major suppliers  including samsung  are also its competitors in the flash memory market 
interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry could cause shortages and price increases in various essential materials 
if spansion is unable to procure certain of these materials  spansion may have to reduce its manufacturing operations 
such a reduction has in the past and could in the future have a material adverse effect on spansion 
if the market value of our shares of spansion common stock remains below our book value of such shares for an extended period of time  then our results of operations may be adversely affected 
if the market value of our shares of spansion common stock remains below our book value of such shares and the decline in the market value level is deemed other than temporary  then we may be required to take an impairment charge in the amount of the difference between the book value and the market value 
for the quarter in which we took any such impairment charge  our results of operations could be adversely affected by the amount of such impairment charge 
in addition  the carrying value of our investment in spansion on our balance sheet would also be reduced 
therefore  sustained decreases in the market price of spansion s common stock could have an adverse effect on us and our results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
in order to reduce this interest rate risk  we usually invest our cash in investments with short maturities 
as of december   substantially all of our investments in our portfolio were short term investments and consisted primarily of bank notes  short term corporate notes  short term money market auction rate preferred stocks and short term federal agency notes 
the majority of our debt obligations are fixed rate and long term 
we continually monitor market conditions and enter into hedges when appropriate 
we do not currently have any hedges of interest rate risk in place 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
default risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in only the highest credit quality securities and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
the portfolio includes marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
we are averse to principal loss and ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk and market risk 

table of contents on december   spansion llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of spansion inc  issued to us million aggregate principal amount of the spansion senior notes 
we purchased the spansion senior notes for approximately million in cash  at percent of face value 
the spansion senior notes are general unsecured obligations of spansion llc and will rank junior to any existing and future senior debt of spansion inc  or spansion llc 
interest is payable on april and october of each year beginning april  until the maturity date of april  spansion llc s obligations under the spansion senior notes are guaranteed by spansion inc  spansion technology inc  a subsidiary of spansion inc  and any restricted subsidiary of spansion that guarantees any of spansion s public debt in the future 
because we can sell these notes to a third party in a private transaction  and we intend to sell them in  we classified these notes as short term investments 
the spansion senior notes are not investment grade  and represent an exception to the general policy set forth above 
we use proceeds from debt obligations primarily to support general corporate purposes  including capital expenditures and working capital needs

as of december   as a result of our foreign operations  we have costs  assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies  primarily the euro 
for example  some fixed asset purchases and certain expenses of our german subsidiaries  amd saxony and amd fab kg  are denominated in euros while sales of products are denominated in us dollars 
as a consequence  movements in exchange rates could cause our euro denominated expenses to increase as a percentage of net sales  affecting our profitability and cash flows 
we use foreign currency forward and option 
table of contents contracts to reduce our exposure to currency fluctuations on our foreign currency exposures 
the objective of these contracts is to minimize the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating results and on the cost of capital asset acquisitions 
our accounting policy for these instruments is based on our designation of such instruments as hedges of underlying exposure to variability in cash flows 
we do not use these contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
as of december   we had an aggregate of million notional amount of short term foreign currency forward contracts and purchased call option contracts denominated in euro outstanding 
commencing from december   we changed the functional currency for our german subsidiaries  amd saxony and amd fab kg  from the euro to the us dollar 
therefore  from and for the foreseeable future  all of our subsidiaries will use the us dollar as their functional currency 
the change in the functional currency of these subsidiaries is in accordance with sfas  foreign currency translation  sfas and reflects the changed economic facts and circumstances pertaining to these subsidiaries 
under the requirements of sfas  we assessed the various economic factors relating to amd saxony and amd fab kg and concluded that due to changes in facts  circumstances  scope of operations and business practices  the us dollar is now the currency of the primary economic environment in which these subsidiaries operate 
however  locally incurred expenses of these subsidiaries will continue to be denominated in euro  and unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations would cause our euro denominated expenses to increase as a percentage of net sales  thereby adversely affecting our profitability and cash flow 
we will continue to monitor and to hedge this foreign risk exposure 
in addition  as a result of the spansion ipo  as of december   we no longer have any foreign exchange risk related to japanese yen  and approximately million of spansion s debt to third parties  which was mostly variable rate  was deconsolidated from our financial position 
during the time that spansion s results of operations were consolidated with our results of operations  we had sales  costs  assets and liabilities that were denominated in japanese yen 
for example  sales of spansion flash memory products in japan were denominated in yen and certain manufacturing costs related to spansion flash memory products were denominated in yen 
unrealized gains and losses related to the foreign currency forward and option contracts for the year ended december  were not material 
we do not anticipate any material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows resulting from the use of these instruments in the future 
however  we cannot give any assurance that these strategies will be effective or that transaction losses can be minimized or forecasted accurately 
in particular  generally  we hedge only a portion of our foreign currency exchange exposure 
moreover  we determine our total foreign currency exchange exposure using projections of long term expenditures for items such as equipment and materials used in manufacturing 
we cannot assure you that our hedging activities will eliminate foreign exchange rate exposure 
failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flow
