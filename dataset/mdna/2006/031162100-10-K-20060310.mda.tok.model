item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes for further information regarding our consolidated results of operations and financial position for periods reported therein and for known factors that will impact comparability of future results 
we began recording enbrel sales subsequent to our acquisition of immunex corporation in july included in operating expenses are acquisition charges of million  million  million  and million  in    and  respectively 
acquisition charges consist of the incremental compensation provided to certain employees under short term retention plans  including non cash compensation expense associated with stock options assumed in connection with the acquisition  non cash expense related to valuing the inventory acquired at fair value  and external  incremental consulting and systems integration costs directly associated with integrating the acquisition 
as part of the accounting for the tularik inc and immunex corporation acquisitions  we recorded a charge to write off acquired ipr d of million in and  million in  respectively 
the ipr d charge represents an estimate of the fair value of the in process research and development for projects and technologies that  as of the acquisition date  had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
in august  we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of tularik inc for a purchase price of approximately billion 
in july  we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of immunex corporation for a purchase price of approximately billion 
in march  we issued convertible notes with a face amount at maturity of billion 
holders of the convertible notes may require us to purchase all or a portion of the notes on specific dates  the earliest of which was march   at the accreted principal amount through the purchase dates 
on march   as a result of certain holders of the convertible notes exercising their march  put option  we repurchased billion  or approximately  of the outstanding convertible notes at their then accreted value for cash 
accordingly  the convertible notes repurchased were classified as current liabilities at december  holders of the remaining outstanding convertible notes may require us to purchase  generally for cash  all or a portion of the notes on various dates at a price equal to the accreted principal amount through the purchase date 
the next available put date was march   however  the holders of substantially all of the then outstanding convertible notes did not require us to repurchase such notes on this date 
the next date that the holders of these notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of these notes is on march  accordingly  as of december   the convertible notes have been classified as non current liabilities 
in november  we issued billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes due in and billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes due in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements this report and other documents we file with the securities and exchange commission sec contain forward looking statements that are based on current expectations  estimates  forecasts and projections about us  our future performance  our business or others on our behalf  our beliefs and our management s assumptions

overview the following management s discussion and analysis md a is intended to assist the reader in understanding amgen 
md a is provided as a supplement to  and should be read in conjunction with  our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we are a global biotechnology company that discovers  develops  manufactures  and markets human therapeutics based on advances in cellular and molecular biology 
our mission is to serve patients 
as a science based  patient focused organization  we discover and develop innovative therapies to treat grievous illness 
we operate in one business segment human therapeutics 
therefore  our results of operations are discussed on a consolidated basis 
we primarily earn revenues and income and generate cash from sales of human therapeutic products in the areas of inflammation  nephrology and supportive cancer care 
for the year ended december   total revenues were  million and net income was  million  or per share on a diluted basis 
as of december   cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled  million 
for the years ended december  and  product sales represented and of total revenues  respectively 
over the last several years  our product sales growth has been primarily driven by sales of aranesp darbepoetin alfa  enbrel etanercept  and neulasta pegfilgrastim  which have benefited from share gains and or market growth 
we expect these products to continue to drive year over year sales growth in the near term 
however  we expect that continued share gains will be more of a challenge than those achieved in previous years as we operate in a highly competitive environment 
see competition in item business for further information on the impact of competition on our business 
going forward  we will continue to focus on share gains  but we will also increase our focus on both growing and penetrating the therapeutic areas in which our products are used 
our principal products have attained significant sales levels  and for certain of our products  in a relatively short period of time 
as a result  although we have experienced significant year over year sales growth as a result of share gains and or market growth  in the near term  we expect our product sales growth to be lower than that achieved in the past several years 
most patients receiving our principal products for approved indications are covered by both government and private payer health care programs 
through  primary reimbursement for enbrel was obtained from private payers but  beginning in  enbrel and sensipar will be eligible for coverage from the us government under medicare program part d 
therefore  our principal product sales and sales growth are and will be affected by government and private payer reimbursement policies 
while we believe that our product sales were not significantly impacted by the reimbursement changes resulting from the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act or the medicare modernization act mma that went into effect in  additional provisions of the mma and other regulations affecting reimbursement that went into effect on january  could affect our product sales and related sales growth in the future 
however  we believe that such changes are not likely to be significant to our business in for additional information on reimbursement and its impact on our business  see reimbursement in item business 
international product sales for the years ended december  and represented and of total product sales and consisted principally of european sales 
international product sales have grown significantly over the last several years driven by aranesp and neulasta reflecting continued penetration 
however  we anticipate facing greater competition in europe from the availability of biosimilar products 
we expect that biosimilar erythropoietin products may be approved in the european union eu beginning in late and could be available in the eu shortly after approval which would compete with aranesp 
we also expect that the first biosimilar g csf product may be approved as early as mid and that it would compete with neulasta and neupogen filgrastim 
we cannot predict whether or to what extent the entry of biosimilar products would impact future aranesp  neulasta or neupogen sales in the eu 
see competition in item business for further information regarding biosimilar products 
in order to maintain commercial success in europe  we plan to continue to support the development of new standards of care and continue to actively convert neupogen patients to neulasta  emphasizing its less frequent dosing requirements as compared to neupogen 
our international product sales are impacted by foreign currency changes see results of operations discussion below 
international product sales growth during and benefited by million and million  respectively  from foreign currency exchange rate changes 
during  international product sales for the first three quarters of the year benefited from foreign currency exchange rate changes  but were adversely affected in the fourth quarter 
however  both the positive and negative impacts that movements in foreign exchange rates have on our international product sales are mitigated  in part  by the natural  opposite impact these exchange rate movements have on our international operating expenses and as a result of our foreign currency hedging activities 
our hedging activities seek to offset the impact  both positive and negative  that foreign exchange rate changes may have on our net income 
as such  the impact to our net results of operations from changes in foreign currency exchange rates has been largely mitigated 
for and  operating income increased  million and million over their respective prior year periods  primarily as a result of our product sales growth 
operating income as a percentage of product sales was for and for operating income for was impacted by the ipr d charge of million relating to the acquisition of tularik during see note  acquisitions in the consolidated financial statements 
during  we increased our operating expenses to advance our product pipeline and support our product sales growth 
during  selling  general and administrative sg a expenses as a percentage of product sales decreased from to as we leveraged our prior year sg a spending 
in  we expect our r d expenses to grow  principally as a result of significant increases in our clinical development activities discussed below 
to support this increased investment in our pipeline  sg a expenses in are expected to grow at a rate comparable to the growth rate 
as a result of the significant anticipated growth in r d expenses  we expect our operating expenses to grow at a higher rate than our anticipated product sales growth 
we focus our r d on novel human therapeutics for the treatment of grievous illness 
see research and development and selected product candidates in item business for further information on our r d vision and product pipeline 
in december  we signed a definitive merger agreement under which we will pay shareholders of abgenix  inc abgenix in cash per common share for a total value of approximately billion and will assume abgenix s outstanding debt 
abgenix is a company specializing in the discovery  development and manufacture of human therapeutic antibodies and is our co development partner for panitumumab 
the federal trade commission approved the merger on january  and we expect to close the merger  subject to abgenix shareholder approval  by april see joint ventures and business relationships abgenix  inc in item business for further information on the co development agreement with abgenix 
we have expanded and will need to continue to significantly expand our clinical development resources  including human capital  to manage and execute increasingly larger and more complex clinical trials 
in  we are expecting a significant increase in the number  size  duration and complexity of our clinical trials  in particular with respect to denosumab  our late stage investigational product for osteoporosis  and we expect total research and development expenses to increase by 
for example  testing denosumab in the osteoporosis setting requires large clinical trials  substantial time and resources to recruit patients and significant expense to execute 
we expect to start eleven mega site trials involving or more sites in to support denosumab and our other late stage programs 
to execute our clinical trial programs  we need to accelerate the growth of our development organization  implement new management structures and approaches and increase dependence on third party contract clinical trial providers 
further  to increase the number of patients available for enrollment for our clinical trials  we are planning to open clinical sites and enroll patients in a number of new geographic locations where our experience conducting clinical trials is more limited  including russia  china  india and some south american countries 
we plan to conduct clinical trial activities in these new territories through third party contract clinical trial providers 
there are many economic and industry wide factors that affect our business  including  among others  those relating to increased complexity and cost of r d  increasingly intense competition for our currently marketed products and product candidates  broad reimbursement changes  complex and expanding regulatory requirements  and intellectual property protection 
see item business and item a 
risk factors for further information on these economic and industry wide factors and their impact and potential impact on our business 
in addition to these economic and industry wide factors  we  as a company  face certain additional challenges and have a number of opportunities as well 
we have established leadership positions with all of our principal products  attaining significant sales levels  and for certain of our products  in a relatively short period of time 
as a result  we expect our product sales growth rates in the near term will be lower than those achieved in the past several years 
we expect increasing competition internationally as the first biosimilar products may be available in europe shortly after the anticipated approval in late and in the anemia area worldwide  as the related business opportunities are significant and growing 
we believe that future sales growth for certain of our principal products should benefit from increased penetration and market growth through new areas of treatment and or greater awareness 
further  over the last several years  our pipeline has substantially increased and with that comes the challenge of delivering on the pipeline  including executing on large and complex clinical trials 
our strategy to overcome these challenges and to be successful in taking advantage of our opportunities is straightforward 
we plan to focus solely on human therapeutics invest heavily in r d and be productive pursue organic growth supplemented by external investments and partnerships secure and defend our intellectual property hire and retain the best people in the near term  our objectives are straightforward as well 
we intend to balance short term financial performance with significant r d investment to drive long term growth 
we plan to grow our markets and hold or increase share 
we will continue to vigorously defend our intellectual property and plan to take steps to grow our anemia business 
we will continue to proactively manage and expand our production capacity ensuring that our commercial and clinical manufacturing is reliable and not subject to a single point failure 
as always  compliance with regulations and laws is of the utmost importance to us and we intend to sustain and enhance our very good compliance record 
lastly  remaining entrepreneurial  aggressive  and patient focused as we grow larger will enable us to fulfill these objectives and our mission to serve patients 
results of operations product sales for the years ended december    and  total product sales by geographic region were as follows amounts in millions change change total us total international total product sales 
product sales are influenced by a number of factors  including demand  third party reimbursement availability and policies  pricing strategies  wholesaler and end user inventory management practices  foreign exchange effects  new product launches and indications  competitive products  product supply  and acquisitions 
see principal products in item business for a discussion of our principal products and their approved indications 
sales growth in was principally driven by demand for aranesp  enbrel  and neulasta  which have benefited from share gains and or market growth 
international product sales growth benefited by million from foreign currency exchange rate changes 
during  the first three quarters of the year benefited from foreign currency exchange rate changes  but were adversely affected in the fourth quarter 
sales growth in was principally driven by demand for aranesp  enbrel  and neulasta 
us sales for aranesp and neulasta were impacted by higher incentives earned by customers under performance based contracts 
international product sales growth benefited by million from foreign currency exchange rate changes 
we expect aranesp  enbrel  and neulasta to continue to drive year over year sales growth in the near term 
however  we expect that continued share gains will be more of a challenge than those achieved in previous years as we operate in a highly competitive environment 
going forward  we will continue to focus on share gains  but we will also increase our focus on both growing and penetrating the therapeutic areas in which our products are used 
in  we believe that our product sales were not significantly impacted by the reimbursement changes resulting from the mma 
we believe this was  in part  due to the effects of cms s oncology demonstration project the demonstration project on sales of our products used in supportive cancer care  especially aranesp 
furthermore  we believe this was also  in part  due to increased reimbursement rates to physicians from cms for services associated with drug administration 
the demonstration project  which provided financial incentives to physicians for collecting and reporting oncology patient survey data  expired on december  in november  cms announced a new demonstration project the demonstration project that uses different criteria for how patients with cancer are evaluated and treated and that is targeted at approximately half of the funding originally targeted for the demonstration project 
the final rule for the medicare physician fee schedule payment final rule issued in november reduced payments for physician services in by approximately on average 
however recently passed legislation will eliminate this reduction for because we cannot accurately predict the impact of any such changes on how  or under what circumstances  healthcare providers will prescribe or administer our products  we cannot estimate the full impact of the mma on our business 
however  we believe that it is not likely to be significant to our business in for additional information on reimbursement and its impact on our business  see reimbursement in item business

sales growth for was slightly impacted by higher incentives earned by customers attaining higher sales volumes and growth under performance based contracts 
although the asps for us aranesp trended downward during  we believe that they began to stabilize during the fourth quarter of in  aranesp usage in us hospital dialysis clinics increased  reflecting a conversion from epogen epoetin alfa 
this conversion is expected to stabilize by mid international aranesp sales growth for was principally driven by demand  benefiting only slightly  million  from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the increase in us aranesp sales for the year ended december  was driven by demand  which benefited from share gains in both oncology and nephrology and market growth 
sales growth was impacted by higher incentives earned by customers attaining higher sales volumes and growth under performance based contracts 
the increase in international aranesp sales for the year ended december  was principally driven by demand  and to a lesser extent  favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
international aranesp sales growth for also benefited by million from foreign currency exchange rate changes 
for  we believe aranesp sales growth will be driven primarily by market growth and greater penetration from extended dosing 
however  we believe future worldwide aranesp sales growth will be dependent  in part  on such factors as reimbursement by third party payers including governments and private insurance plans see item a 
risk factors our sales depend on payment and reimbursement from third party payers  and  to the extent that reimbursement for our products is reduced  this could negatively impact the utilization of our products  cost containment pressures from governments and private insurers on health care providers  governmental or private organization regulations or guidelines relating to the use of our products  government programs such as the demonstration project  penetration of new and existing markets  patient population growth  the effects of pricing strategies  competitive products or therapies  including biosimilar products in europe  the development of new treatments for cancer  and changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
further  sales of aranesp have been and may continue to be benefited by its use in us hospital dialysis clinics to treat anemia associated with chronic renal failure instead of epogen 
this conversion is expected to stabilize by mid epogen change change amounts in millions epogen us epogen sales for the year ended december  decreased primarily due to lower demand  unfavorable changes in wholesaler inventory levels  and an unfavorable revised estimate of dialysis demand  primarily spillover  for prior quarters 
demand for was affected by conversion to aranesp in the us hospital dialysis clinics  which has represented approximately of the epogen business  and reflects higher sales incentives 
this conversion to aranesp is expected to stabilize by mid demand for epogen in the freestanding dialysis clinics remains consistent with patient population growth at approximately to 
spillover is a result of our contractual relationship with johnson johnson see summary of critical accounting policies epogen revenue recognition and note  summary of significant accounting policies product sales to the consolidated financial statements 
for the year ended december   the growth in reported epogen sales was primarily driven by demand  which reflects dialysis patient population growth and a continued focus in the renal community on patient outcomes  and to a lesser extent  increases in wholesaler inventory levels 
we believe epogen should experience sales growth in primarily as a result of patient population growth and the stabilization of conversion to aranesp in the us hospital dialysis clinics by mid patients receiving treatment for anemia associated with end stage renal disease with epogen are covered primarily under medical programs provided by the federal government 
therefore  we believe epogen sales growth will further depend on changes in reimbursement rates or a change in the basis for reimbursement by the federal government see item a 
risk factors our sales depend on payment and reimbursement from third party payers  and  to the extent that reimbursement for our products is reduced  this could negatively impact the utilization of our products 
we believe epogen sales growth will also be dependent  in part  on future governmental or private organization regulations or guidelines relating to the use of our products  cost containment pressures from the federal government on health care providers and the effects of pricing 
neulasta neupogen for the years ended december    and  total neulasta and neupogen filgrastim sales by geographic region were as follows amounts in millions change change neulasta us neupogen us us neulasta neupogen total neulasta international neupogen international international neulasta neupogen total total worldwide neulasta neupogen the increase in us neulasta neupogen sales for the year ended december  was driven primarily by demand for neulasta  which benefited from recent guidelines recommending earlier use 
us neulasta neupogen sales  neulasta in particular  also benefited from a label extension based on new clinical data demonstrating the value of first cycle use in moderate risk chemotherapy regimens 
in addition  us sales growth was slightly impacted by higher incentives earned by customers attaining higher sales volumes and growth under performance based contracts 
although the asps for us neulasta have trended downward during  we believe that they began to stabilize during the fourth quarter of the increase in international neulasta neupogen sales for the year ended december   was driven primarily by demand for neulasta 
international neulasta neupogen sales for also benefited by million from foreign currency exchange rate changes 
the increase in us neulasta neupogen sales for the year ended december  was primarily driven by demand for neulasta  which benefited from new clinical data demonstrating the value of first cycle use 
sales growth was impacted by higher incentives earned by customers attaining higher sales volumes and growth under performance based contracts 
the increase in international neulasta neupogen sales for the year ended december  was primarily due to demand for neulasta  which reflects continued market penetration since the january launch of neulasta in europe  and to a lesser extent  favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
international neulasta neupogen sales growth for benefited by million from favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we believe that sales growth for neulasta neupogen will be primarily driven by greater first cycle use due to increased awareness of febrile neutropenia 
however  future worldwide neulasta neupogen sales growth will be dependent  in part  on such factors as reimbursement by third party payers including governments and private insurance plans see item a 
risk factors our sales depend on payment and reimbursement from third party payers  and  to the extent that reimbursement for our products is reduced  this could negatively impact the utilization of our products  cost containment pressures from governments and private insurers on health care providers  governmental or private organization regulations or guidelines relating to the use of our products  government programs such as the demonstration project  penetration of existing markets  patient population growth  the effects of pricing strategies  competitive products or therapies  including follow on biologic products in europe  the development of new treatments for cancer  and changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
future chemotherapy treatments that are less myelosuppressive may require less neulasta neupogen  however  other future chemotherapy treatments that are more myelosuppressive  such as dose dense chemotherapy  could require more neulasta neupogen 
neupogen competes with neulasta in the united states and europe 
us neupogen sales have been adversely impacted by conversion to neulasta 
however  we believe that most of the conversion in the united states has occurred 
in europe  we plan to continue actively converting neupogen patients to neulasta  emphasizing its less frequent dosing requirements as compared to neupogen 
however  we cannot accurately predict the rate or timing of future conversion of neupogen patients to neulasta in europe 
enbrel for the years ended december    and  total enbrel sales by geographic region were as follows amounts in millions change change enbrel us enbrel international total enbrel enbrel sales growth for the years ended december  and was driven by demand  reflecting strong growth in both rheumatology and dermatology 
enbrel sales growth has benefited from its competitive profile and significant growth of biologics in both the rheumatology and dermatology settings 
in dermatology  enbrel has grown significantly since its approval for moderate to severe psoriasis in april of and is the number one prescribed systemic therapy in this area 
we believe sales growth will be driven by increased penetration in both the rheumatology and dermatology settings and as a result of enbrel being eligible for coverage from the us government under medicare program part d beginning in however  future enbrel sales growth will be dependent  in part  on such factors as the effects of competing products or therapies  penetration of existing and new markets  including potential new indications  the availability and extent of reimbursement by government and third party payers  and governmental or private organization regulations or guidelines relating to the use of our products see item a

cost of sales as a percentage of sales for is expected to be comparable to cost of sales for the year ended december   increased primarily driven by higher sales volumes  and to a lesser extent  higher manufacturing costs due to changes in the product mix 
research and development r d expenses are primarily comprised of salaries and benefits associated with r d personnel  overhead and occupancy costs  clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing costs  contract services  and other outside costs 
r d expenses increased for the year ended december   primarily driven by higher staff related costs  which included the full year integration of the tularik operations and the buildup of our r d organization to support the growth in our pipeline 
the growth also reflects higher costs relating to key clinical trials and clinical manufacturing  including the continued ramp up of large scale phase trials for denosumab formally known as amg  amgen s investigational therapy for bone loss 
in  staff related costs and clinical trial and clinical manufacturing costs increased approximately million and million  respectively 
in  we expect our total r d expenses to increase primarily due to higher staff related costs and a significant increase in clinical trial and clinical manufacturing costs 
staff related costs are expected to increase due to a significant increase in personnel throughout clinical trial and clinical manufacturing costs are expected to increase due to several large ongoing late stage clinical trials initiated in as well as additional planned trials for these include trials in denosumab  panitumumab  amg  aranesp  sensipar  and enbrel see item business research and development and selected product candidates 
our expected increase in r d costs for does not include any incremental r d costs associated with the proposed acquisition of abgenix see item business joint ventures and business relationships abgenix  inc in  r d expenses increased over the prior year  primarily driven by higher staff related costs including the addition of r d personnel from tularik  and to a lesser extent  higher costs relating to clinical manufacturing and key clinical trials costs  including the commencement of large scale phase trials for amg  amgen s investigational therapy for bone loss 
in  staff related costs and clinical manufacturing and clinical trial costs increased approximately million and million  respectively 
acquired in process research and development ipr d represents an estimate of the fair value of the various r d projects and technologies in the acquired company s pipeline that  as of the acquisition date  had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
in  we incurred a charge of million  associated with writing off the fair value of ipr d acquired in the tularik acquisition see note  acquisitions in the consolidated financial statements 
assuming successful completion of the proposed acquisition of abgenix expected to close by april  we would expect to incur a charge for ipr d

selling  general and administrative sg a expenses are primarily comprised of salaries and benefits associated with sales and marketing  finance  legal  and other administrative personnel  outside marketing expenses  overhead and occupancy costs  and other general and administrative costs 
sg a increased for the year ended december   primarily due to higher outside marketing expenses in support of our principal products 
outside marketing expenses include the wyeth profit share related to enbrel  which has increased due to enbrel sales growth 
in  outside marketing expenses and staff related costs increased approximately million and million  respectively 
during  sg a as a percentage of sales decreased from to as we leveraged our prior year sg a spending 
in  we expect higher wyeth profit share expense due to expected enbrel sales growth 
however  total sg a expense growth for is expected to be comparable to growth to allow greater investment in the pipeline 
in  sg a increased for the year ended december   primarily due to higher staff related costs and higher outside marketing expenses  which reflects higher spending to support our products in competitive markets and sales growth

see note  other items  net  to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
income taxes our effective tax rate was   and for   and respectively 
our effective tax rate for has decreased primarily due to favorable resolution of prior year foreign tax credit claims and research and development tax credits with the internal revenue service irs  and the absence of the write off of non deductible ipr d costs in connection with the acquisition of tularik in this decrease was partially offset by the tax on the repatriation of foreign earnings in under the american jobs creation act of the effective tax rate was higher than the effective tax rate due to the write off of non deductible ipr d costs of million in connection with the acquisition of tularik 
this increase was partially offset by an increase in the amount of foreign earnings intended to be invested indefinitely outside of the united states 
as permitted in accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for income taxes special areas  we do not provide us income taxes on our controlled foreign corporations undistributed earnings that are intended to be invested indefinitely outside the united states 
on october   the president of the united states signed the american jobs creation act  which provided a temporary incentive to repatriate undistributed foreign earnings 
one provision of the american jobs creation act effectively reduced the tax rate by providing an dividend received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations 
in the fourth quarter of  we repatriated million of foreign earnings  which was the maximum amount of foreign earnings qualifying for the reduced tax rate 
the tax expense incurred on the repatriation was approximately million

stock option expense in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
r  share based payment 
subsequently  the securities and exchange commission sec provided for a phase in implementation process for sfas no 
r  which required us to adopt the new accounting standard no later than january  sfas no 
r requires us to account for our stock options using a fair value based method as described in such statement and recognize the resulting compensation expense in our financial statements 
prior to january   we accounted for our employee stock options using the intrinsic value method under apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations  which generally results in no employee stock option expense 
we adopted sfas no 
r on january  and do not plan to restate our financial statements for prior periods 
we plan to continue to use the black scholes option valuation model in estimating the fair value of the stock option awards issued under sfas no 
r 
the adoption of sfas no 
r will have a material impact on our results of operations 
the actual annual stock option expense in is dependent on a number of factors including the number of stock options granted  our common stock price and related expected volatility  and other inputs utilized in estimating the fair value of the stock options at the time of grant 
we expect the impact of stock option compensation expense to be in the range of to per share in compared to for see note  summary of significant accounting policies employee stock options in the consolidated financial statements 
the estimated impact of stock option expense for is less than the corresponding pro forma expense amount for principally due to a reduction in the estimated number of stock options to be granted in in favor of a combination of other equity awards 
other equity awards are comprised of restricted stock  restricted stock units  and performance units 
stock based compensation expense relating to these other equity awards for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
for the year ended december   stock based compensation expense relating to other equity awards was not significant 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources the following table summarizes selected financial data amounts in millions december  december  cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities total assets current debt non current debt stockholders equity we believe that existing funds  cash generated from operations  and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our working capital  capital expenditure and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future  as well as to support our stock repurchase programs and other business initiatives  including acquisitions and licensing activities see item business joint ventures and business relationships abgenix  inc for further discussion regarding the proposed abgenix acquisition 
however  in order to provide for greater financial flexibility and liquidity  we may raise additional capital from time to time by accessing both public and private markets 
see financing arrangements for a discussion regarding february financing activities 
cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities of the total cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities at december   approximately billion was generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions and is intended for use outside the united states 
if these funds are repatriated for use in our us operations  additional taxes on certain of these amounts would be required to be paid 
in the fourth quarter of  we repatriated million of foreign earnings  which was the maximum amount of foreign earnings qualifying for the reduced tax rate under the american jobs act 
the repatriation of these funds resulted in an increase in our tax provision of million 
the primary objectives for our marketable securities portfolio  which is primarily comprised of fixed income investments  are liquidity and safety of principal 
investments are made with the objective of achieving the highest rate of return  consistent with these two objectives 
our investment policy limits investments to certain types of instruments issued by institutions primarily with investment grade credit ratings and places restrictions on maturities and concentration by type and issuer 
financing arrangements as of december  we had convertible notes year  zero coupon convertible notes with an accreted value of billion outstanding and having an aggregate face amount of billion and yield to maturity of convertible notes

under the million shelf  all of the remaining million of debt securities available for issuance may be offered from time to time under our medium term note program with terms to be determined at the time of issuance 
in february  we issued billion principal amount of convertible notes due in the convertible notes and billion principal amount of convertible notes due in the convertible notes in a private placement 
the convertible notes and the convertible notes were issued at par and pay interest at a rate of and  respectively 
the convertible notes and the convertible notes may be convertible based on an initial conversion rate of shares and shares  respectively  per  principal amount of notes which represents an initial conversion price of approximately and per share  respectively 
the convertible notes and the convertible notes may only be converted during any calendar quarter beginning after june  if the closing price of our common stock exceeds of the respective conversion price per share during a defined period at the end of the previous quarter  if we make specified distributions to holders of our common stock or specified corporate transactions occur  or one month prior to the respective maturity date 
upon conversion  a holder would receive cash equal to the lesser of the principal amount of the note or the conversion value  as defined  and to the extent the conversion value exceeds the principal amount of the note  shares of our common stock  cash  or a combination of common stock and cash  at our option the excess conversion value 
in addition  upon a change in control  as defined  the holders may require us to purchase for cash all or a portion of their notes for of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any 
a total of billion of the net proceeds from these debt issuances were used to repurchase common stock under our stock repurchase program 
concurrent with the issuance of the convertible notes and the convertible notes  we purchased convertible note hedges in private transactions 
the convertible note hedges allow us to receive shares of our common stock and or cash from the counterparties to the transactions equal to the amounts of common stock and or cash related to the excess conversion value that we would pay to the holders of the convertible notes and the convertible notes upon conversion 
these transactions will terminate the earlier of the maturity dates of the related notes or the first day none of the related notes remain outstanding due to conversion or otherwise 
the convertible note hedges  which cost an aggregate of approximately billion  will be recorded as a reduction of equity 
also concurrent with the issuance of the convertible notes and the convertible notes  we sold warrants to acquire shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share in a private placement 
pursuant to these transactions  warrants for million shares of our common stock may be settled in may and warrants for million shares of our common stock may be settled in may the settlement dates 
if the average price of our common stock during a defined period ending on or about the respective settlement dates exceeds the exercise price of the warrants  the warrants will be settled  at our option  in cash or shares of our common stock 
proceeds received from the issuance of the warrants totaled approximately million 
we have a billion unsecured revolving credit facility to be used for general corporate purposes  including commercial paper support  which matures in november additionally  we have a commercial paper program  which provides for unsecured  short term borrowings of up to an aggregate of billion

as of december   no securities had been issued under the billion shelf 
certain of our financing arrangements contain non financial covenants and as of december   we are in compliance with all applicable covenants 
cash flows the following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the years ended december    and amounts in millions net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities operating cash provided by operating activities has been and is expected to continue to be our primary recurring source of funds 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities during the year ended december  resulted primarily from higher cash receipts from customers driven by the growth in product sales and timing differences of cash payments relating to our tax and other accrued liabilities see consolidated statements of cash flows 
the increase in cash provided by operations for resulted primarily from higher cash receipts from customers driven by growth in product sales 
this increase was partially offset primarily by the timing of cash payments related to our tax liabilities see consolidated statements of cash flows 
investing capital expenditures totaled million in compared with billion in and billion in capital expenditures in primarily related to the puerto rico manufacturing expansion which included a new manufacturing plant for the commercial production of neulasta and neupogen approved by the fda in september  thousand oaks site expansion  colorado manufacturing expansion  and site development to support the new enbrel manufacturing plant in rhode island  also approved by the fda in september capital expenditures in primarily related to the thousand oaks site expansion  the new enbrel manufacturing plant in rhode island  and the puerto rico manufacturing expansion 
capital expenditures in related to the new enbrel manufacturing plant in rhode island  the puerto rico manufacturing expansion  and the seattle research center which was completed in january we currently estimate spending on capital projects and equipment to be in excess of billion as we continue to increase our manufacturing and r d operations globally 
the most significant of these expenditures are expected to be incurred with the start of engineering and construction of a new process development  bulk manufacturing and formulation  fill  and finish facility in ireland  the further expansion of the puerto rico bulk manufacturing  formulation  fill  and finish facilities  the expansion of r d operations at existing sites in the united states and the united kingdom and the construction of a new development center in uxbridge  united kingdom

in addition  we expect to spend approximately billion by the end of april  in conjunction with our proposed acquisition of abgenix 
we will also assume abgenix s debt in connection with this proposed transaction 
financing in december  the board of directors the board authorized us to repurchase up to billion of common stock 
additionally  in december  the board authorized us to repurchase up to an additional billion of common stock 
as of december   billion was available for stock repurchases under these programs 
the manner of purchases  amount we spend  and the number of shares repurchased will vary based on a variety of factors including the stock price and blackout periods in which we are restricted from repurchasing shares  and may include private block purchases as well as market transactions 
repurchases under our stock repurchase programs reflect  in part  our confidence in the long term value of amgen common stock 
additionally  we believe that it is an effective way of returning cash to our stockholders

we receive cash from the exercise of employee stock options and proceeds from the sale of stock pursuant to the employee stock purchase plan 
employee stock option exercises and proceeds from the sale of stock by us pursuant to the employee stock purchase plans provided billion  million  and million of cash during the years ended december    and respectively 
proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options will vary from period to period based upon  among other factors  fluctuations in the market value of our stock relative to the exercise price of such options 
in november  we issued billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes due and billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes due the net proceeds totaled  million and were intended for purchases of stock under the stock repurchase program then in affect and for general corporate purposes  including capital expenditures and working capital

off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that are currently material or reasonably likely to be material to our financial position or results of operations 
contractual obligations contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties  and exclude contingent liabilities for which we cannot reasonably predict future payment 
accordingly  the table below excludes contractual obligations relating to milestone and royalty payments due to third parties and purchase price consideration for proposed mergers and acquisitions see item business joint ventures and business relationships abgenix  inc  all of which are contingent upon certain future events 
such events could include  but are not limited to  development milestones  regulatory approvals  product sales  and shareholder approval for proposed transactions 
additionally  the expected timing of payment of the obligations presented below is estimated based on current information 
timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed upon terms or amounts for some obligations 
the following chart represents our contractual obligations as of december   aggregated by type in millions payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total contractual obligations the long term obligation amounts in the above table differ from the related carrying amounts on the consolidated balance sheet as of december  due to the accretion of the original issue discount on the convertible notes and the inclusion of future interest payments 
future interest payments are included on the notes  the notes  the notes  and the century notes at fixed rates of    and  respectively  through maturity in    and  respectively 
holders of the convertible notes could have required us to purchase all or a portion of the notes on specific dates as early as march  at the original issuance price plus accrued original issue discount accreted value through the purchase dates 
however  the holders of substantially all of the convertible notes did not require us to repurchase such notes on this date 
consequently  the amounts above reflect the convertible notes accreted value on march   the next put date 
see note  financing arrangements to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the terms of the convertible notes 
purchase obligations primarily relate to our long term supply agreement with bi pharma for the manufacture of commercial quantities of enbrel  which are based on firm commitments for the purchase of production capacity for enbrel and reflect certain estimates such as production run success rates and bulk drug yields achieved  r d commitments including those related to clinical trials for new and existing products  capital expenditures for engineering and construction which primarily relate to the colorado manufacturing projects  thousand oaks research and development expansion and site development  rhode island site development  and certain ongoing puerto rico manufacturing projects  and open purchase orders for the acquisition of goods and services in the ordinary course of business 
our obligation to pay certain of these amounts may be reduced based on certain future events 
summary of critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements 
some of those judgments can be subjective and complex  and therefore  actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
product sales  sales incentives and returns sales of our products other than epogen see epogen revenue recognition below are recognized when shipped and title and risk of loss have passed 
this typically occurs at the time products are shipped to the customer  generally a wholesale distributor 
in the united states  we utilize these wholesalers as the principal means of distributing our products to healthcare providers such as clinics  hospitals  and pharmacies 
products we sell outside the united states are principally distributed to hospitals and or wholesalers depending upon the distribution practice in each country for which the product has been launched 
we monitor the inventory levels of our products at our wholesale distributors using third party data  and we believe that wholesaler inventories have been maintained at appropriate levels generally two to three weeks given end user demand 
accordingly  historical fluctuations in wholesaler inventory levels have not significantly impacted our method of estimating sales incentives and returns 
accruals for estimated rebates  wholesaler chargebacks  discounts  and other incentives collectively sales incentives are recorded in the same period that the related sales are recorded and are recognized as a reduction in product sales 
sales incentive accruals are based on reasonable estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales 
these estimates take into consideration current contractual and statutory requirements  specific known market events and trends  internal and external historical data  and forecasted customer buying patterns 
sales incentives are product specific and  therefore  for any given year  can be impacted by the mix of products sold 
reductions in product sales relating to sales incentives are comprised of the following amounts in millions rebates wholesaler chargebacks discounts and other incentives total sales incentives percent of gross product sales rebates earned by healthcare providers such as clinics  hospitals and pharmacies in the united states are the sales incentives that are most difficult to estimate 
these rebates are performance based offers that are primarily based on attaining contractually specified sales volumes and growth 
as a result  the calculation of the accrual for these rebates is complicated by the need to estimate customer buying patterns and the resulting applicable contractual rebate rate s to be earned over a contractual period 
these rebates totaled  million in   million in  and million in we believe that the methodology we use to accrue for rebates is reasonable and appropriate given current facts and circumstances 
however  actual results may differ 
for example  a change in the revenue reduction attributable to rebates recognized in would have had an approximate million effect on our reported product sales in wholesaler chargebacks are another type of arrangement included in sales incentives that relate to our contractual agreements to sell products to healthcare providers in the united states at fixed prices that are lower than the list prices we charge wholesalers 
when the healthcare providers purchase our products through wholesalers at these reduced prices  the wholesaler charges us for the difference between the prices they pay us and the prices they sold the products to the healthcare providers 
these chargebacks from wholesalers totaled  million in   million in  and million in accruals for wholesaler chargebacks are less difficult to estimate than rebates and closely approximate actual results since chargeback amounts are fixed at the date of purchase by the healthcare provider and we settle these deductions generally within a few weeks of incurring the liability 
amounts accrued for sales incentives are adjusted when trends or significant events indicate that adjustment is appropriate 
accruals are also adjusted to reflect actual results 
however  such adjustments to date have not been material to our results of operations or financial position 
the following table summarizes amounts recorded in accrued liabilities regarding sales incentives amounts in millions balance at beginning of period amounts charged against product sales payments balance at end of period year ended december  december  includes immaterial amounts related to prior year product sales based on changes in estimates 
such amounts represented approximately of incentive amounts charged against product sales for both and accruals for estimated sales returns are recorded in the same period that the related product sales are recorded and are recognized as reductions in product sales 
returns are estimated through comparison of historical return data to their related sales on a production lot basis 
historical rates of return are determined for each product and are adjusted for known or expected changes in the marketplace specific to each product when appropriate 
historically  sales returns have been insignificant  amounting to approximately of gross product sales 
epogen revenue recognition we have the exclusive right to sell epoetin alfa for dialysis  certain diagnostics  and all non human  non research uses in the united states 
we granted to johnson johnson a license relating to epoetin alfa for sales in the united states for all human uses except dialysis and diagnostics 
pursuant to this license  amgen and johnson johnson are required to compensate each other for epoetin alfa sales that either party makes into the other party s exclusive market  sometimes referred to as spillover 
accordingly  we do not recognize product sales we make into the exclusive market of johnson johnson and do recognize the product sales made by johnson johnson into our exclusive market 
sales in our exclusive market are derived from our sales to our customers  as adjusted for spillover 
we are employing an arbitrated audit methodology to measure each party s spillover based on independent third party data on shipments to end users and their estimated usage 
data on end user usage is derived in part using market sampling techniques  and accordingly  the results of such sampling can produce variability in the amount of recognized spillover 
we initially recognize spillover based on estimates of shipments to end users and their usage  utilizing historical third party data and subsequently adjust such amounts based on revised third party data as received 
differences between initial estimates of spillover and amounts based on revised third party data could produce materially different amounts for recognized epogen sales 
however  such differences to date have not been material 
deferred income taxes our effective tax rate reflects the impact of undistributed foreign earnings for which no us taxes have been provided because such earnings are intended to be invested indefinitely outside the united states based on our projected cash flow  working capital  and long term investment requirements of our us and foreign operations 
if future events  including material changes in estimates of cash  working capital  and long term investment requirements necessitate that certain assets associated with these earnings be repatriated to the united states  an additional tax provision and related liability would be required which could materially impact our future effective tax rate 
the american jobs creation act was enacted on october  one provision of the american jobs creation act effectively reduced the tax rate on a qualifying repatriation of earnings by providing for an dividend received deduction 
in the fourth quarter of  we repatriated million under the american jobs creation act  which was the maximum amount of foreign earnings qualifying for the reduced rate 
the tax expense incurred on this repatriation was approximately million 
we intend to continue to indefinitely reinvest any undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that were not repatriated under the american jobs creation act 
contingencies in the ordinary course of business  we are involved in various types of legal proceedings such as intellectual property disputes  contractual disputes  tax claims  and governmental investigations 
certain of these proceedings are discussed in item legal proceedings 
we record accruals for such contingencies to the extent we conclude their occurrence is both probable and estimable 
we consider all relevant factors when making assessments regarding these contingencies 
our income tax returns are routinely audited by the irs and various state and foreign tax authorities 
significant disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving issues of the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions because of differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations 
we periodically evaluate our exposures associated with tax filing positions 
while we believe our positions comply with applicable laws  we record liabilities based upon estimates of the ultimate outcomes of these matters 
while it is not possible to predict accurately or determine the eventual outcome of these matters  we do not believe any such items currently pending will have a material adverse effect on our annual consolidated financial statements  although an adverse resolution in any quarterly reporting period of one or more of these items could have a material impact on the results of operations for that period 
valuation of acquired intangible assets we have acquired and continue to acquire intangible assets primarily via the acquisition of biotechnology companies 
these intangible assets primarily consist of technology associated with human therapeutic products and in process product candidates as well as goodwill arising in business combinations 
when significant identifiable intangible assets are acquired  an independent third party valuation firm is engaged to assist in determining the fair values of these assets as of the acquisition date 
discounted cash flow models are typically used in these valuations  and these models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to determining the timing and expected costs to complete the in process projects  projecting regulatory approvals  estimating future cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in process projects  and developing appropriate discount rates and probability rates by project 
we believe the fair values assigned to the intangible assets acquired are based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions given available facts and circumstances as of the acquisition dates 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following tables provide information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
for our investment portfolio and debt obligations  the tables present principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
additionally  we have assumed our available for sale debt securities  comprised primarily of corporate debt instruments and treasury securities  are similar enough to aggregate for presentation purposes 
interest income earned on our fixed income investment portfolio is impacted by fluctuations in us interest rates upon reinvestment of funds received on maturity or sale of securities at the then current market rates 
changes in interest rates do not affect interest expense incurred on our notes  notes  notes  century notes and convertible notes because they bear interest at fixed rates 
however  in and  we entered into interest rate swap agreements  which qualify and are designated as fair value hedges  to protect against possible increases in value of our non convertible notes  which swapped fixed interest payments for variable interest payments over the lives of the respective notes 
for the interest rate swaps  the tables present the notional amounts and related weighted average interest rates by contractual maturity date 
variable rates relating to the interest rate swaps are the average estimated forward rates for the term of each contract 
the notional amount is used to calculate the contractual cash flows to be exchanged under the contract 
the interest rate swaps related to the available for sale debt securities shown in the table were liquidated in when the underlying available for sale fixed income securities either matured or were sold

on march   as a result of certain holders of the convertible notes exercising their march  put option  we repurchased billion  or approximately  of the outstanding convertible notes at their then accreted value for cash 
concurrently  we amended the terms of the convertible notes to add an additional put date in order to permit the remaining holders  at their option  to cause us to repurchase the remaining convertible notes on march  at the then accreted value 
however  the holders of substantially all of the convertible notes did not require us to repurchase such notes on this date 
consequently  for the december  table the amounts above reflect the convertible notes accreted value repurchased on march  and the remaining notes accreted value on march  the then next available put date and for the december  table the remaining convertible notes accreted value on march   the next available put date 
in the event the holders of the convertible notes convert their convertible notes  we generally are required to pay the accreted value in cash 
see note  financing arrangements to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the terms of the convertible notes 
we are exposed to equity price risks on the marketable portion of equity securities included in our portfolio of investments entered into for the promotion of business and strategic objectives 
these investments are generally in small capitalization stocks in the biotechnology industry sector 
at december  and  we had equity forward contracts to hedge against changes in the fair market value of a portion of our equity investment portfolio 
we did not have material equity price risk on the unhedged portion of our equity investment portfolio at december  and our results of operations are affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar as compared to foreign currencies  predominately the euro  as a result of the sales of our products in foreign markets 
foreign currency forward and option contracts are used to hedge against the effects of such fluctuations 
both positive and negative impacts to our international product sales from movements in foreign exchange rates have been mitigated by the natural  opposite impact that the investments in foreign exchange rates have on our international operating expenses and as a result of our foreign currency hedging activities 
our hedging activities seek to offset the impact  both positive and negative  that foreign exchange rate changes may have on our results of operations 
as such  the impact to our results of operations from changes in foreign currency exchange rates has been largely mitigated
