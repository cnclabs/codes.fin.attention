higher tax jurisdictions such as japan  germany and the united states contributed a higher proportion of our taxable earnings as compared to the prior year 
the unfavorable timing of the phase out phase in provisions of the united states export credit versus the manufacturing credit and the expiration of the research and development credit also adversely affected the rate for fiscal the company undergoes examination by various taxing authorities in the multiple jurisdictions in which it operates

market risk the company s market risk includes the potential loss arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
the company manages foreign currency market risk from time to time through the use of a variety of financial and derivative instruments 
the company does not enter into any of these instruments for trading purposes to generate revenue 
rather  the company s objective in managing these risks is to reduce fluctuations in earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company uses forward exchange contracts and other hedging activities to hedge the us dollar value resulting from existing recognized foreign currency denominated asset and liability balances and also for anticipated foreign currency transactions 
the company also naturally hedges foreign currency through its production in the countries in which it sells its products 
the company s market risk on interest rates is the potential decrease in fair value of long term debt resulting from a potential increase in interest rates 
see further discussion of these market risks below 
foreign currency during  the us dollar was generally stronger throughout the year relative to the currencies of the foreign countries in which the company operates 
the overall strength of the dollar had a negative impact on the company s international net sales results because the foreign denominated revenues translated into less us dollars 
it is not possible to determine the true impact of foreign currency translation changes  however  the direct effect on net sales and net earnings can be estimated 
for the year ended july   the impact of foreign currency translation resulted in an overall decrease in net sales of million and a decrease in net earnings of million 
foreign currency translation had a negative impact in several regions around the world 
in europe  the stronger us dollar relative to the euro and british pound sterling resulted in a decrease of million in net sales and a decrease of million in net earnings 
in the asia pacific region  the stronger us dollar relative to the japanese yen had a negative impact on foreign currency translation with a decrease in net sales of million and a decrease in net earnings of million 
the company maintains significant assets and operations in europe  asia pacific  south africa and mexico  resulting in exposure to foreign currency gains and losses 
a portion of the company s foreign currency exposure is naturally hedged by incurring liabilities  including bank debt  denominated in the local currency in which the company s foreign subsidiaries are located 
the foreign subsidiaries of the company purchase products and parts in various currencies 
as a result  the company may be exposed to cost increases relative to local currencies in the markets to which it sells 
to mitigate such adverse trends  the company  from time to time  enters into forward exchange contracts and other hedging activities 
additionally  foreign currency positions are partially offsetting and are netted against one another to reduce exposure 
some products made in the united states are sold abroad  primarily in europe and canada 
as a result  sales of such products are affected by the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies 
any long term strengthening of the us dollar could depress these sales 
also  competitive conditions in the company s markets may limit its ability to increase product pricing in the face of adverse currency movements 
interest the company s exposure to market risks for changes in interest rates relates primarily to its short term investments  short term borrowings and interest rate swap agreements as well as the potential increase in fair value of long term debt resulting from a potential decrease in interest rates 
the company has no earnings or cash flow exposure due to market risks on its long term debt obligations 
table of contents as a result of the fixed rate nature of the debt 
however  interest rate changes would affect the fair market value of the debt 
as of july   the estimated fair value of long term debt with fixed interest rates was million compared to its carrying value of million 
the fair value is estimated by discounting the projected cash flows using the rate that similar amounts of debt could currently be borrowed 
as of july   our financial liabilities with exposure to changes in interest rates consisted mainly of million of short term debt outstanding 
assuming a hypothetical increase of one half percent in short term interest rates  with all other variables remaining constant  interest expense would have increased million in fiscal critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented 
management bases these estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the recorded values of certain assets and liabilities 
the company believes its use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions adheres to generally accepted accounting principles and is consistently applied 
valuations based on estimates and underlying accounting assumptions are reviewed for reasonableness on a consistent basis throughout the company 
management believes the company s critical accounting policies that require more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements and that are the most important to aid in fully understanding its financial results are the following revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts revenue is recognized when product ownership and the risk of loss has transferred to the customer and the company has no remaining obligations 
the company records estimated discounts and rebates as a reduction of sales in the same period revenue is recognized 
allowances for doubtful accounts are estimated by management based on evaluation of potential losses related to customer receivable balances 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is the company s best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in its existing accounts receivable 
the company determines the allowance based on historical write off experience in the industry  regional economic data and evaluation of specific customer accounts for risk of loss 
the company reviews its allowance for doubtful accounts monthly 
past due balances over days and over a specified amount are reviewed individually for collectibility 
all other balances are reviewed on a pooled basis by type of receivable 
account balances are charged off against the allowance when the company feels it is probable the receivable will not be recovered 
the company does not have any off balance sheet credit exposure related to its customers 
the establishment of this reserve requires the use of judgment and assumptions regarding the potential for losses on receivable balances 
though management considers these balances adequate and proper  changes in economic conditions in specific markets in which the company operates could have an effect on reserve balances required 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill is tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the company performs impairment reviews for its reporting units and uses a discounted cash flow model based on management s judgments and assumptions to determine the estimated fair value 
an impairment loss generally would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
the company performed an impairment test during the third quarter of fiscal to satisfy its annual impairment requirement 
impairment testing in the third quarter indicated that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its corresponding carrying amount  including recorded goodwill and  as such  no impairment existed at that time 
other intangible assets with definite lives continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
definite lived intangible assets are also subject to impairment testing 
a considerable amount of management judgment and assumptions are required in performing the impairment tests  principally in determining the fair value of each reporting unit 
while the company believes its judgments and assumptions are reasonable  different assumptions could change the estimated fair values and  therefore  impairment charges could be required 

table of contents inventory the company s inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
domestic inventories are valued using the last in first out lifo method  while the international subsidiaries use the first in  first out fifo method 
reserves for shrink and obsolescence are estimated using standard quantitative measures based on historical losses  including issues related to specific inventory items 
though management considers these balances adequate and proper  changes in economic conditions in specific markets in which the company operates could have an effect on reserve balances required 
product warranty the company estimates warranty costs using standard quantitative measures based on historical warranty claim experience and  in some cases  evaluating specific customer warranty issues 
the establishment of reserves requires the use of judgment and assumptions regarding the potential for losses relating to warranty issues 
though management considers these balances adequate and proper  changes in the future could impact these determinations 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing the company s consolidated financial statements  management is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which the company operates 
this process involves estimating actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and book accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the company s consolidated balance sheet 
these assets and liabilities are evaluated by using estimates of future taxable income streams and the impact of tax planning strategies 
management assesses the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent management believes that recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance is established 
to the extent that a valuation allowance is established or increased  an expense within the tax provision is included in the statement of operations 
reserves are also estimated for uncertain tax positions that are currently unresolved 
the company routinely monitors the potential impact of such situations and believes that it is properly reserved 
valuations related to tax accruals and assets can be impacted by changes to tax codes  changes in statutory tax rates and the company s future taxable income levels 
employee benefit plans the company incurs expenses relating to employee benefits such as non contributory defined benefit pension plans and postretirement health care benefits 
in accounting for these employment costs  management must make a variety of assumptions and estimates including mortality rates  discount rates  overall company compensation increases  expected return on plan assets and health care cost trend rates 
the company considers historical data as well as current facts and circumstances and uses a third party specialist to assist management in determining these estimates 
to develop the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption for its pension plans  the company considered the historical returns and the future expectations for returns for each asset class  as well as the target asset allocation of the pension portfolio 
reflecting the relatively long term nature of the plans obligations  approximately percent of the plans assets were invested in equities and percent of plans assets in alternative investments with the balance primarily invested in fixed income instruments 
a one percent change in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would change the annual pension expense by approximately million 
the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption for the plans outside the us follows the same methodology as described above but reflects the investment allocation and expected total portfolio returns specific to each plan and country 
the company s objective in selecting a discount rate for its pension plans is to select the best estimate of the rate at which the benefit obligations could be effectively settled on the measurement date taking into account the nature and duration of the benefit obligations of the plan 
in making this best estimate  the company looks at rates of return on high quality fixed income investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the benefits 
this process includes looking at the universe of bonds available on the measurement date with a quality rating of aa or better 
similar appropriate benchmarks are used to determine the discount rate for the non us plans 
as of our measurement date of april   the company increased its discount rate on us plans to percent from percent as of april  the increase of basis points was consistent with the changes in published bond indices 
the change decreased the company s us projected benefit obligation as of april  by approximately million and is expected to decrease pension expense in fiscal year by approximately million 

table of contents at april   the company s annual measurement date for its pension plans  the plans were over funded by million since the fair value of plan assets exceeded the projected benefit obligation 
as of april   the company has an unrecognized actuarial loss of million which will be recognized as pension expense into the future over the average remaining service period of the employees in the plans in accordance with sfas forward looking statements the company  through its management  may make forward looking statements reflecting the company s current views with respect to future events and financial performance
