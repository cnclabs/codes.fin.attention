item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations all dollar figures expressed herein are expressed in thousands  except share and per share amounts 
general anthracite capital  inc the company  a maryland corporation  is a real estate finance company that invests in high yielding commercial real estate debt 
the company commenced operations on march  the company s common stock is traded on the new york stock exchange under the symbol ahr 
the company s primary long term objective is to distribute dividends supported by earnings 
the company establishes its dividend by analyzing the long term sustainability of earnings given existing market conditions and the current composition of its portfolio 
this includes an analysis of the company s credit loss assumptions  general level of interest rates and projected hedging costs 
the company s principal focus is to invest in a diverse portfolio of primarily high yield commercial real estate loans and commercial mortgage backed securities cmbs 
the cmbs that the company purchases are fixed income instruments similar to bonds that carry an interest coupon and stated principal 
the cash flow used to pay the interest and principal on the cmbs comes from a designated pool of first mortgage loans on commercial real estate the underlying loans 
underlying loans usually are originated by commercial banks or investment banks and are secured by a first mortgage on office buildings  retail centers  apartment buildings  hotels and other types of commercial real estate 
a typical loan pool may contain several hundred loans with principal amounts of as little as  to over  the pooling concept permits significant geographic diversification 
converting loans into cmbs in this fashion allows investors to purchase these securities in global capital markets and to participate in the commercial real estate sector with significant diversification among property types  sizes and locations in one fixed income investment 
the type of cmbs issued from a typical loan pool is generally broken down by credit rating 
the highest rated cmbs will receive payments of principal first and is therefore least exposed to the credit performance of the underlying loan 
these securities will carry a credit rating of aaa and will be issued with a principal amount that represents some portion of the total principal amount of the underlying loan pool 
the cmbs that receive principal payments last are generally rated below investment grade bb or lower 
as the last to receive principal these cmbs are also the first to absorb any credit losses incurred in the underlying loan pool 
the principal amount of these below investment grade classes generally represents of the principal of the underlying loan pools 
the investor that owns the lowest rated  or non rated  cmbs class is designated as the controlling class representative for the underlying loan pool 
this designation allows the holder to assert a significant degree of influence over any workouts or foreclosures of defaulted underlying loans 
these securities are generally issued with a high yield to compensate for the credit risk inherent in owning the cmbs class which is the first to absorb losses 
the company s high yield commercial real estate loan strategy encompasses b notes defined below and mezzanine loans 
b notes and mezzanine loans are based on a similar concept of investing in a portion of the principal and interest of a specific loan instead of a pool of loans as in cmbs 
in the case of b notes the principal amount of a single loan is separated into a senior interest a note and a junior interest b note 
prior to a borrower default  the a note and the b note receive principal and interest pari passu  however after a borrower default  the a note would receive its principal and interest first and the b note would absorb the credit losses that occur  if any  up to the full amount of its principal 
the b note holder generally has certain rights to influence workouts or foreclosures 
the company invests in b notes as they provide relatively high yields with a degree of influence over dispositions 
mezzanine loans are secured by ownership interests in an entity that owns real estate 
these loans are generally subordinated to a first mortgage and would absorb a credit loss prior to the senior mortgage holder 
the company is managed by blackrock financial management  inc the manager  a subsidiary of blackrock  inc  a publicly traded nyse blk asset management company with approximately billion of assets under management at december  the company believes that the trend toward highly structured investment products requires significant expertise in traditional real estate underwriting as well as in the capital markets

the purchase of the aforementioned securities was offset by the sale of assets with an estimated fair value of  in cdo hy see securitizations below 
the company s cdo offerings allow the company to match fund its commercial real estate portfolio by issuing long term debt to finance long term assets 
the cdo debt is non recourse to the company  therefore  the company s losses are limited to its equity investment in the cdo 
the cdo debt is also hedged to protect the company from an increase in short term interest rates

the company considers the cmbs securities where it maintains the right to influence the foreclosure workout process on the underlying loans its controlling class cmbs controlling class 
the distinction between the two is in the rights the company obtains with its investment in controlling class cmbs 
controlling class rights allow the company to influence the workout and or disposition of defaults that occur in the underlying loans 
these securities absorb the first losses realized in the underlying loan pools 
the coupon payment on the non rated security also can be reduced for special servicer fees charged to the trust 
the next highest rated security in the structure then generally will be downgraded to non rated and become the first to absorb losses and expenses from that point on 
at december   the company owns different trusts where it is in the first loss position and is designated as the controlling class representative by owning the lowest rated or non rated cmbs class 
the total par of the loans underlying these securities was  at december   subordinated controlling class cmbs with a par of  were included on the company s consolidated statement of financial condition and subordinated controlling class cmbs with a par of  were held as collateral for cdos hy and hy the company s other below investment grade cmbs have more limited rights associated with its ownership to influence the workout and or disposition of underlying loan defaults 
the total par of the company s other below investment grade cmbs at december  was  the average credit protection  or subordination level  of this portfolio is 
the company s investment in its subordinated controlling class cmbs securities by credit rating category at december  is as follows weighted adjusted average estimated dollar purchase dollar subordination par fair value price price price level bb    bb    bb    b    b    b    nr    n a total    the company s investment in its subordinated controlling class cmbs securities by credit rating category at december  is as follows weighted adjusted average estimated dollar purchase dollar subordination par fair value price price price level bb    bb    bb    b    b    b    ccc    nr    n a total    during  the par amount of the company s controlling class cmbs was reduced by  of this amount   of the par reductions were related to controlling class cmbs held in cdo hy and cdo hy further delinquencies and losses may cause the par reductions to continue and cause the company to conclude that a change in loss adjusted yield is required along with a write down of the adjusted purchase price through the income statement according to emerging issue task force eitf also during  the loan pools were paid down by  pay down proceeds are distributed to the highest rated cmbs class first and reduce the percent of total underlying collateral represented by each rating category 
for all of the company s controlling class securities  the company follows a policy of assigning estimated losses to specific loans as well as adding a general loss assumption that is not loan specific 
overall the company assumes that a total of of the original loan balance will not be recoverable on specific loans 
the general loss assumption varies by transactions but is in a range of ten to forty basis points per year of defaults with a loss severity which takes one year to recover 
these estimates were developed based on an analysis of individual loan characteristics and prevailing market conditions at the time of origination 
all estimated workout expenses including special servicer fees are included in these assumptions 
actual results could differ materially from these estimated results 
see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for a discussion of how differences between estimated and actual losses could affect company earnings 
the company considers delinquency information from the lehman brothers conduit guide to be the most relevant benchmark to measure credit performance and market conditions applicable to its controlling class cmbs holdings 
the year of issuance  or vintage year  is important  as older loan pools will tend to have more delinquencies than newly underwritten loans 
the company owns controlling class cmbs issued in       and comparable delinquency statistics referenced by vintage year as a percentage of par outstanding at december  are shown in the table below underlying delinquencies lehman brothers conduit vintage year collateral outstanding guide total  weighted average based on current principal balance 
delinquencies on the company s cmbs collateral as a percent of principal are in line with expectations and are consistent with comparable data provided in the lehman brothers conduit guide 
morgan stanley also tracks cmbs loan delinquencies for the specific cmbs transactions with more than  of collateral and that have been seasoned for at least one year 
these seasoning criteria generally will adjust for the lower delinquencies that occur in newly originated collateral 
at december   the morgan stanley index indicated that delinquencies on securitizations were  and at december   this same index indicated that delinquencies on securitizations were 
see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks for a detailed discussion of how delinquencies and loan losses affect the company 
the following table sets forth certain information relating to the aggregate principal balance and payment status of delinquent mortgage loans underlying the controlling class cmbs held by the company at december  and number of of number of of principal loans collateral principal loans collateral past due days to days   past due days to days   past due days or more   real estate owned   foreclosure  total delinquent   total collateral balance     of the delinquent loans at december   four loans were real estate owned and being marketed for sale  one loan was in foreclosure and the remaining loans were in some form of workout negotiations 
the controlling class cmbs owned by the company have a delinquency rate of  which is consistent with industry averages 
during  the underlying collateral experienced early payoffs of  representing of the year end pool balance 
these loans were paid off at par with no loss 
aggregate losses related to the underlying collateral of  were realized during year ended december  this brings cumulative realized losses to  which is of total estimated losses 
these losses include special servicer and other workout expenses 
this experience to date is in line with the company s loss expectations 
realized losses and special servicer expenses are expected to increase on the underlying loans as the portfolio matures 
special servicer expenses are also expected to increase as portfolios mature 
to the extent that realized losses differ from the company s original loss estimates  it may be necessary to reduce or increase the projected yield on the applicable cmbs investment to better reflect such investment s expected earnings net of expected losses  from the date of purchase 
while realized losses on individual assets may be higher or lower than original estimates  the company currently believes its aggregate loss estimates and yields remain appropriate 
the company manages its credit risk through disciplined underwriting  diversification  active monitoring of loan performance and exercise of its right to influence the workout process for delinquent loans as early as possible 
the company maintains diversification of credit exposures through its underwriting process and can shift its focus in future investments by adjusting the mix of loans in subsequent acquisitions 
the comparative profiles of the loans underlying the company s cmbs by property type at december  and for the two prior years are as follows exposure exposure exposure loan of of of property type balance total loan balance total loan balance total multifamily    retail    office    lodging    industrial    healthcare    other    total    at december  and  the mortgage loans underlying the controlling class cmbs held by the company were secured by properties at the locations identified below percentage geographic location california texas new york florida other total based on a percentage of the total unpaid principal balance of the underlying loans 
no other individual category comprises more than of the total 
at december   the estimated fair value of the company s holdings of controlling class cmbs is  higher than the adjusted cost for these securities which consists of gross unrealized gains of  and gross unrealized losses of  the adjusted purchase price of the company s controlling class cmbs portfolio at december  represents approximately of its par amount 
the estimated fair value of the company s controlling class cmbs portfolio at december  represents approximately of its par amount 
as the portfolio matures  the company expects to recoup the  of unrealized loss  provided that the credit losses experienced are not greater than the credit losses assumed in the projected cash flow analysis 
at december   the company believes there has been no material deterioration in the credit quality of its portfolio below current expectations 
as the portfolio matures and expected losses occur  subordination levels of the lower rated classes of a cmbs investment will be reduced 
this may cause the lower rated classes to be downgraded  which would negatively affect their estimated fair value and therefore the company s net asset value 
reduced estimated fair value will negatively affect the company s ability to finance any such securities that are not financed through a cdo or similar matched funding vehicle 
in some cases  securities held by the company may be upgraded to reflect seasoning of the underlying collateral and thus would increase the estimated fair value of the securities 
during the company experienced ten rating upgrades on four of the company s controlling class cmbs and no downgrades 
additionally  the company experienced upgrades and four downgrades related to non controlling class commercial real estate securities during the company s income calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap for its cmbs securities is computed based upon a yield  which assumes credit losses would occur 
the yield to compute the company s taxable income does not assume there would be credit losses  as a loss can only be deducted for tax purposes when it has occurred 
as a result  for the years through december   the company s gaap income accrued on its cmbs assets was approximately  lower than the taxable income accrued on the cmbs assets 
affect of hurricanes on below investment grade cmbs during the third quarter of  four properties which are security for mortgages in four separate controlling class cmbs transactions were severely damaged by hurricane katrina 
the outstanding loan balances on these four properties is  based on the company s on site review of the damage incurred and information available to date  the company believes that three properties have adequate insurance coverage and the cash flows related to those controlling class cmbs transactions should not be adversely affected 
as a result  the company has not adjusted the carrying value or the loss adjusted yields for the controlling class cmbs transactions that include those three properties 
the fourth property suffered significant damage  and the anticipated loss for this property has been adjusted 
as more information about reconstruction costs is received  losses may be adjusted further 
in addition  the company has concluded that no properties in its controlling class cmbs transactions were substantially affected by hurricane wilma 
commercial real estate loan activity the company s commercial real estate loan portfolio generally emphasizes larger transactions located in metropolitan markets  as compared to the typical loan in the cmbs portfolio

critical accounting estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on the amounts reported in the company s consolidated financial statements 
these financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap 
in preparing the financial statements  management is required to make various judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
the following is a summary of the company s accounting policies that are the most affected by management judgments  estimates and assumptions securities available for sale the company has designated certain investments in mortgage backed securities  mortgage related securities and certain other securities as available for sale 
securities available for sale are carried at estimated fair value with the net unrealized gains or losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity 
many of these investments are relatively illiquid  and management must estimate their values 
in making these estimates  management generally utilizes market prices provided by dealers who make markets in these securities  but may  under certain circumstances  adjust these valuations based on management s judgment 
changes in the valuations do not affect the company s reported net income or cash flows  but impact stockholders equity and  accordingly  book value per share 
management must also assess whether unrealized losses on securities reflect a decline in value that is other than temporary  and  accordingly  write the impaired security down to its fair value  through earnings 
significant judgment by management is required in this analysis  which includes  but is not limited to  making assumptions regarding the collectability of the principal and interest  net of related expenses  on the underlying loans 
income on these securities is recognized based upon a number of assumptions that are subject to uncertainties and contingencies 
examples include  among other things  the rate and timing of principal payments including prepayments  repurchases  defaults and liquidations  the pass through or coupon rate and interest rate fluctuations 
additional factors that may affect the company s reported interest income on its mortgage securities include interest payment shortfalls due to delinquencies on the underlying mortgage loans  the timing and magnitude of credit losses on the mortgage loans underlying the securities that are a result of the general condition of the real estate market including competition for tenants and their related credit quality and changes in market rental rates 
these uncertainties and contingencies are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may alter the assumptions 
the company recognizes interest income from its purchased beneficial interests in securitized financial interests beneficial interests other than beneficial interests of high credit quality  sufficiently collateralized to ensure that the possibility of credit loss is remote  or that cannot contractually be prepaid or otherwise settled in such a way that the company would not recover substantially all of its recorded investment in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue  recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased and retained beneficial interests in securitized financial assets eitf 
accordingly  on a quarterly basis  when changes in estimated cash flows from the cash flows previously estimated occur due to actual prepayment and credit loss experience  the company calculates a revised yield based on the current amortized cost of the investment including any other than temporary impairments recognized to date and the revised cash flows 
the revised yield is then applied prospectively to recognize interest income 
for other mortgage backed and related mortgage securities  the company accounts for interest income under sfas no 
 accounting for nonrefundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans and initial direct costs of leases sfas no 
 using the effective yield method which includes the amortization of discount or premium arising at the time of purchase and the stated or coupon interest payments 
impairment securities in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas no 
 when the estimated fair value of the security classified as available for sale has been below amortized cost for a significant period of time and the company concludes that it no longer has the ability or intent to hold the security for the period of time over which the company expects the values to recover to amortized cost  the investment is written down to its fair value 
the resulting charge is included in income  and a new cost basis is established 
additionally  under eitf  when changes in estimated cash flows from the cash flows previously estimated occur due to actual prepayment and credit loss experience  and the present value of the revised cash flows using the current expected yield is less than the present value of the previously estimated remaining cash flows adjusted for cash receipts during the intervening period  an other than temporary impairment is deemed to have occurred 
accordingly  the security is written down to fair value with the resulting change being included in income  and a new cost basis established 
in both instances  the original discount or premium is written off when the new cost basis is established 
after taking into account the effect of an impairment charge  income is recognized under eitf or sfas no 
 as applicable  using the market yield for the security used in establishing the write down 
variable interest entities the consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the company and its subsidiaries  which are wholly owned or controlled by the company or entities which are variable interest entities vies in which the company is the primary beneficiary under fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities revised december fin r 
fin r requires a vie to be consolidated by its primary beneficiary 
the primary beneficiary is the party that absorbs the majority of the vie s expected losses and or the majority of the expected returns 
the company has evaluated its investments for potential variable interests by evaluating the sufficiency of the entity s equity investment at risk to absorb losses 
all significant inter company balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
the company has analyzed the governing pooling and servicing agreements for each of its controlling class cmbs and believes that the terms are industry standard and are consistent with the qualifying special purpose entity qspe criteria 
however  there is uncertainty with respect to qspe treatment due to ongoing review by accounting standard setters  potential actions by various parties involved with the qspe  as well as varying and evolving interpretations of the qspe criteria under sfas no 
additionally  the standard setters continue to review the fin r provisions related to the computations used to determine the primary beneficiary of a vie 
future guidance from the standard setters may require the company to consolidate cmbs trusts in which the company has invested 
mortgage loans the company purchases and originates commercial mortgage loans to be held as long term investments 
the company also has investments in private opportunity funds that invest in commercial mortgage loans that are managed by the manager 
management periodically must evaluate each loan for possible impairment 
impairment is indicated when it is deemed probable that the company will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan 
if a loan were determined to be impaired  the company would establish a reserve for probable losses and a corresponding charge to earnings 
given the nature of the company s loan portfolio and the underlying commercial real estate collateral  significant judgment of management is required in determining impairment and the resulting loan loss allowance  which includes but is not limited to making assumptions regarding the value of the real estate that secures the mortgage loan 
to date  the company has determined that no loan loss allowances have been necessary on the loans in its portfolio or held by the opportunity funds 
derivative instruments the company utilizes various hedging instruments derivatives to hedge interest rate and foreign currency exposures or to modify the interest rate or foreign currency characteristics of related company investments 
all derivatives are carried at fair value  generally estimated by management based on valuations provided by the counterparty to the derivative contract 
for accounting purposes  the company s management must decide whether to designate these derivatives as either a hedge of an asset or liability  securities available for sale  securities held for trading  or foreign currency exposure 
this designation decision affects the manner in which the changes in the fair value of the derivatives are reported

 accounting for stock issued to employees 
this statement establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services  primarily focusing on the accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
entities will be required to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award with limited exceptions 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service usually the vesting period in exchange for the award 
the grant date fair value of employee share options and similar instruments will be estimated using option pricing models 
if an equity award is modified after the grant date  incremental compensation cost will be recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the fair value of the modified award over the fair value of the original award immediately before the modification 
as amended by rule a of regulation s x promulgated by the sec  this statement is effective as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period of the company s first fiscal year beginning on or after december  the company will adopt sfas no

based on the clarification provided in fsp fas and fas  the amount of any other than temporary impairment that needs to be recognized will continue to be dependent on market conditions  the occurrence of certain events or changes in circumstances relative to an investee and an entity s intent and ability to hold the impaired investment at the time of the valuation 
fsp fas and fas is effective for reporting periods beginning after december  adoption of this fsp does not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
reverse repurchase agreements the company understands that the fasb is considering placing an item on its agenda relating to the treatment of transactions where mortgage backed securities purchased from a particular counterparty are financed via a repurchase agreement with the same counterparty 
currently  the company records such assets and the related financing gross on the consolidated statement of financial condition  and the corresponding interest income and interest expense gross on the consolidated statement of operations 
any change in fair value of the security is reported through other comprehensive income under sfas no 
 because the security is classified as available for sale 
however  in a transaction where the mortgage backed securities are acquired from and financed under a repurchase agreement with the same counterparty  the acquisition may not qualify as a sale from the seller s perspective under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
in such cases  the seller may be required to continue to consolidate the assets sold to the company  based on their continuing involvement with such investments 
depending on the ultimate outcome of the fasb deliberations  the company may be precluded from presenting the assets gross on our balance sheet and should instead be treating our net investment in such assets as a derivative 
if it is determined that these transactions should be treated as investments in derivatives  the derivative instruments entered into by the company to hedge the company s interest rate exposure with respect to the borrowings under the associated repurchase agreements may no longer qualify for hedge accounting  and would then  as with the underlying asset transactions  also be marked to market through the income statement 
this potential change in accounting treatment does not affect the economics of the transactions but does affect how the transactions would be reported in the consolidated financial statements 
the company s cash flows  liquidity and ability to pay a dividend would be unchanged  and we do not believe our reit taxable income or reit status would be affected 
the company s net equity would not be materially affected 
at december   the company has identified available for sale securities with a fair value of  which had been purchased from and financed with the same counterparty since their purchase 
if the company were to change the current accounting treatment for these transactions at december   total assets and total liabilities would each be reduced by approximately  interest income the following tables set forth information regarding income from certain of the company s interest earning assets

the company continually monitors the rating and overall credit quality of its swap counterparties 
capital resources and liquidity the company requires capital to fund its investment activities and operating expenses 
the company has sufficient access to capital resources to fund its existing business plan 
the company s capital sources include cash flow from operations  borrowings under reverse repurchase agreements  lines of credit  cdos  and the issuance of preferred and common equity securities 
the distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code limit the company s ability to retain earnings and thereby replenish or increase capital committed to its operations 
however  the company believes that its access to significant capital resources and financing will enable the company to meet current and anticipated capital requirements 
the company believes that its existing sources of funds will be adequate for purposes of meeting its short and long term liquidity needs 
the company s ability to meet its long term ie  beyond one year liquidity requirements is subject to obtaining additional debt and equity financing 
any decision by the company s lenders and investors to provide the company with financing will depend upon a number of factors  such as the company s compliance with the terms of its existing credit arrangements  the company s financial performance  industry or market trends  the general availability of and rates applicable to financing transactions  such lenders and investors resources and policies concerning the terms under which they make capital commitments and the relative attractiveness of alternative investment or lending opportunities 
reverse repurchase agreements and lines of credit reverse repurchase agreements are secured loans generally with a term of days 
the interest rate is based on day libor plus a spread that is determined based on the asset pledged as security 
the terms include a daily mark to market provision that requires the posting of additional collateral if the value of the pledged asset declines 
after the day period expires  there is no obligation for the lender to extend credit for an additional period 
this type of financing generally is available only for more liquid securities 
the interest rate charged on reverse repurchase agreements is usually the lowest relative to the alternatives due to the lower risk inherent in these transactions 
committed financing facilities represent multi year agreements to provide secured financing for a specific asset class 
these facilities include a mark to market provision requiring the company to repay borrowings if the value of the pledged asset declines in excess of the threshold amount 
a significant difference between committed financing facilities and reverse repurchase agreements is the term of the financing 
a committed facility provider generally is required to provide financing for the full term of the agreement  usually two to three years  rather than thirty days as generally used in the reverse repurchase market 
this longer term makes the financing of less liquid assets viable 
cdos issuance of secured term debt is generally done through a cdo offering 
this entails creating a special purpose entity that holds assets used to secure the payments required of the debt issued 
asset cash flows generally are matched with the debt service requirements over their respective lives and an interest rate swap is used to match the fixed or floating rate nature of the coupon payments where necessary 
this type of transaction is usually referred to as match funding or term financing the assets 
there is no mark to market requirement in this structure and the debt cannot be called or terminated by the bondholders 
furthermore  the debt issued is non recourse to the issuer  and therefore permanent reductions in value do not affect the liquidity of the company 
however  since the company expects to earn a positive spread between the income generated by the assets and the expense of the debt issued  a permanent impairment of any of the assets would negatively affect the spread over time

preferred stock generally has a fixed coupon and may have a fixed term in the form of a maturity date or other redemption or conversion features 
the preferred stockholder typically has the right to a preferential distribution for dividends and any liquidity proceeds 
another source of permanent capital is the issuance of common stock through a follow on offering 
this allows investors to purchase a large block of common stock in one transaction 
a common stock issuance can be accretive to the company s book value per share if the issue price per share exceeds the company s book value per share 
it also can be accretive to earnings per share if the company deploys the new capital into assets that generate a risk adjusted return that exceeds the return of the company s existing assets 
furthermore  earnings accretion also can be achieved at reinvestment rates that are lower than the return on existing assets if common stock is issued at a premium to book value 
the company continuously evaluates the market for follow on common stock offerings as well as the available opportunities to deploy new capital on an accretive basis

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk includes the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates  credit curve spreads  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
the primary market risks to which the company is exposed are interest rate risk and credit curve risk 
interest rate risk is highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental  monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond the control of the company 
credit curve risk is highly sensitive to the dynamics of the markets for commercial mortgage securities and other loans and securities held by the company 
excessive supply of these assets combined with reduced demand will cause the market to require a higher yield 
this demand for higher yield will cause the market to use a higher spread over the us treasury securities yield curve  or other benchmark interest rates  to value these assets 
changes in the general level of the us treasury yield curve can have significant effects on the estimated fair value of the company s portfolio 
the majority of the company s assets are fixed rate securities valued based on a market credit spread to us treasuries 
as us treasury securities are priced to a higher yield and or the spread to us treasuries used to price the company s assets is increased  the estimated fair value of the company s portfolio may decline 
conversely  as us treasury securities are priced to a lower yield and or the spread to us treasuries used to price the company s assets is decreased  the estimated fair value of the company s portfolio may increase 
changes in the estimated fair value of the company s portfolio may affect the company s net income or cash flow directly through their impact on unrealized gains or losses on securities held for trading or indirectly through their impact on the company s ability to borrow 
changes in the level of the us treasury yield curve can also affect  among other things  the prepayment assumptions used to value certain of the company s securities and the company s ability to realize gains from the sale of such assets 
in addition  changes in the general level of the libor money market rates can affect the company s net interest income 
at december   all of the company s liabilities outside of the cdos are floating rate based on a market spread to libor 
as the level of libor increases or decreases  the company s interest expense will move in the same direction 
the company may utilize a variety of financial instruments  including interest rate swaps  caps  floors and other interest rate exchange contracts  in order to limit the effects of fluctuations in interest rates on its operations 
the use of these types of derivatives to hedge interest earning assets and or interest bearing liabilities carries certain risks  including the risk that losses on a hedge position will reduce the funds available for payments to holders of securities and that such losses may exceed the amount invested in such instruments 
a hedge may not perform its intended purpose of offsetting losses or rising interest rates 
moreover  with respect to certain of the instruments used as hedges  the company is exposed to the risk that the counterparties with which the company trades may cease making markets and quoting prices in such instruments  which may render the company unable to enter into an offsetting transaction with respect to an open position 
if the company anticipates that the income from any such hedging transaction will not be qualifying income for reit income purposes  the company may conduct part or all of its hedging activities through a to be formed corporate subsidiary that is fully subject to federal corporate income taxation 
the profitability of the company may be adversely affected during any period as a result of changing interest rates 
the company monitors and manages interest rate risk based on a method that takes into consideration the interest rate sensitivity of the company s assets and liabilities  including its preferred stock 
the company s objective is to acquire assets and match fund the purchase so that interest rate risk associated with financing these assets is reduced or eliminated 
the primary risks associated with acquiring and financing these assets under day repurchase agreements and committed borrowing facilities are mark to market risk and short term rate risk 
certain secured financing arrangements provide for an advance rate based upon a percentage of the estimated fair value of the asset being financed 
market movements that cause asset values to decline would require a margin call or a cash payment to maintain the relationship between asset value and amount borrowed 
a cash flow based cdo is an example of a secured financing vehicle that does not require a mark to market to establish or maintain a level of financing 
when financed assets are subject to a mark to market margin call  the company carefully monitors the interest rate sensitivity of those assets 
the duration of the assets financed which are subject to a mark to market margin call was years based on net asset value at december  this means that a basis point increase in interest rates would cause a margin call of approximately  earnings per share is analyzed using the assumptions that interest rates  as defined by the libor curve  increase or decrease and that the yield curves of the libor rate shocks will be parallel to each other 
estimated fair value in this scenario is calculated using the assumption that the us treasury yield curve remains constant even though changes in both long and short term interest rates can occur simultaneously 
regarding the table below  all changes in income and value are measured as percentage changes from the respective values calculated in the scenario labeled as base case 
the base interest rate scenario assumes interest rates at december  actual results could differ significantly from these estimates 
projected percentage change in earnings per share given libor movements change in libor  projected change in basis points earnings per share base case the company s gaap book value incorporates the estimated fair value of the company s interest bearing assets but it does not incorporate the estimated fair value of the company s interest bearing fixed rate liabilities and preferred stock 
the fixed rate liabilities and preferred stock generally will reduce the actual interest rate risk of the company from a pure economic perspective even though changes in the estimated fair value of these liabilities are not reflected in the company s reported book value 
the company focuses on economic risk in managing its sensitivity to interest rates and maintains an economic duration within a band of to years 
at december   economic duration for the company s entire portfolio was years 
this implies that for each basis points of change in interest rates the company s economic value will change by approximately 
at december  the company estimates its economic value  or net asset value of its common stock to be  a reconciliation of the economic duration of the company to the duration of the reported book value of the company s common stock is as follows duration gaap book value at december  less duration contribution of cdo i liabilities duration contribution of cdo ii liabilities duration contribution of cdo iii liabilities duration contribution of series c preferred stock duration contribution of junior subordinated notes economic duration at december  the gaap book value of the company s common stock is per share 
as indicated in the table above a basis point change in interest rates will change reported book value by approximately  or  as indicated above  approximately  of that change would be required to meet margin calls in the event rates rise by basis points 
credit risk the company s portfolios of commercial real estate assets are subject to a high degree of credit risk 
credit risk is the exposure to loss from loan defaults 
default rates are subject to a wide variety of factors  including  but not limited to  property performance  property management  supply demand factors  construction trends  consumer behavior  regional economics  interest rates  the strength of the us economy  and other factors beyond the control of the company 
all loans are subject to a certain probability of default 
before acquiring a controlling class security  the company will perform an analysis of the quality of all of the loans proposed 
as a result of this analysis  loans with unacceptable risk profiles are either removed from the proposed pool or the company receives a price adjustment 
the company underwrites its controlling class cmbs investments assuming the underlying loans will suffer a certain dollar amount of defaults and these defaults will lead to some level of realized losses 
loss adjusted yields are computed based on these assumptions and applied to each class of security supported by the cash flow on the underlying loans 
the most significant variables affecting loss adjusted yields include  but are not limited to  the number of defaults  the severity of loss that occurs subsequent to a default and the timing of the actual loss 
the different rating levels of cmbs will react differently to changes in these assumptions 
the lowest rated securities b or lower are generally more sensitive to changes in timing of actual losses 
the higher rated securities b or higher are more sensitive to the severity of losses and timing of cashflows 
the company generally assumes that all of the principal of a non rated security and a significant portion  if not all  of ccc and a portion of b rated securities will not be recoverable over time 
the loss adjusted yields of these classes reflect that assumption  therefore  the timing of when the total loss of principal occurs is the most important assumption in determining value 
the interest coupon generated by a security will cease when there is a total loss of its principal regardless of whether that principal is paid 
therefore  timing is of paramount importance because the longer the principal balance remains outstanding  the more interest coupon the holder receives  which results in a larger economic return 
alternatively  if principal is lost faster than originally assumed  there is less opportunity to receive interest coupon  which results in a lower or possibly negative return 
if actual principal losses on the underlying loans exceed assumptions  the higher rated securities will be affected more significantly as a loss of principal may not have been assumed 
the company generally assumes that all principal will be recovered by classes rated b or higher 
the company manages credit risk through the underwriting process  establishing loss assumptions and careful monitoring of loan performance 
after the securities have been acquired  the company monitors the performance of the loans  as well as external factors that may affect their value 
factors that indicate a higher loss severity or acceleration of the timing of an expected loss will cause a reduction in the expected yield and therefore reduce the earnings of the company 
furthermore  the company may be required to write down a portion of the adjusted purchase price of the affected assets through its consolidated statements of operations 
for purposes of illustration  a doubling of the losses in the company s controlling class cmbs  without a significant acceleration of those losses  would reduce gaap income going forward by approximately per share of common stock per year and cause a significant write down at the time the loss assumption is changed 
the amount of the write down depends on several factors  including which securities are most affected at the time of the write down  but is estimated to be in the range of to per share based on a doubling of expected losses 
a significant acceleration of the timing of these losses would cause the company s net income to decrease 
the company s exposure to a write down is mitigated by the fact that most of these assets are financed on a non recourse basis in the company s cdos  where a significant portion of the risk of loss is transferred to the cdo bondholders 
at december   securities with a total estimated fair value of  are collateralizing the cdo borrowings of  therefore  the company s preferred equity interest in the three cdos is  per share 
the cdo borrowings are not marked to market in accordance with gaap even though their economic value will change in response to changes in interest rates and or credit spreads 
asset and liability management asset and liability management is concerned with the timing and magnitude of the re pricing and or maturing of assets and liabilities 
it is the company s objective to attempt to control risks associated with interest rate movements 
in general  management s strategy is to match the term of the company s liabilities as closely as possible with the expected holding period of the company s assets 
this is less important for those assets in the company s portfolio considered liquid  as there is a very stable market for the financing of these securities 
other methods for evaluating interest rate risk  such as interest rate sensitivity gap defined as the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities maturing or re pricing within a given time period  are used but are considered of lesser significance in the daily management of the company s portfolio 
management considers this relationship when reviewing the company s hedging strategies 
because different types of assets and liabilities with the same or similar maturities react differently to changes in overall market rates or conditions  changes in interest rates may affect the company s net interest income positively or negatively even if the company were to be perfectly matched in each maturity category
