these revenues were in addition to the fixed fees recorded in financial product fees earned from the facilitation of rals 
the finance fee was calculated as a percentage of the total loan amount subject to a minimum and maximum fee 
the finance fees were maintained by the financial institutions as a reserve against uncollected loans

as indicated in the table below  older offices grow at relatively lower rates than younger offices 
the average number of tax returns prepared by one year old offices is lower than in prior years primarily due to fewer new tax returns prepared by independent tax businesses acquired converted in fiscal for example  in fiscal we acquired converted offices preparing approximately  tax returns annually as compared to acquiring converting an annual average of approximately  tax returns over the prior four years  and for which such offices typically prepare between and  tax returns 
in addition to the impact caused by acquisitions conversions  a higher proportion of retail partner locations in a given age category results in a lower average number of tax returns as compared to the same age category in the prior year 
our retail partner locations typically prepare fewer tax returns as they tend to be smaller in size than typical storefront locations

since our ipo  we maintain our cash and cash equivalents  fund our operations and enter into investing and financing activities independently 
with respect to financing activities  cendant historically received the benefit of our operating cash flow and funded our operations following the end of the tax season 
consequently  prior to our ipo  our financing activities consisted solely of the settlement of intercompany transactions with cendant 
seasonality of cash flows the tax preparation business is highly seasonal  and we generate substantially all of our revenues during the tax season  which is the period from january through april as a result  we generate most of our operating funds during the tax season 
certain of our expenses are also highly seasonal in nature  including our marketing and advertising expenses as well as the costs to operate our company owned offices  both of which increase shortly before and continue through the tax season 
during the period from may through december  we require funds to cover our operating expenses as well as to reinvest in our business for future growth 
we expect to fund our operations through our operating cash flow and through our credit facility  as required 
repayment of long term debt and the establishment of a million credit facility on june   we repaid in full the million notes 
to repay the million notes  we used cash provided by operations of million and borrowed million under our million five year revolving credit facility the million credit facility that was established in june we incurred a non cash charge of million related to the write off of deferred financing costs associated with the repayment of the million notes and termination of our million credit facility noted below 
on june   we established a million five year unsecured credit facility the million credit facility that made many of the covenants less restrictive than the covenants in our prior debt agreements and reduced the cost of debt 
we repaid in full million that was outstanding under our million credit facility with proceeds from our million credit facility and then terminated the million credit facility 
borrowings under the million credit facility are to be used to finance working capital needs  potential acquisitions and other general corporate purposes including repurchases of our common stock 
the million credit facility provides for loans in the form of eurodollar or base rate borrowings 
eurodollar borrowings bear interest at the libor  as defined in the million credit facility  plus a credit spread as defined  ranging from to per annum 
base rate borrowings  as defined in the million credit facility  bear interest primarily at the prime rate  as defined in the agreement

there was a million letter of credit outstanding under the million credit facility as of april  as required under a lease agreement for our corporate headquarters in new jersey which will be reduced to million in fiscal  million in fiscal and terminates thereafter 
to the extent we complete any acquisitions  or as we continue to grow  we may require additional debt or equity financing to meet our capital needs 
our liquidity position may be negatively affected by unfavorable conditions in the market in which we operate 
in addition  our inability to generate sufficient profits during tax season may unfavorably impact our funding requirements

critical accounting policies in presenting our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported therein 
events that are outside of our control cannot be predicted and  as such  they cannot be contemplated in evaluating such estimates and assumptions 
if there is a significant unfavorable change to current conditions  it could result in a material adverse impact to our consolidated results of operations  financial position and liquidity 
we believe that the estimates and assumptions we used when preparing our consolidated financial statements were the most appropriate at that time 
the following critical accounting policies may affect reported results resulting in variations in our financial results both on an interim and fiscal year basis 
goodwill we have reviewed the carrying value of our goodwill by comparing the carrying value of our reporting units to their fair value and determined that the carrying amounts of our reporting units did not exceed their respective fair values in fiscal when determining fair value  we utilized various assumptions  including projections of future cash flows 
a change in these underlying assumptions would cause a change in the results of the tests and  as such  could cause fair value to be less than the respective carrying amount 
in such event  we would then be required to record a charge  which would impact results 
we will continue to review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment annually  or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred 
an adverse change to our business will impact our consolidated results and may result in an impairment of our goodwill 
the aggregate carrying value of our goodwill was million as of april  see item note goodwill and other intangible assets  net to our consolidated financial statements for more information on goodwill 
other intangible assets indefinite lived intangible assets are carried at the lower of cost or fair value 
if the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset is less than the carrying amount  an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to the difference 
we will continue to review the carrying value of indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually  or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred 
an adverse change to our business will impact our consolidated results and may result in an impairment of our indefinite lived intangible assets 
the aggregate carrying value of our indefinite lived intangible assets was million as of april  see item note goodwill and other intangible assets  net to our consolidated financial statements for more information on indefinite lived intangible assets
