item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we continued to focus on three significant priorities in protect our financial health  improve profitability  and invest in our future 
we made significant progress on all three in financial health during  we strengthened our balance sheet and delivered positive cash flows from operating activities 
the following are key accomplishments for 
as part of a debt reduction program  we reduced the net amount of our outstanding debt by million through a combination of retirements and scheduled repayments 

all three rating agencies upgraded our ratings to investment grade 

we received million in deposits against orders relating to our multi year supply agreements with customers in the display technologies segment 
these agreements have helped us to meet the rapid growth of the liquid crystal display lcd market 

we generated sufficient cash flows from operating activities to cover our capital expenditures 
we ended with billion in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
this represents an increase of million from december  in the first quarter of  we entered into a new revolving credit facility with a group of banks 
this facility  which continues through march  provides us access to a million unsecured multi currency revolving line of credit 
we believe we have sufficient liquidity for the next several years to fund operations  capital expenditures and scheduled debt repayments 
profitability for the year ended december   we generated net income of million or per share compared to a net loss of  million or per share for we recorded restructuring  impairment  and other charges and credits in and which affect the comparability of those years 
refer to note restructuring  impairment and other charges and credits  note income taxes  and note investments to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
investing in our future we remain committed to investing in research  development  and engineering to drive innovation 
we are investing in a wide variety of technologies with a focus on glass substrates for active matrix lcds  diesel filters and substrates in response to tightening emissions control standards  and the optical fiber and cable and hardware and equipment that will enable fiber to the premises 
our research  development and engineering expenditures have increased by million or compared to we believe our spending levels are adequate to support our growth strategies 
we also remain committed to investing in manufacturing capacity to match increased demand in our businesses 
our capital expenditures are primarily focused on expanding manufacturing capacity for lcd glass substrates in the display technologies segment and diesel products in the environmental technologies segment 
total capital expenditures for were  million  of which  million was directed toward our display technologies segment and million was invested in our environmental technologies segment primarily in anticipation of the emerging market for diesel emission control systems 
we expect our capital spending to be in the range of billion to billion  of which million to billion will be directed toward our display technologies segment and approximately million will be directed toward our environmental technologies segment

net sales for our life sciences segment declined due to changes in the distribution channels 
movements in foreign exchange rates did not significantly impact the comparison of net sales between and the net sales increase in was the result of strong demand for glass substrates in our display technologies segment  demand for hardware and equipment products in our telecommunications segment  and improvements across the majority of our other businesses 
these improvements were partially offset by the exit of our photonic technologies and us conventional television glass businesses

 goodwill and other intangible assets  sfas goodwill is required to be tested for impairment annually at the reporting unit level 
in addition  goodwill should be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its related carrying value 
in the third quarter of  we identified certain factors that caused us to lower our estimates and projections for the long term revenue growth of the telecommunications segment  which indicated that the fair value of the telecommunications segment reporting unit was less than its carrying value 
we performed an interim impairment test of the telecommunications segment goodwill in the third quarter of and  as a result  recorded an impairment charge of  million to reduce the carrying value of goodwill to its implied fair value at september  of million 
impairment of long lived assets other than goodwill given our restructuring actions and the market conditions facing certain of our businesses  at various times throughout to  we performed evaluations of the recoverability of our held for use long lived assets other than goodwill 
when an impairment evaluation was required  we developed expected future cash flows against which to compare the carrying value of the asset group being evaluated 
if our projections indicated that our long lived assets were not recoverable through future cash flows  we were then required to estimate the fair value of the long lived assets  which were limited to property  plant and equipment  using the expected cash flow approach as a measure of fair value 
impairment charge assets to be disposed of by sale or abandonment in  we recorded million of charges related to adjustments to prior year restructuring reserves for our telecommunications segment 
impairment charge assets to be disposed of by sale or abandonment these charges comprise the following 
telecommunications segment in  we recorded a net charge of million to impair plant and equipment related to certain facilities to be disposed of or shutdown 
approximately million of this net charge was comprised of the partially completed sections of our concord  nc optical fiber facility 
as a result of our lowered outlook  we have permanently abandoned this construction in progress as we no longer believe the demand for optical fiber will warrant the investment necessary to complete this facility 
we have mothballed and will continue to depreciate the separate previously operated portion of the concord fiber facility 

other businesses we recorded net credits of million  primarily for gains on the sale of assets cav sold to a third party in china 
this represented proceeds in excess of assumed salvage values for assets previously impaired 
this represented the substantial completion of the sale of cav s assets 
assets to be held and used due to our decision to permanently abandon certain assets and lower our long term outlook for the telecommunications segment in  we determined that an event of impairment had occurred in our telecommunications segment which required us to test the segment s long lived assets other than goodwill for impairment 
as a result of this impairment evaluation  we recorded a million impairment charge in the third quarter of to write down certain assets to fair value 
impairment charge assets to be disposed of by sale or abandonment these charges comprise the following 
telecommunications segment we recorded charges of million to impair plant and equipment related to the shutdown of a cabling plant and the final exit of the photonic technologies business 
the charges were more than offset by a million credit related to previous restructuring plans  primarily the result of our decision not to exit two of the cable sites previously marked for shutdown in 
other businesses we recorded charges of million  primarily related to our decision to shutdown cav  and the closure of our north brookfield semiconductor materials plant 
other credits reversal of currency translation adjustment in  corning sold its photonic business operations to avanex 
the photonics business was the sole operation of corning oti oti oti  a wholly owned italian subsidiary of corning  whose results were included in corning s telecommunications segment 
subsequent to the sale of the operating assets of oti to avanex  corning began liquidating oti 
in october  the assets of oti were determined to be substantially liquidated 
as a result of the substantial liquidation  oti s cumulative translation account was reversed  resulting in a gain of million in the fourth quarter 
accelerated depreciation accelerated depreciation we recorded million of accelerated depreciation relating to the final shutdown of our semiconductor materials manufacturing facility in charleston  south carolina  which we announced in the fourth quarter of accelerated depreciation we recorded million of accelerated depreciation as a result of our decision to shutdown our semiconductor materials manufacturing facility in charleston  south carolina by march  loss on sale of businesses loss on sale of business on september  we completed the sale of our frequency controls business  which was part of the telecommunications segment  for net cash proceeds of million 
we recorded a loss on the sale of million  which included an allocation of million of the telecommunications segment goodwill 
the frequency controls business had annual sales of million 
loss on sale of business in the third quarter of  we recorded a million loss on the sale of a significant portion of our photonic technologies business  which was part of our telecommunications segment 
impairment of available for sale securities impairment charge in  we recorded impairment charges of million for an other than temporary decline in the fair value of our investment in avanex corporation avanex below its adjusted cost basis 
our investment in avanex was accounted for as an available for sale security under sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas 
in the fourth quarter of  we completed the sale of our shares of avanex 
impairment charge in  we recorded a million charge for other than temporary declines in certain cost investments in the telecommunications segment  subsequently sold these investments for million in cash  and reported the resulting million gain as a credit to restructuring actions 
restructuring actions restructuring actions corning recorded net restructuring charges of million in which included the following 
a charge of million comprising severance costs for a restructuring plan in the telecommunications segment to continue to reduce costs in this segment 

net credits to prior year restructuring plans totaling million primarily for revisions to plans related to the shutdown of cav and to our specialty materials business 
restructuring actions there were no significant restructuring actions taken during  nor were there any significant revisions to estimates used in prior year restructuring plans 
restructuring actions corning recorded net restructuring charges of million in major actions approved and initiated in included the following 
the shutdown of cav 

the exit of our photonics products within the telecommunications segment 

credits to prior year restructuring plans  primarily the result of our decision not to exit two small cabling sites previously identified for shutdown in 
the shutdown of two of our specialty materials manufacturing facilities in north brookfield and charleston  south carolina 
legal settlement asbestos on march   we announced that we had reached agreement with the representatives of current and future asbestos claimants on a settlement arrangement that was thereafter incorporated into the pittsburgh corning corporation pcc plan of reorganization the pcc plan 
this settlement remains subject to a number of contingencies  including approval by the bankruptcy court 
if the pcc plan is approved and becomes effective  our settlement will require the contribution of our equity interest in pcc  our one half equity interest in pittsburgh corning europe nv pce  and million shares of our common stock 
the common stock will be marked to market each quarter until the pcc plan is approved  thus resulting in adjustments to income and the settlement liability as appropriate 
corning will also make cash payments of million net present value as of december  in six installments beginning one year after the plan is effective 
in addition  we will assign insurance policy proceeds from our primary insurance and a portion of our excess insurance as part of the settlement 
two of corning s primary insurers and several excess insurers have commenced litigation for a declaration of the rights and obligations of the parties under insurance policies  including rights that may be affected by the settlement arrangement described above 
corning is vigorously contesting these cases 
management is unable to predict the outcome of this insurance litigation 
the pcc plan received a favorable vote from creditors in march hearings to consider objections to the pcc plan were held in the bankruptcy court in may the parties filed post hearing briefs and made oral arguments to the bankruptcy court in november the bankruptcy court allowed an additional round of briefing to address current case law developments and heard additional oral arguments on march  in mid april  the proponents of the pcc plan requested that the court rule on the pending objections 
if the bankruptcy court does not approve the pcc plan in its current form  changes to the plan are probable as it is likely that the court will allow the proponents time to propose amendments 
the outcome of these proceedings is uncertain  and confirmation of the current plan or any amended plan is subject to a number of contingencies 
however  apart from the quarterly mark to market adjustment in the value of the million shares of corning stock  management believes that the likelihood of a material adverse impact to corning s financial statements is remote 
the following summarizes the charges we have recorded for the asbestos settlement in millions for the years ended december  initial settlement charge mark to market common stock asbestos settlement see legal proceedings for a history of this matter 
income loss from continuing operations before income taxes in addition to the drivers identified under gross margin  restructuring  impairment and other charges and credits and asbestos settlement  we also retired a significant amount of our outstanding debentures during  and that resulted in the following losses gains for the respective periods in millions loss gain on retirement of debt movements in currency exchange rates did not have a significant impact on income loss from continuing operations for the years presented 
provision benefit for income taxes our provision benefit for income taxes and the related effective income tax benefit rates were as follows in millions for the years ended december  provision benefit for income taxes  effective income tax benefit rate the effective income tax benefit rate for differed from the us statutory rate of primarily due to an increase in income tax expense of million resulting from an increase in corning s valuation allowance 
the increase in the valuation allowance was the result of our conclusion that the sale of an appreciated asset was no longer prudent and  as such  no longer meets the criteria in sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 
for a viable tax planning strategy 
the difference between the effective income tax benefit rate for and the us statutory rate of was primarily due to increases in the valuation allowance against certain domestic us federal  state and local and foreign deferred tax assets  and the write off of nondeductible goodwill 
for  the tax provision reflected the following items 
the impact of our inability to record tax benefits on net operating losses generated in the us and certain foreign jurisdictions  
an increase in our valuation allowance of million  
the benefit of a worthless stock deduction and a corresponding increase in our valuation allowance for the loss on our investment in the photonic technologies business associated with the pirelli acquisition which was completed in december and was substantially impaired in the second quarter of  
the benefit of tax holidays and investment credits in taiwan and tax holidays in china and south africa  
the benefit from the reversal of tax contingency liabilities following the conclusion of internal revenue service irs examinations  and 
an million credit primarily for the tax effect of eliminating our minimum pension liability for the domestic qualified plan 
in  significant events occurred which required us to increase our valuation allowances against certain us and german deferred tax assets 
refer to note restructuring  impairment and other charges and credits for additional information on these events and the related charges 
accordingly  we increased our valuation allowance by billion in the third quarter of to reduce our net deferred tax assets to approximately million 
at that time  we believed that it was more likely than not that we could realize the remaining net deferred tax assets through a tax planning strategy involving the sale of our investment in dow corning corporation dcc  a non strategic appreciated asset  if we were faced with expiring net operating loss carryforwards 
during  dcc s performance was much stronger than expected and dcc resumed paying a dividend  both of which are expected to continue in the future 
due to this improved performance  dcc now provides strong financial  geographic and market balance to corning s portfolio of businesses  the profitability of which has become more concentrated due to the success of the display operating segment 
as a result  we now consider dcc to be a strategic investment and can no longer assert that a potential tax planning strategy involving the sale of dcc would be prudent  as required by fas therefore  we no longer believe that it is more likely than not that we would realize the remaining net deferred tax assets 
accordingly  we have increased our valuation allowance by million to fully reserve our net us deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter of we expect to maintain a valuation allowance on future tax benefits until an appropriate level of profitability  primarily in the us and germany  is sustained or we are able to develop tax planning strategies that enable us to conclude that it is more likely than not that a portion of our deferred tax assets would be realizable 
until then  our tax provision will include only the net tax expense attributable to certain foreign operations 
refer to note income taxes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
during the third quarter of  corning filed its consolidated us federal income tax return  which included a billion worthless stock deduction for the loss on our investment in the photonic technologies business associated with the pirelli acquisition 
this acquisition was completed in december and was substantially impaired in the second quarter of prior to the third quarter of  we did not record a deferred tax asset for this item as the ultimate realization of such deduction was uncertain  and consistent with the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  recognition of an asset prior to the time management determines the realization of the asset is probable is prohibited 
on september   corning and the commissioner of the irs entered into a closing agreement under section of the internal revenue code of which provides that corning is entitled to this worthless stock deduction 
we recorded a billion deferred tax asset for this item in the third quarter  which was concurrently offset by a valuation allowance of an equal amount due to our current inability to record tax benefits for us net operating losses 
certain foreign subsidiaries in china  south africa  korea and taiwan are operating under tax holiday arrangements 
the nature and extent of such arrangements vary  and the benefits of such arrangements phase out in future years to according to the specific terms and schedules of the relevant taxing jurisdictions 
the impact of the tax holidays on our effective rate is a reduction in the rate of   and for   and  respectively 
equity in earnings of associated companies  net of impairments the following provides a summary of equity earnings of associated companies  net of impairments in millions samsung corning precision dow corning samsung corning all other total equity earnings the and increases in equity earnings of associated companies  net of impairments  are primarily due to strong sales and earnings performance at samsung precision  our owned south korea based manufacturer of lcd glass  and at dow corning  our owned us based manufacturer of silicone products 
in addition to the above  equity in earnings of associated companies  net of impairments  included the following restructuring and impairment charges and other credits 
in  samsung corning incurred impairment and other charges as a result of a decline in the projected operating results for its cathode ray tube crt glass business 
the charge  which included certain manufacturing assets and severance and exit costs  reduced corning s equity earnings by million in the third quarter 
as samsung corning executes its restructuring plan over the next several quarters  additional severance and shutdown costs may be required 
we expect our share of these charges to approximate million 
none of the charges is expected to result in cash expenditures by corning 

in  dow corning recorded a gain on the issuance of subsidiary stock 
our equity earnings included million related to this gain 

in and  corning incurred charges of million and million  respectively  to impair equity method investments in the telecommunications segment to their estimated fair value 

in  dow corning recorded charges related to restructuring actions and adjustments to interest liabilities recorded on its emergence from bankruptcy 
our equity earnings included million related to these charges 

in  samsung corning co  ltd 
recorded asset impairment charges 
our equity earnings included million related to these charges 
income loss from continuing operations as a result of the above  the income loss from continuing operations and per share data was as follows in millions  except per share amounts for the years ended december  income loss from continuing operations  basic earnings loss per common share from continuing operations diluted earnings loss per common share from continuing operations shares used in computing basic per share amounts    shares used in computing diluted per share amounts    results of discontinued operations in the third quarter of  corning and m reached a final settlement agreement for funds held in escrow associated with the sale of corning s precision lens business to m 
as a result  we recognized a million gain upon receipt of the proceeds in operating segments our reportable operating segments include display technologies  telecommunications  environmental technologies  and life sciences 
the environmental technologies reportable segment is an aggregation of our automotive and diesel operating segments  as these two segments share similar economic characteristics  products  customer types  production processes and distribution methods 
the following provides a brief description of the products and markets served by each reportable segment 
display technologies manufactures liquid crystal display glass for flat panel displays  
telecommunications manufactures optical fiber and cable  and hardware and equipment components for the worldwide telecommunications industry  
environmental technologies manufactures ceramic substrates and filters for automobile and diesel applications  and 
life sciences manufactures glass and plastic consumables for scientific applications 
we prepared the financial results for our reportable segments on a basis that is consistent with the manner in which we internally disaggregate financial information to assist in making internal operating decisions 
we include the earnings of equity affiliates that are closely associated with our operating segments in the respective segment s net income 
we have allocated certain common expenses among segments differently than we would for stand alone financial information prepared in accordance with gaap 
these expenses include interest  taxes and corporate functions 
segment net income may not be consistent with measures used by other companies 
the accounting policies of our reportable segments are the same as those applied in the consolidated financial statements 
on january   corning changed its measurement of segment profit or loss as follows 
we removed the net impact of financing costs  such as interest expense on debt instruments and interest costs associated with benefit plans  from reportable segments and included these amounts in corporate unallocated expense 

we changed the allocation method for taxes to more closely reflect the company s current tax position 

we removed the impact of non cash stock compensation expense from reportable segments and included this amount in corporate unallocated expense 

we removed the allocation of exploratory research  development and engineering expense from reportable segments and included these amounts in corporate unallocated expense 

we changed certain other allocation methods for corporate functions 
the following discussion reflects segment information as reported for and has not been restated to reflect the changes to segment performance measurement made effective january  refer to note subsequent events for additional information on the change in segment profit or loss measurement 
display technologies the following table provides net sales and other data for the display technologies segment dollars in millions change vs

net sales   income before equity earnings equity earnings of associated companies net income  vs 
the sales increase reflects the continued overall growth of the lcd glass substrate market 
during  glass substrate volumes measured in square feet of glass sold increased approximately compared with the same period in weighted average selling prices decreased compared to included in this weighted average were selling price declines that were offset by increases in the market demand for large size glass substrates generation and above  which carry a higher selling price per square foot 
for  large size glass substrates accounted for of total sales volumes  compared to in although sales of the display technologies segment are denominated in japanese yen  movements in the us dollar japanese yen exchange rate did not have a significant impact on the comparability of sales 
for  the key drivers for the increase in income before equity earnings were higher volumes  ongoing improvements in manufacturing efficiencies  and a lower effective tax rate 
movements in currency exchange rates did not have a significant impact on income before equity earnings 
the increase in our equity earnings from samsung corning precision was largely driven by higher volumes and ongoing improvements in manufacturing efficiencies 
the display technologies segment has a concentrated customer base comprised of lcd panel and color filter makers primarily located in japan and taiwan 
for the year ended december   au optronics corporation  chi mei optoelectronics corporation  dai nippon printing co  ltd  sharp corporation  and hannstar display corporation  each of which accounted for more than of segment net sales  accounted for of total segment sales 
in addition  samsung corning precision s sales are concentrated across a small number of its customers 
in  sales to three lcd panel makers located in korea  samsung electronics co  ltd  lg phillips lcd co  and dong woo sti  accounted for of total samsung corning precision sales 
in and  corning and several customers entered into long term purchase and supply agreements in which the display technologies segment will supply large size glass substrates to the customers over periods of up to six years 
as part of the agreements  these customers agreed to make advance cash deposits to corning for a portion of the contracted glass to be purchased 
in and  we received a total of million and million  respectively  of deposits against orders 
in the event the customers do not make all customer deposit installment payments or elect not to purchase the agreed upon quantities of product  subject to specific conditions outlined in the agreements  corning may retain certain amounts of the customer deposits 
if corning does not deliver agreed upon product quantities  subject to specific conditions outlined in the agreements  corning may be required to return certain amounts of the customer deposits 
refer to note summary of significant accounting policies and note other accrued liabilities to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
in the ordinary course of business  corning will continue to negotiate multi year supply agreements with its large customers where feasible but we believe it is unlikely that we will negotiate agreements which require additional deposits 
corning is investing heavily to expand capacity to meet increasing demand for lcd glass substrates 
in  capital spending was billion and is expected to be million to billion in capital spending in will be used mainly to expand manufacturing facilities in tainan  taiwan  taichung  taiwan  and shizuoka  japan 
vs 
the sales increase is largely reflective of the overall lcd market growth 
during  glass substrate volumes increased approximately 
sales also benefited from modest average price increases  primarily the result of a change in product mix as the market trended toward large size glass 
sales benefited by approximately from a weakening of the us dollar against the japanese yen compared to for  the key drivers for the increase in income before equity earnings were the impact of incremental volumes and efficiencies realized through the shift in production toward large size glass substrates 
the increase in equity earnings were driven by the same factors as those identified for our wholly owned business 
outlook we expect to see a continuation of the overall industry growth and the trend toward large size substrates 
we continue to see positive trends in the penetration rates of lcd glass into the end markets notebook computers  monitors and televisions  and increasing demand for the large size substrates 
however  we expect the growth of lcd glass to be more heavily influenced by the penetration of lcd in the television end market 
we anticipate the volume growth in the lcd market to be over in we expect the market volume for large size glass substrates generation and higher to grow more than in as a result of the expected growth in large size substrates  we believe our total glass volume will grow faster than the overall lcd market in this market growth is expected to occur at varying rates in the principal lcd markets of japan  taiwan and korea 
sales of our wholly owned business are primarily to panel manufacturers in japan and taiwan with customers in korea being serviced by samsung corning precision 
the actual growth rates in these markets will impact our sales and earnings performance 
for  we anticipate price declines that are more significant than experienced in previous years as competitors bring on additional capacity 
in the third quarter of  we began production at our new taichung  taiwan manufacturing facility 
the ramp up of production and our ability to efficiently start up operations may impact profitability the first half of in addition  we are beginning to see increased amounts of larger sized glass in the marketplace from competitors 
there can be no assurance that the end market rates of growth will continue at the high rates experienced in recent quarters or that we will be able to pace our capacity expansions to actual demand 
although we believe we can continue to reduce our manufacturing costs  there can be no assurance that the rate of cost declines will offset price declines in any given period 
while the industry has grown rapidly  consumer preferences for panels of differing sizes  or price or other factors  may lead to pauses in market growth  and it is possible that glass manufacturing capacity may exceed demand from time to time 
in addition  changes in foreign exchange rates  principally the japanese yen  will continue to impact the sales and profitability of this segment 
telecommunications the following table provides net sales and other data for the telecommunications segment dollars in millions change vs 
vs 
net sales optical fiber and cable hardware and equipment photonic technologies total net sales    net income loss   vs 
results for the telecommunications segment reflected a solid performance in the net sales increase was largely driven by sales in north america and europe 
stronger north american volumes and sales of the hardware and equipment business were largely the result of sales to verizon to support their fiber to the premises project 
excluding the impact of the frequency controls business  a hardware and equipment manufacturer sold in september  net sales for the telecommunications segment increased in when compared to the previous year 
movements in exchange rates did not significantly impact sales for either or for the telecommunications segment  net income in and the net loss in were impacted by restructuring  impairment  and other charges and credits 
in  we recorded net after tax credits of million related to these items and in  we recorded after tax charges of  million 
refer to results of continuing operations for a detailed discussion of these charges 
the telecommunications segment continues to have a concentrated customer base 
for the year ended december   two customers of the telecommunications segment  each of which accounted for more than of segment net sales  represented of total segment sales 
for and  verizon accounted for and  respectively  of total segment net sales 
vs 
during fiber volumes grew at while pricing declined by from levels 
the primary driver for the sales growth was verizon s fiber to the premises project in north america  with the largest benefit realized in our hardware and equipment products 
offsetting this sales performance were the following items 
during we completed the sale and exit of our photonic technologies business 

on september   we sold our frequency controls business 
this business had annual sales of million in 
sales in japan were down in  largely due to projects that were not repeated in movements in foreign currency exchange rates  primarily the japanese yen and euro  did not have a significant impact on sales compared to in  the chinese ministry of commerce issued an anti dumping preliminary determination asserting that corning had dumped optical fiber into china during and and imposed a duty on corning s optical fiber imports which corning later contested 
although the ministry of commerce  in december  concluded that corning had not dumped optical fiber into china  and removed the duty  corning s market share in china was negatively impacted 
the increased net loss for is primarily attributable to the goodwill  fixed asset and equity method investments impairment charges recorded in the third quarter of refer to results of continuing operations for additional information on these charges 
outlook for the telecommunications segment  we expect sales in to remain even with as volume gains are offset by price declines 
we expect the worldwide telecommunications industry market to remain stable particularly in north america 
sales volumes will largely be dependent on the continuation of verizon s fiber to the premises project and cable and hardware and equipment sales to private networks 
changes in the expected verizon deployment plan  or additional reductions in their inventory levels of fiber to the premises products  could also affect the sales level 
should these plans not occur at the pace anticipated our sales and earnings would be adversely affected 
environmental technologies the following table provides net sales and other data for the environmental technologies segment dollars in millions change vs 
vs 
net sales automotive diesel total net sales net loss income vs 
the increase in net sales was the result of continued growth in diesel products sales in response to tightening emissions control standards around the world 
diesel products sales growth is currently driven  in part  by demand from retrofit markets  particularly in korea 
in the first half of  we received letters of intent and other expressions of intent from diesel engine manufacturers to supply filters for their model year platforms 
we are continuing to negotiate with several diesel engine manufacturers to develop supply agreements 
negotiations are likely to continue through the first half of for automotive products  sales in were flat when compared to prior year 
the decrease in net income compared to resulted primarily from increased operating expenses primarily to support our emerging diesel products 
movements in exchange rates did not significantly impact net sales or net income of this segment in when compared to the environmental technologies segment sells to a concentrated customer base of manufacturers of catalyzers and emission control systems  who then sell to automotive and diesel engine manufacturers 
although our sales are to the emission control systems manufacturers  the use of our substrates and filters are generally required by the specifications of the automotive and diesel engine manufacturers 
for  three customers of the environmental technologies segment  each of which accounted for more than of segment net sales  accounted for of total segment sales 
vs 
the increase in net sales was primarily the result of demand for our automotive and diesel ceramic filters and substrates 
volumes for our automotive products were up slightly from and sales benefited from a higher mix of our thin wall and ultra thin wall substrates  which allow engine manufacturers to meet their emissions control requirements in a more cost effective manner 
diesel products sales growth was primarily driven by demand from retrofit markets  although we experienced a softening in asian retrofit markets in the second half of movements in exchange rates did not have a significant impact on sales or net income for compared to the decline in net income is primarily the result of increased development costs and plant start up costs to support our emerging diesel products 
these costs offset the gross margin benefits of increased volumes and the higher mix of premium automotive products 
outlook we expect sales to increase in for automotive products  we expect to see stable demand based on anticipated worldwide auto production 
although volumes are anticipated to be stable  a slowdown in auto production  particularly in north america  could adversely impact our growth projections 
diesel product sales are expected to grow as diesel engine manufacturers ramp up production for the model years 
the growth rate of diesel product sales in is very dependent on the emission standards for heavy duty engines in the united states continuing to be in place 
the net loss for the segment is expected to be only slightly lower in as we continue to spend heavily on research  development and engineering for diesel products

the decrease in net sales is due largely to volume decreases as a result of a change in our distribution channel that was made in early prior to  approximately of the life sciences segment sales were to two distributors  who in turn sold to end users such as pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  government entities  academic institutions and other research facilities 
as a result of a change in business strategy by one of the distributors  corning did not renew the distribution agreement 
approximately of life sciences sales were made through this distributor 
we have been successful in transitioning the majority of the sales through this distributor to our remaining primary distributor and other existing and developing channels 
as anticipated  however  the change had a negative impact on sales volumes in approximately of sales continued to be made through the remaining primary distributor 
the net loss in was due to lower sales and higher operating expenses to implement the change in distribution channels and to support new product development efforts 
movement in foreign exchange rates did not have a significant impact on the comparability of this segment s net sales or net income for and vs 
the increase in net sales is primarily due to volume increases across the majority of our product lines 
demand from research  development and production end users remained steady for  which represented an improvement over the industry wide softness experienced in movements in foreign exchange rates  primarily the euro  did not have a significant impact on sales for compared to the decrease in net income is largely attributable to gross margin improvements resulting from the increase in sales volume being substantially offset by new product development costs 
in addition  in net income benefited from a gain recognized on the disposition of a minor product line 
movement in exchange rates did not significantly impact net income 
outlook sales for are expected to increase modestly as we continue to regain volume and due to price increases in the first quarter of we expect a lower net loss for as a result of higher sales and a reduction in operating expenses offset somewhat by a slightly higher level of research  development and engineering spending

liquidity and capital resources financing activities during  we had a number of significant financing transactions 
in separate transactions  we redeemed or repurchased million of debentures for a combination of million cash and million shares of corning common stock  resulting in an increase to equity of million 
we recognized losses totaling million associated with the debt redemptions 
in addition  we issued million of senior unsecured notes for proceeds of approximately million and we completed a common stock offering of million shares for net proceeds of approximately million 
we also contributed million shares of corning common stock to our us pension plan resulting in an increase to equity of million 
as a result of these transactions  and our operating cash flow in excess of capital expenditures  we ended the year with cash and short term investments in excess of debt on our balance sheet 
refer to note debt to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
in the first quarter of we entered a written agreement with a group of banks on a new revolving credit facility 
the new facility provides us access to a million unsecured multi currency revolving line of credit and expires in march the facility includes two financial covenants  a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio  both of which we are in compliance and also includes restrictions on the declaration of dividends 
concurrent with the closing of this credit facility  we terminated our previous billion revolving line of credit that was set to expire in august customer deposits certain customers of our display technologies segment have entered into long term supply agreements and agreed to make advance cash deposits to secure supply of large size glass substrates 
the deposits will be reduced through future product purchases  thus reducing operating cash flows in later periods as credits are applied for cash deposits received in earlier periods 
customer deposits have been or will be received in the following periods in millions estimated and beyond total customer deposits received the majority of the remaining customer deposits will be received through in  we issued million in credit memoranda

capital spending activity in  and primarily included expansion of lcd capacity in the display technologies segment and new capacity for diesel products in the environmental technologies segment 
our capital spending program is expected to be in the range of billion to billion  of which million to billion will be to expand manufacturing capacity for lcd glass substrates in the display technologies segment 
these expenditures primarily relate to previously announced expansion plans for our existing manufacturing facilities in tainan  taiwan  taichung  taiwan  and shizuoka  japan 
additionally  approximately million will be directed toward our environmental technologies segment to support the emerging diesel emissions control products

off balance sheet arrangements off balance sheet arrangements are transactions  agreements or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity that corning has an obligation to that are not recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
corning s off balance sheet arrangements include the following 
guarantee contracts that require applying the measurement provisions of fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin  and 
variable interests held in certain unconsolidated entities 
fin requires a company  at the time a guarantee is issued  to recognize a liability for the fair value or market value of the obligation it assumes 
in the normal course of our business  we do not routinely provide significant third party guarantees 
generally  third party guarantees provided by corning are limited to certain financial guarantees  including stand by letters of credit and performance bonds  and the incurrence of contingent liabilities in the form of purchase price adjustments related to attainment of milestones 
these guarantees have various terms  and none of these guarantees are individually significant 
refer to note commitments  contingencies and guarantees to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
corning has variable interests in three variable interest entities from which corning leases transportation equipment 
for variable interest entities  we assess the terms of our interest in the entity to determine if we are the primary beneficiary as prescribed by fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 revised fin r 
the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is the party that absorbs a majority of the entity s expected losses  receives a majority of its expected residual returns  or both  as a result of holding variable interests  which are the ownership  contractual  or other pecuniary interests in an entity that change with changes in the fair value of the entity s net assets excluding variable interests 
we consolidate one variable interest entity in which we are the primary beneficiary 
corning leases certain transportation equipment from a trust that qualifies as a variable interest entity under fin r 
the sole purpose of this entity is leasing transportation equipment to corning 
since corning is the primary beneficiary of this entity  the financial statements of the entity are included in corning s consolidated financial statements 
corning leases certain transportation equipment from two additional trusts that qualify as variable interest entities under fin r 
corning is not the primary beneficiary of these entities 
the sole purpose of the entities is leasing transportation equipment to corning 
corning has been involved with these entities as lessee since the inception of the trusts

sfas no 
 paragraph a states that contracts that are indexed to an entity s own stock and classified in the shareholders equity section of the consolidated financial statements are not considered derivative instruments and are therefore excluded from the balance sheet 
although corning has contracts that are indexed to our own stock  these contracts are not classified within the shareholders equity section of the consolidated financial statements and therefore are considered derivative instruments and are accounted for as such

amounts above are stated at their maturity value 
the estimate of interest payments assumes interest is paid through the date of maturity expiration of the related debt  based upon stated rates in the respective debt instruments 
we have provided financial guarantees and contingent liabilities in the form of stand by letters of credit and performance bonds  some of which do not have fixed or scheduled expiration dates 
we have agreed to provide a credit facility related to dow corning as noted above and discussed in note investments and note commitments  contingencies  and guarantees to the consolidated financial statements 
the funding of the dow corning credit facility will be required only if dow corning is not otherwise able to meet its scheduled funding obligations in its confirmed bankruptcy plan 
we believe the significant majority of these guarantees and contingent liabilities will expire without being funded 
pensions we have a number of defined benefit pension plans covering certain domestic and international employees 
our largest single pension plan is corning s us qualified plan 
at december   this plan accounted for of our consolidated defined benefit pension plans projected benefit obligation and of the related plans assets 
in  although global equities had positive returns  interest rates continued to decline 
as a result  at december   the accumulated benefit obligation abo for our domestic qualified and non qualified plans and several international plans exceeded the fair value of related plan assets  requiring corning to record an additional minimum pension liability in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions 
however  in  due primarily to contributions of corning stock to the domestic qualified pension plan  the fair value of this plan s assets at december  exceeded the abo and  accordingly  corning eliminated this plan s minimum pension liability 
refer to note employee retirement plans to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
balances of these non cash adjustments follow in millions december  additional minimum pension liability intangible assets other accumulated comprehensive loss  pre tax other accumulated comprehensive loss  after tax we have traditionally contributed to the us qualified pension plan on an annual basis in excess of the irs minimum requirements  and as a result  mandatory contributions are not expected to be required for this plan until at least for  we issued and contributed million shares of corning common stock with a value of approximately million to our domestic pension plan 
in  we contributed million to our us pension plan 
we anticipate making voluntary contributions of approximately million in cash to our domestic and international pension plans in environment we have been named by the environmental protection agency under the superfund act  or by state governments under similar state laws  as a potentially responsible party for active hazardous waste sites 
under the superfund act  all parties who may have contributed any waste to a hazardous waste site  identified by such agency  are jointly and severally liable for the cost of cleanup unless the agency agrees otherwise 
it is our policy to accrue for the estimated liability related to superfund sites and other environmental liabilities related to property owned and operated by us based on expert analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants 
we have accrued approximately million undiscounted for the estimated liability for environmental cleanup and related litigation at december  based upon the information developed to date  we believe that the accrued amount is a reasonable estimate of our liability and that the risk of an additional loss in an amount materially higher than that accrued is remote 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein 
the estimates  including future projections of performance and relevant discount rates  that required us to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments follow 
impairment of goodwill sfas requires us to make certain difficult  subjective and complex judgments on a number of matters  including assumptions and estimates used to determine the fair value of our reporting units  which are the same as our segments 
we measure fair value on the basis of discounted expected future cash flows 
our estimates are based upon our historical experience  our current knowledge from our commercial relationships  and available external information about future trends 
telecommunications results for the telecommunications segment in were moderate as pricing in the telecommunications industry continues to decline 
we expect the worldwide telecommunications industry market to remain stable particularly in north america  and fiber volumes to increase modestly and pricing pressures to continue 
for our impairment test  we used a discount rate of in our calculation of fair value of the expected future cash flows 
the results of our tests indicated that goodwill was not impaired 
the results would not have changed had we used a discount rate of or 
in  an impairment charge of  million was recorded 
we used a discount rate for our annual impairment test 
had we used a discount rate of  the impairment charge would have been approximately million lower 
had we used a discount rate of  the impairment charge would have been approximately million higher 
terminal value of the business assumes a growth in perpetuity of 
business cash flows are also used to value intangible and tangible assets which determine the implied value of reporting unit goodwill 
the discount rate applied to these cash flows represents a telecommunications weighted average cost of capital based upon current debt and equity activity of public companies representing a cross section of worldwide competitors of the reporting unit 
growth in the telecommunications segment is dependent upon corning s success in delivering results in fiber to the premises applications 
increased fiber price pressure or lack of fiber to the premises penetration may precipitate additional goodwill charges in the future 
specialty materials our discounted cash flow test for this reporting unit assumes a growth in perpetuity of 
the discount rate applied to the forecasted cash flows represents weighed average cost of capital based upon current debt and equity activity of seven public companies representing a cross section of worldwide competitors of the reporting unit 
for the and impairment tests we used a risk adjusted discount rate of and in our calculation of the fair value of the expected future cash flows  respectively 
the results of our and tests indicated that goodwill was not impaired 
the results would not have changed had we used a discount rate of or for and or for impairment of assets held for use sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  requires us to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets when an event of impairment has occurred 
we must exercise judgment in assessing whether an event of impairment has occurred 
for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss  a long lived asset or assets is grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
we must exercise judgment in assessing the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
in certain circumstances  we concluded that locations or businesses which share production along the supply chain must be combined in order to appropriately identify cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
once it has been judged that an impairment has occurred  an impairment assessment requires exercise of judgment in assessing the future use of and projected value to be derived from the impaired assets to be held and used 
this may require judgment in estimating future cash flows and relevant discount rates and terminal values in estimating the current fair value of the impaired assets to be held and used 
in  based on our decision to permanently abandon certain assets and lower our outlook for the telecommunications segment  we determined an event of impairment had occurred in our telecommunications segment 
we performed an impairment test on the segment s long lived assets  and recorded a million charge to write down certain assets to their fair value 
in  we concluded events of impairment had occurred in our semiconductor materials product line  which is part of the specialty materials segment  and performed an impairment test 
the results of our test indicated that our long lived assets held for use were not impaired 
restructuring charges and impairments resulting from restructuring actions sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  requires us to assess whether and when a restructuring event has occurred and in which periods charges related to such events should be recognized 
we must estimate costs of plans to restructure including  for example  employee termination costs 
restructuring charges require us to exercise judgment about the expected future of our businesses  of portions thereof  their profitability  cash flows and in certain instances eventual outcome 
the judgment involved can be difficult  subjective and complex in a number of areas including assumptions and estimates used in estimating the future profitability and cash flows of our businesses 
restructuring events often give rise to decisions to dispose of or abandon certain assets or asset groups which  as a result  require impairment in accordance with sfas sfas requires us to carry assets to be sold or abandoned at the lower of cost or fair value 
we must exercise judgment in assessing the fair value of the assets to be sold or abandoned 
during and  we recorded write downs of property  plant and equipment as a result of decisions to exit facilities  primarily in the telecommunications segment 
assets impaired were primarily equipment  construction in progress and buildings  which were sold or abandoned 
we used information available from recent auctions of telecommunications equipment to estimate salvage value when measuring impairment 
the estimated salvage values were very low  primarily due to the depressed market for telecommunications related equipment 
the salvage values of property impaired were also estimated to be minimal as certain facilities will be abandoned and not sold 
it is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to reserves 
valuation allowances for deferred income taxes sfas  accounting for income taxes requires us to exercise judgment about our future results in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
inherent in this estimation process  especially since we are in a net gross deferred tax asset position  in part due to prior year net operating losses  is the requirement for us to estimate future book taxable income and possible tax planning strategies 
these estimates require us to exercise judgment about our future results and the prudence and feasibility of possible tax planning strategies 
as more fully discussed in note income taxes  corning determined that a tax planning strategy considered previously to be prudent was no longer prudent 
as such  a million adjustment was recorded in to increase the valuation allowance to fully reserve our us deferred tax assets 
if we sustain an appropriate level of profitability  primarily in the us and germany  or if we are able to develop tax planning strategies  adjustments to these allowances will be required and may affect future net income 
probability of litigation outcomes sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  sfas requires us to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain 
in making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters  we consider the evaluation of outside counsel knowledgeable about each matter  as well as known outcomes in case law 
see legal proceedings for a detailed discussion of the key litigation matters we face 
the most significant matter involving judgment is the pcc asbestos liability 
there are a number of factors bearing upon our potential liability  including the inherent complexity of a chapter filing  our history of success in defending ourselves against asbestos claims  our assessment of the strength of our corporate veil defenses  our continuing dialogue with our insurance carriers and the claimants representatives  and other factors 
we have reached a tentative settlement on pcc as disclosed in legal proceedings and note investments to the consolidated financial statements 
the settlement is subject to a number of contingencies  including approval by the bankruptcy court and resolution of any appeals 
other possible liabilities sfas and other similarly focused accounting literature requires us to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain 
in making determinations of likely outcomes of certain matters  including certain tax planning matters and environmental matters  these judgments require us to consider events and actions that are outside our control in determining whether probable or possible liabilities require accrual or disclosure 
pension and other postretirement employee benefits opeb pension and opeb costs and obligations are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
these assumptions include discount rates  health care cost trend rates  benefits earned  interest cost  expected return on plan assets  mortality rates  and other factors 
in accordance with gaap  actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods 
while management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect corning s pension and other postretirement obligations and future expense 
as of december   the projected benefit obligation pbo for us pension plans was  million and the minimum pension liability charges to equity with respect to us pension plans was million  net of tax 
the following information illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for us pension plans effect on effect on december  change in assumption pre tax pension expense pbo basis point decrease in discount rate million million basis point increase in discount rate million million basis point decrease in expected return on assets million basis point increase in expected return on assets million the above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time 
it should be noted that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear 
these changes in assumptions would have no effect on corning s funding requirements 
in addition  at december   a basis point decrease in the discount rate would decrease stockholders equity by million before tax  a basis point increase in the discount rate would increase stockholders equity by million 
with a basis point decrease in the discount rate  certain pension plans would become accumulated benefit obligation abo underfunded resulting in a significantly larger impact on equity compared to a basis point increase in the discount rate 
in addition  the impact of greater than a basis point decrease in discount rate would not be proportional to the first basis point decrease in the discount rate 
the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in the discount rate assumption related to corning s us opeb plans effect on effect on pre tax opeb december  change in assumption expense apbo basis point decrease in discount rate million million basis point increase in discount rate million million the above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time 
it should be noted that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear 
revenue recognition in certain instances  revenue recognition is based on estimates of fair value of deliverables as well as estimates of product returns  allowances  discounts and other factors 
while management believes that the estimates used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in estimates may affect corning s future results 
stock compensation stock based compensation expense and disclosures are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
these assumptions include risk free discount rates  expected term of the stock based compensation instrument granted  volatility of stock and option prices  expected time between grant date and date of exercise  attrition  performance  and other factors 
these assumptions require us to exercise judgment 
our estimates of these assumptions typically are based upon our historical experience and also currently available market place data 
while management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect corning s future stock based compensation expense and disclosures

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s we operate and conduct business in many foreign countries and as a result are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
our exposure to exchange rate effects includes 
exchange rate movements on financial instruments and transactions denominated in foreign currencies which impact earnings  and 
exchange rate movements upon conversion of net assets in foreign subsidiaries for which the functional currency is not the us dollar  which impact our net equity 
our most significant foreign currency exposure is the japanese yen and to a much lesser extent the korean won  the taiwan dollar  and the euro 
we selectively enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts with durations generally months or less to hedge our exposure to exchange rate risk on foreign source income and purchases 
these hedges are scheduled to mature coincident with the timing of the underlying foreign currency commitments and transactions 
the objective of these contracts is to neutralize the impact of exchange rate movements on our operating results 
we also enter into foreign exchange forward contracts when situations arise where our foreign subsidiaries or corning enter into lending situations  generally on an intercompany basis  denominated in currencies other than their local currency 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
in  corning began using derivative instruments forwards to limit the exposure to foreign currency fluctuations associated with certain monetary assets and liabilities 
these derivative instruments are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes and  as such  are referred to as undesignated hedges 
changes in the fair value of undesignated hedges  along with foreign currency gains and losses arising from the underlying monetary assets or liabilities  are recorded in current period earnings in the other income  net component in the consolidated statement of operations 
equity in earnings of associated companies has historically contributed a significant amount to our income from continuing operations 
equity in earnings of associated companies  net of impairments was million in and million in with foreign based affiliates comprising over of this amount 
equity earnings from samsung corning and samsung corning precision totaled million for and million for exchange rate fluctuations and actions taken by management of these entities can affect the earnings of these companies 
we use a sensitivity analysis to assess the market risk associated with our foreign currency exchange risk 
market risk is defined as the potential change in fair value of assets and liabilities resulting from an adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates 
at december   we had open forward contracts  open option contracts  and foreign denominated debt with values exposed to exchange rate movements  all of which were designated as hedges at december  a adverse movement in quoted foreign currency exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of million 
specific to the japanese yen  a adverse movement in quoted yen exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of million 
as we derive approximately of our net sales from outside the us  our sales and net income could be affected if the us dollar significantly strengthens or weakens against foreign currencies  most notably the japanese yen and euro 
our outlooks included in management s discussion and analysis assume exchange rates during remain constant at january levels 
a plus or minus point movement in the us dollar japanese yen exchange rate would result in a change to net sales of approximately million and net income of approximately million 
a plus or minus point movement in the us dollar euro exchange rate would result in a change to net sales of approximately million but would have a negligible effect on net income 
interest rate risk management it is our policy to conservatively manage our exposure to changes in interest rates 
our policy prescribes that total variable rate debt will not exceed of the total debt portfolio at anytime 
at december   our consolidated debt portfolio contained less than of variable rate instruments
