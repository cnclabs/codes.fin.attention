some of these investments include the following growing the client base and increasing utilization of ancillary services our client base increased to approximately  clients at may  this compares with approximately  clients at may   and approximately  clients at may  client growth was approximately for fiscal  compared with approximately for fiscal we have continued to invest in our direct sales force  as we believe there is opportunity for growth within our target market of small to medium sized businesses

business acquisitions we will supplement our growth through strategic acquisition when opportunities arise 
in the fiscal year ended may   we expanded our client base through the acquisitions of advantage payroll services  inc advantage and interpay  inc 
interpay 
in fiscal  the acquisition of substantially all the assets and certain liabilities of stromberg llc stromberg along with the acquisition of stromberg s time in a box product  allowed us to expand our product offering to include time and attendance solutions and thus offer value added products and services to payroll and non payroll clients 
we currently have no definitive agreements or current plans with respect to any material prospective acquisition 
focus on customer service we have always focused on customer service and the maximization of client retention 
fiscal client retention is at record levels of slightly less than of our beginning client base 
the most significant factor contributing to client losses is companies going out of business

mms revenue increased for both fiscal and fiscal to million and million  respectively 
approximately one third of our new mms clients are conversions from our core payroll service 
we had over  mms clients at may  human resource services revenue increased in fiscal and in fiscal as a result of higher revenue from the following services we have continued to see growth in the number of clients utilizing our retirement services product 
retirement services revenue increased for fiscal and for fiscal to million and million  respectively

table of contents sales of our paychex premier product  a comprehensive payroll and integrated human resource and employee benefits outsourcing solution for small to medium sized businesses  have been strong  as administrative fee revenue from this product increased for fiscal and for fiscal to million and million  respectively 
the increases in administrative fee revenue were driven primarily by client growth 
administrative fee revenue in fiscal also benefited from the implementation of initial enrollment fees  effective may  as of may   our paychex premier product serviced over  client employees  as compared with over  client employees at may  revenue from the peo product increased for fiscal and for fiscal to million and million  respectively 
this was the result of growth in clients and client employees served  price increases  and favorable fluctuations in workers compensation claims experience 
as of may   our peo product serviced approximately  client employees  as compared with over  client employees at may  our peo product provides essentially the same services as paychex premier  except we serve as a co employer of the clients employees  assume the risks and rewards of workers compensation insurance  and provide more sophisticated health care offerings to peo clients 
the peo product is available primarily for clients domiciled in florida and georgia  where the utilization of peos is more prevalent than other areas of the united states us 
due to the characteristics of the peo product  the revenue and profits from this product can fluctuate significantly between quarters 
these fluctuations primarily relate to the assumption of the risks and rewards of workers compensation insurance and  to a lesser extent  the other offerings unique to the peo product 
the risks and rewards of workers compensation insurance are derived from actuarial changes in estimated losses under workers compensation policies as the result of actual claims experience under our workers compensation policies and changes in workers compensation legislation by the state of florida 
revenue from other human resource services increased for fiscal and for fiscal to million and million  respectively 
this was the result of increases in revenue from time and attendance solutions  state unemployment services  and employee handbooks 
other human resource services revenue growth in fiscal compared to fiscal also reflected the benefit of revenue from the april acquisition of stromberg time and attendance solutions 
the increase in interest on funds held for clients in fiscal compared to fiscal is the result of higher average interest rates earned in fiscal and higher average portfolio balances 
the increase in interest on funds held for clients in fiscal compared to fiscal is the result of higher average interest rates earned in fiscal and higher average portfolio balances  offset by lower net realized gains on the sales of available for sale securities 
the higher average portfolio balances in both fiscal and fiscal were driven by client base growth  wage inflation  check volume growth within our current client base  and increased utilization of our payroll tax administration services and employee payment services

during fiscal  total expenses were affected by a strong sales year as our sales force exceeded its targets resulting in higher than normal levels of sales expense  continued investments in new products and services  geographic expansion within germany  and other expenditures to continually improve client service 
fiscal growth was impacted by additional expenses as a result of our april acquisition of stromberg 
at may   we had approximately  employees compared with approximately  at may  and  at may  depreciation expense is primarily related to buildings  furniture and fixtures  data processing equipment  and software 
depreciation expense increased in fiscal compared to fiscal due to the purchase in may of a  square foot building in rochester  new york and higher levels of capital expenditures 
amortization of intangible assets is primarily related to client lists obtained from previous acquisitions  which are amortized using accelerated methods 
other expenses include items such as delivery  forms and supplies  communications  travel and entertainment  professional services  and other costs incurred to support our business 
operating income operating income year over year growth was for fiscal and for fiscal the increases in operating income in fiscal and fiscal are attributable to the factors previously discussed 
investment income  net investment income  net primarily represents earnings from our cash and cash equivalents and investments in available for sale securities 
investment income does not include interest on funds held for clients  which is included in total revenue 
the increase in investment income in fiscal compared with fiscal is mainly due to higher average interest rates earned in fiscal and higher average portfolio balances resulting from investment of cash generated from ongoing operations 
the decrease in investment income in fiscal compared with fiscal is mainly due to lower net realized gains on sales of available for sale securities and lower average interest rates earned on longer term investments  offset by an increase in average daily balances 
income taxes our effective income tax rate was in fiscal  compared with in fiscal  and in fiscal the decrease in our effective income tax rate in fiscal was primarily the result of higher levels of tax exempt income  which is derived primarily from municipal debt securities in the funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios and a lower effective state income tax rate

commitments and contractual obligations we have unused borrowing capacity available under four uncommitted  secured  short term lines of credit with financial institutions at market rates of interest as follows financial institution amount available expiration date jp morgan chase bank  na million february fleet national bank  a bank of america company million february pnc bank  national association million february wells fargo bank  national association million february our credit facilities are evidenced by promissory notes and are secured by separate pledge security agreements by and between paychex  inc and each of the financial institutions the lenders  pursuant to which we have granted each of the lenders a security interest in certain of our investment securities accounts 
the collateral is maintained in a pooled custody account pursuant to the terms of a control agreement and is to be administered under an intercreditor agreement among the lenders 
under certain circumstances  individual lenders may require that collateral be transferred from the pooled account into segregated accounts for the benefit of such individual lenders 
the primary uses of the lines of credit would be to meet short term funding requirements related to deposit account overdrafts and client fund deposit obligations arising from electronic payment transactions on behalf of our clients in the ordinary course of business  if necessary 
no amounts were outstanding against these lines of credit during fiscal or at may  we had standby letters of credit outstanding totaling million at may   required to secure commitments for certain of our insurance policies 
these letters of credit expire at various dates between july and december and are secured by securities held in our corporate investment portfolios  including a million letter of credit for which funds have been segregated into a separate account

amounts actually paid under certain of these arrangements may be higher due to variable components of these agreements 
the obligations shown as other liabilities represent business acquisition reserves and are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets at may   with million in other current liabilities and million in other long term liabilities 
certain deferred compensation plan obligations and other long term liabilities amounting to million are excluded because the timing of actual payments cannot be specifically or reasonably determined due to the variability in assumptions required to project the timing of future payments 
advantage has license agreements with fifteen independently owned associate offices associates  which are responsible for selling and marketing advantage payroll services and performing certain operational functions  while paychex  inc and advantage provide all centralized back office payroll processing and payroll tax administration services 
in addition  advantage has a relationship with new england business services  inc nebs whereby advantage performs all client functions other than sales and marketing 
under these arrangements  advantage pays the associates and nebs commissions based on processing activity for the related clients 
since the actual amounts of future payments are uncertain  obligations under these arrangements are not included in the table above 
commission expense for the associates and nebs in fiscal and fiscal was million and million  respectively

future dividends are dependent on our future earnings and cash flow and are subject to the discretion of our board of directors 
proceeds from exercise of stock options the increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options in fiscal compared with fiscal is primarily due to an increase in the number of stock options exercised and an increase in the average exercise price per share 
the decrease in proceeds from the exercise of stock options in fiscal compared with fiscal is primarily due to a decrease in the number of stock options exercised

 accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
apb  accounting for stock issued to employees 
this statement requires that all stock based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  be recognized as compensation costs in the financial statements based on their fair values measured at the date of grant 
prior to june   we had accounted for grants of employee stock options under the intrinsic value method allowed under apb and related interpretations  and therefore had not recognized any compensation costs for stock based awards 
as permitted by sfas no 
 we presented pro forma financial results including the effects of share based compensation costs in the footnotes to the financial statements 
refer to note a to the consolidated financial statements  included in item of this form k  under the heading stock based compensation costs  for the pro forma results for fiscal   and 
table of contents sfas no 
r is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and permits adoption using one of the following two methods modified prospective method  in which compensation costs will be recognized in our consolidated financial statements for all awards granted after the date of adoption as well as for the unvested portion of existing awards as of the date of adoption the existing awards  and requires that prior periods not be restated 
modified retrospective method  which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above for new awards and existing awards  but also permits entities to restate prior periods based on amounts previously determined under sfas no 
for pro forma disclosures 
we will adopt this standard beginning june   using the modified prospective method 
accordingly  the results of operations for future periods will not be comparable to our historical results of operations 
we anticipate the adoption of sfas no 
r will negatively impact net income in the range of to in fiscal  increasing our operating expenses and selling  general and administrative expenses 
unrecognized stock based compensation costs related to existing awards as of may  were approximately million and are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
we cannot yet estimate what the compensation cost impact will be on our consolidated financial statements for the awards that we issue after june   as it will depend on the terms of any future grants approved by the board of directors and the underlying assumptions used in calculating the fair value at the time of any such future grants 
the calculation of fair value is very sensitive to changes in the underlying assumptions  especially volatility and expected option term life 
in addition  sfas no 
r will impact how income taxes are recorded to our consolidated financial statements  as tax deductions for certain tax qualified option grants incentive stock options are allowed only at the time a taxable disposition occurs 
this may result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the early periods after adoption and it could cause variability in our effective tax rate throughout a fiscal year as these events occur 
sfas no 
r also amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows  to require that excess tax benefits be reported as a financing cash inflow rather than a reduction of taxes paid in operating cash flows 
we cannot estimate what the amount of excess tax deductions will be in future periods 
however  the amounts of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for excess tax deductions were million  million  and million for fiscal   and  respectively 
our pro forma disclosures under sfas no 
utilized a black scholes option pricing model for valuing employee stock options and allocated the expense using an accelerated method 
upon adoption of sfas no 
r  we will continue to use a black scholes option pricing model  but will begin to allocate the expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period as we believe this better aligns the cost with the employee services provided 
upon adoption of sfas no 
r  we will be required to estimate forfeitures and only record compensation costs for those awards that are expected to vest 
in our pro forma disclosures under sfas no 
 we have accounted for forfeitures as they occurred 
our assumptions for forfeitures will be determined based on factors including type of award and historical experience  and will be reevaluated regularly as an award vests 
we currently offer an employee stock purchase plan to all employees  under which stock can be purchased through a payroll deduction with no discount to the market price and no look back provision 
we have determined that this plan is non compensatory and is not subject to the provisions of sfas no 
r 
therefore  no compensation costs will be recognized related to this plan

in october  the fasb issued fsp fas  accounting for rental costs incurred during a construction period 
this fsp provides that rental costs associated with operating leases that are incurred during a construction period should be recognized as rental expense and included in income from continuing operations 
the guidance in this fsp was effective in the first reporting period beginning after december  we have historically expensed rental costs incurred during a construction period  and therefore  the adoption of this fsp did not have an impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in november  the fasb issued fsp fas and fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
this fsp provides guidance on determining if an investment is considered to be impaired  if the impairment is other than temporary  and the measurement of an impairment loss 
it also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other than temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other than temporary impairments 
the guidance in this fsp amends sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities and was effective for reporting periods beginning after december  we account for investments in accordance with this guidance  and therefore  the adoption of this fsp did not have an impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in february and march  the fasb issued the following statements amending sfas no

sfas no 
 accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments an amendment of fasb statements no 
and  and sfas no 
 accounting for servicing of financial assets an amendment of fasb statement no 
the guidance in these statements is effective in the first fiscal year beginning after september  we do not utilize derivative financial instruments and currently do not have any servicing assets or servicing liabilities that would fall under the guidance of either statement  and therefore  the adoption of these statements will not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
critical accounting policies note a to the consolidated financial statements  included in item of this form k  discusses the significant accounting policies of paychex  inc our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates  judgments  and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience  future expectations  
table of contents and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances 
actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates 
certain accounting policies that are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below 
revenue recognition service revenue is recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
certain processing services are provided under annual service arrangements with revenue recognized ratably over the annual service period 
our service revenue is largely attributable to payroll related processing services where the fee is based on a fixed amount per processing period or a fixed amount per processing period plus a fee per employee or transaction processed 
the revenue earned on delivery service for the distribution of certain client payroll checks and reports is included in service revenue  and the costs for delivery are included in operating expenses on the consolidated statements of income 
peo revenue is included in service revenue and is reported net of direct costs billed and incurred  which include wages  taxes  benefit premiums  and claims of peo worksite employees 
direct costs billed and incurred for peo worksite employees were  million   million  and  million for fiscal   and  respectively 
revenue from certain time and attendance solutions is recognized using the residual method when all of the following are present persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  typically a non cancelable sales order  delivery is complete for the software and hardware  the fee is fixed or determinable and free of contingencies  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
maintenance contracts are generally purchased by our clients in conjunction with their purchase of certain time and attendance solutions 
revenue from these maintenance contracts is recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
interest on funds held for clients is earned primarily on funds that are collected from clients before due dates for payroll tax administration services and for employee payment services  and invested until remittance to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies or client employees 
these collections from clients are typically remitted between one and thirty days after receipt  with some items extending to ninety days 
the interest earned on these funds is included in total revenue on the consolidated statements of income because the collection  holding  and remittance of these funds are critical components of providing these services 
interest on funds held for clients also includes net realized gains and losses from the sales of available for sale securities 
peo workers compensation insurance workers compensation insurance reserves are established to provide for the estimated costs of paying claims underwritten by us 
these reserves include estimates for reported losses  plus amounts for those claims incurred but not reported and estimates of certain expenses associated with processing and settling the claims 
in establishing the workers compensation insurance reserves  we utilize an independent actuarial estimate of undiscounted future cash payments that would be made to settle the claims 
estimating the ultimate cost of future claims is an uncertain and complex process based upon historical loss experience and actuarial loss projections  and is subject to change due to multiple factors  including social and economic trends  changes in legal liability law  and damage awards  all of which could materially impact the reserves as reported in the consolidated financial statements 
accordingly  final claim settlements may vary from our present estimates  particularly when those payments may not occur until well into the future 
we regularly review the adequacy of our estimated workers compensation insurance reserves 
adjustments to previously established reserves are reflected in the operating results of the period in which the adjustment is identified 
such adjustments could possibly be significant  reflecting any variety of new and adverse or favorable trends 
in fiscal and fiscal  workers compensation insurance for peo worksite employees was provided based on claims paid as incurred 
our maximum individual claims liability was  under the fiscal policy and  under the fiscal policy 

table of contents we had recorded the following amounts on our consolidated balance sheets for workers compensation claims as of may prepaid current long term in thousands expense liability liability valuation of investments our investments in available for sale securities are reported at market value 
unrealized gains related to increases in the market value of investments and unrealized losses related to decreases in the market value are included in comprehensive income  net of tax  as reported on our consolidated statements of stockholders equity 
however  changes in the market value of investments impact our net income only when such investments are sold or impairment is recognized 
realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of the security s cost basis 
on our consolidated statements of income  realized gains and losses from funds held for clients are included in interest on funds held for clients  whereas realized gains and losses from corporate investments are included in investment income  net 
we are exposed to credit risk in connection with our available for sale securities from the possible inability of borrowers to meet the terms of their bonds 
we attempt to mitigate this risk by investing primarily in high credit quality securities  aaa and aa rated securities  and a rated short term securities 
we periodically review our investment portfolio to determine if any investment is other than temporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns  which would require us to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made 
in making this judgment  we evaluate  among other things  the duration and extent to which the market value of an investment is less than its cost  the credit rating and any changes in credit rating for the investment  and our ability and intent to hold the investment until the earlier of market price recovery or maturity 
our assessment that an investment is not other than temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumption related to any particular investment 
goodwill and intangible assets for business combinations  we assign estimated fair values to all assets and liabilities acquired  including intangible assets  such as customer lists  certain license agreements  trade names  and non compete agreements 
the assignment of fair values to acquired assets and liabilities and the determination of useful lives for depreciable and amortizable assets requires significant estimates  judgments  and assumptions 
for certain fixed assets  including software and intangible assets  we utilize the assistance of independent valuation consultants 
the remaining purchase price of the acquired business not assigned to identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill 
we have million of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at may   resulting from acquisitions in fiscal and fiscal sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires that goodwill not be amortized  but instead tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change in a way to indicate that there has been a potential decline in the fair value of the reporting unit 
impairment is determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
we perform our annual review at the beginning of the fourth fiscal quarter 
our business is largely homogeneous and  as a result  substantially all of the goodwill is associated with one reporting unit 
based on the results of our goodwill impairment review  no impairment loss was recognized in the results of operations for fiscal or fiscal subsequent to this review  there have been no events or circumstances that indicate any potential impairment of our goodwill balance 
we also test intangible assets for potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
accrual for client fund losses we maintain an accrual for estimated losses associated with our clients inability to meet their payroll obligations 
as part of providing payroll  payroll tax administration services  and employee payment services  we are authorized by the client to initiate money transfers from the client s 
table of contents account for the amount of tax obligations and employees direct deposits 
electronic money fund transfers from client bank accounts are subject to potential risk of loss resulting from clients insufficient funds to cover such transfers 
we evaluate certain uncollected amounts on a specific basis and analyze historical experience for amounts not specifically reviewed to determine the likelihood of recovery from the clients 
contingent liabilities we are subject to various claims and legal matters that arise in the normal course of business 
at may   we had approximately million of reserves for pending legal matters 
based on the application of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  which requires us to record a reserve if we believe an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the probable loss can be reasonably estimated  we deem this amount adequate 
the determination of whether any particular matter involves a probable loss or if the amount of a probable loss can be reasonably estimated requires considerable judgment 
this reserve may change in the future due to new developments or changes in our strategies or assumptions related to any particular matter 
in light of the legal reserve recorded  we currently believe that resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
however  these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and there exists the possibility that the ultimate resolution of these matters could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and our results of operations in the period in which any such effect is recorded 
for additional information regarding pending legal matters  refer to note l in the notes to consolidated financial statements  contained in item of this form k 
income taxes we account for deferred taxes by recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in our financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we account for the tax benefit from the exercise of non qualified stock options by reducing our accrued income tax liability and increasing additional paid in capital 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk factors changes in interest rates and interest rate risk funds held for clients are primarily comprised of short term funds and available for sale securities and corporate investments are primarily comprised of available for sale securities 
as a result of our operating and investing activities  we are exposed to changes in interest rates that may materially affect our results of operations and financial position 
changes in interest rates will impact the earnings potential of future investments and will cause fluctuations in the market value of our longer term available for sale securities 
in seeking to minimize the risks and or costs associated with such activities  we generally direct investments towards high credit quality  fixed rate municipal and government securities and manage the available for sale securities to a benchmark duration of two and one half to three years 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk 
our investment portfolios and the earnings from these portfolios have been impacted by the fluctuations in interest rates 
the federal funds rate has increased to as of may  during fiscal  the average interest rate earned on our combined funds held for clients and corporate investment portfolios was compared with for fiscal and for fiscal short term rates rose steadily throughout fiscal and fiscal in fiscal  longer term rates  on average  were basically unchanged from fiscal  but have risen steadily in fiscal while short term and long term interest rates generally move in the same direction  there are certain economic and liquidity conditions that will affect this relationship 
while interest rates are rising  the full benefit of higher interest rates will not immediately be reflected in net income due to the interaction of long and short term interest rate changes as discussed below 
the federal funds rate decreased from at may  to at may  the decreasing interest rate environment experienced through fiscal negatively affected net income growth 
during fiscal  the decreasing rate environment generated significant unrealized gains for our longer term available for sale securities and we were able to mitigate some of the impact of lower interest rates on earnings by realizing gains from sales of our investments 

table of contents increases in interest rates increase earnings from our short term investments  and over time will increase earnings from our longer term available for sale securities 
earnings from the available for sale securities  which currently have an average duration of years excluding the impact of auction rate securities and vrdns that are tied to short term interest rates  will not reflect increases in interest rates until the investments are sold or mature and the proceeds are reinvested at higher rates 
an increasing interest rate environment will generally result in a decrease in the market value of our investment portfolio 
the cost and market value of available for sale securities that have stated maturities at may  are shown below by contractual maturity 
expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to prepay obligations without prepayment penalties 
may  in thousands cost market value maturity date due in one year or less due after one year through three years due after three years through five years due after five years total available for sale securities vrdns and auction rate securities are primarily categorized as due after five years in the table above as the contractual maturities on these securities is typically twenty to thirty years 
although these securities are issued as long term securities  both are priced and traded as short term instruments because of the liquidity provided through the auction or tender feature 
the following table summarizes the changes in the federal funds rate over the past three fiscal years federal funds rate beginning of fiscal year rate increase decrease first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter federal funds rate end of fiscal year three year aaa municipal securities yields end of fiscal year the federal funds rate was increased to on june  calculating the future effects of changing interest rates involves many factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to  daily interest rate changes  seasonal variations in investment balances  actual duration of short term and available for sale securities  the proportional mix of taxable and tax exempt investments  and changes in tax exempt municipal rates versus taxable investment rates  which are not synchronized or simultaneous 
subject to these factors  a basis point change in taxable interest rates generally affects our tax exempt interest rates by approximately basis points 
our total investment portfolio funds held for clients and corporate investments averaged approximately billion for the full year ended may  our normal and anticipated allocation is approximately invested in short term securities and available for sale securities that are priced and traded as short term securities auction rate securities and vrdns with an average duration of thirty five days  and invested in other available for sale securities with an average duration of two and one half to three years 
based on these current assumptions  we estimate that the earnings effect of a basis point change in interest rates 
table of contents basis points for tax exempt investments at the beginning of fiscal would be approximately million to million for fiscal the combined funds held for clients and corporate available for sale securities reflected a net unrealized loss of million at may   compared with a net unrealized loss of million at may   and a net unrealized loss of million at may  during fiscal  the net unrealized gain or loss position ranged from a net unrealized loss of million to million 
during fiscal  the net unrealized gain or loss position ranged from approximately million net unrealized loss to million net unrealized gain 
the net unrealized loss position of our investment portfolios was approximately million at july  as of may  and may   we had billion and billion  respectively  invested in available for sale securities at market value 
excluding auction rate securities and vrdns classified as available for sale securities which are tied to short term interest rates  the weighted average yields to maturity were and  as of may  and may   respectively 
assuming a hypothetical increase in both short term and longer term interest rates of basis points  the resulting potential decrease in market value for our portfolio of securities at may   would be approximately million 
conversely  a corresponding decrease in interest rates would result in a comparable increase in market value 
this hypothetical decrease or increase in the market value of the portfolio would be recorded as an adjustment to the portfolio s recorded value  with an offsetting amount recorded in stockholders equity and with no related or immediate impact on the results of operations 
credit risk we are exposed to credit risk in connection with these investments through the possible inability of the borrowers to meet the terms of the bonds 
we attempt to limit credit risk by investing primarily in aaa and aa rated securities and a rated short term securities  and by limiting amounts that can be invested in any single issuer
