table of contents critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to our valuation of inventory  allowance for uncollectable accounts receivable  allowance for sales returns  long lived assets and deferred income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
historically  however  actual results have not differed materially from those determined using required estimates 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in the notes accompanying the financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
however  the company considers the following accounting policies to be more significantly dependent on the use of estimates and assumptions 
stock based compensation the company accounts for stock based compensation whereby share based payment transactions with employees  such as stock options and restricted stock  are measured at estimated fair value at date of grant and recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period 
revenue recognition sales are recognized and recorded when products are shipped 
products are shipped fob shipping point 
the ubah division s sales are paid before the product is shipped 
these sales accounted for of net revenues in fy  in fy and in fy the provisions of the sec staff accounting bulletin no  revenue recognition in financial statements  have been applied  and as a result  a reserve is provided for estimated future sales returns 
the company s sales return policy allows the customer to return all purchases for an exchange or refund for up to days after the customer receives the item 
estimated allowances for sales returns are recorded as sales are recognized and recorded 
management uses a moving average calculation to estimate the allowance for sales returns 
the company is not responsible for product damaged in transit 
damaged returns are primarily from the retail stores 
the damages occur in the stores  not in shipping to the stores 
it is industry practice to accept returns from wholesale customers 
transportation revenue  the amount billed to the customer for shipping the product  is recorded when products are shipped 
management has estimated and included a reserve for sales returns of  as of february  and  as of february  allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
an estimate of uncollectable amounts is made by management based upon historical bad debts  current customer receivable balances  age of customer receivable balances  the customer s financial condition and current economic trends 
if the actual uncollected amounts significantly exceed the estimated allowance  then the company s operating results would be significantly adversely affected 
management has estimated allowance for doubtful accounts of  and  as of february  and february   respectively 

table of contents inventory management continually estimates and calculates the amount of non current inventory 
the inventory arises due to the company occasionally purchasing book inventory in quantities in excess of what will be sold within the normal operating cycle due to minimum order requirements of the company s primary supplier 
noncurrent inventory was estimated by management using the current year turnover ratio by title 
all inventory in excess of years of anticipated sales was classified as noncurrent inventory 
noncurrent inventory balances were  and  at february  and february   respectively 
inventories are presented net of a valuation allowance 
management has estimated and included a valuation allowance for both current and noncurrent inventory 
this allowance is based on management s identification of slow moving inventory on hand 
management has estimated a valuation allowance for both current and noncurrent inventory of  and  as of february  and  respectively 
the company s product line contains approximately  titles  each with different rates of sale  depending upon the popularity of the various titles 
almost all of the company s product line is saleable as the books are not topical in nature and remain current in content today as well as in the future 
a few of the titles  less than  have a limited time when they remain current in content  ie computer books  and these few titles are fully reserved as warranted 
the company s products are printed in europe  china and the middle east  resulting in a six month lead time to have a title reprinted and delivered to the company 
the company s principal supplier  based in england  imposes minimum order requirements before reprinting a title 
at the current time the company must reorder  or more of a title in order to get a solo print run 
if the company orders less than  of a title  then it must share a print run with the suppliers other customers 
sharing a print run has resulted in delays of up to twelve months in the company receiving the ordered title 
anticipating customer preferences and purchasing habits requires historical analysis of similar titles in the same series 
the company then places the initial order or re order based upon this analysis 
these factors and historical analysis have led management to determine that years represents a reasonable estimate of the normal operating cycle for the company s products 
deferred tax assets as discussed in note of the consolidated financial statements  the company does not currently have a valuation allowance recorded against its deferred tax assets 
if management determines it is more likely than not that its deferred tax assets would not be realizable in the future  a valuation allowance would be recorded to reduce the deferred tax asset to its net realizable value 
long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of our property and equipment may not be recoverable from future operating cash flows  we will perform a test to determine if the asset values are impaired 
we believe that at this time that such an evaluation is not necessary
