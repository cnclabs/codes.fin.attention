item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the heading operating segments and geographic information of this annual report on form k 
item a 
risk factors 
there are many important factors that have affected  and in the future could affect our business  including the factors discussed below which should be reviewed carefully  in conjunction with the other information contained in this form k 
some of these factors are beyond our control and future trends are difficult to predict 
in addition  various statements  discussions and analyses throughout this form k are not based on historical fact and contain forward looking statements 
these statements are also subject to certain risks and uncertainties  including those discussed below  which could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward looking statements made by us 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward looking statement contained in this form k and should also be aware that we undertake no obligation to update any forward looking information contained herein to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this form k or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
the loss or reduction in orders from principal customers or a reduction in prices we are able to charge these customers could materially adversely affect our business 
in  and computech overseas international computech  a customer of the company s brightpoint asia limited operations  accounted for approximately  and of the company s total revenue and  and of the asia pacific division s revenue 
at december  and  there were no amounts owed to us from computech 
although nextel communications  inc nextel  a fee based logistic services customer  is less than of the company s total revenue  it is more than of wireless devices handled in our business in the united states 
sprint corporation sprint is a customer and a supplier within the activation services business in the company s north american business 
on august   sprint and nextel completed a merger to form sprint nextel corporation sprint nextel 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in retaining this customer 
many of our customers in the markets we serve have experienced severe price competition and for this and other reasons may seek to obtain products or services from us at lower prices than we have been able to provide these customers in the past 
the loss of any of our principal customers  a reduction in the amount of product or services our principal customers order from us or the inability to maintain current terms  including price  with these or other customers could have an adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
although we have entered into contracts with certain of our largest logistic services customers  we previously have experienced losses of certain of these customers through expiration or cancellation of our contracts with them and there can be no assurance that any of our customers will continue to purchase products or services from us or that their purchases will be at the same or greater levels than in prior periods 
our business may be adversely impacted by consolidation of mobile operators 
the past several years have witnessed a consolidation within the mobile operator community  and this trend is expected to continue 
this trend could result in a reduction or elimination of promotional activities by the remaining mobile operators as they seek to reduce their expenditures  which could in turn  result in decreased demand for our products or services 
moreover  consolidation of mobile operators reduces the number of potential contracts available to us and other providers of logistic services 
we could also lose business if mobile operators  which are our customers  are acquired by other mobile operators that are not our customers 

table of contents we buy a significant amount of our products from a limited number of suppliers  who may not provide us with competitive products at reasonable prices when we need them in the future 
we purchase wireless devices and accessories that we sell from wireless communications equipment manufacturers  distributors and network operators 
we depend on these suppliers to provide us with adequate inventories of currently popular brand name products on a timely basis and on favorable pricing and other terms 
our agreements with our suppliers are generally non exclusive  require us to satisfy minimum purchase requirements  can be terminated on short notice and provide for certain territorial restrictions  as is common in our industry 
we generally purchase products pursuant to purchase orders placed from time to time in the ordinary course of business 
in the future  our suppliers may not offer us competitive products on favorable terms without delays 
from time to time we have been unable to obtain sufficient product supplies from manufacturers in many markets in which we operate 
any future failure or delay by our suppliers in supplying us with products on favorable terms would severely diminish our ability to obtain and deliver products to our customers on a timely and competitive basis 
if we lose any of our principal suppliers  or if these suppliers are unable to fulfill our product needs  or if any principal supplier imposes substantial price increases and alternative sources of supply are not readily available  this may result in a loss of customers and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we may become subject to suits alleging medical risks associated with our wireless devices 
lawsuits or claims have been filed or made against manufacturers of wireless devices over the past years alleging possible medical risks  including brain cancer  associated with the electromagnetic fields emitted by wireless communications devices 
there has been only limited relevant research in this area  and this research has not been conclusive as to what effects  if any  exposure to electromagnetic fields emitted by wireless devices has on human cells 
substantially all of our revenues are derived  either directly or indirectly  from sales of wireless devices 
we may become subject to lawsuits filed by plaintiffs alleging various health risks from our products 
if any future studies find possible health risks associated with the use of wireless devices or if any damages claim against us is successful  it could have a material adverse effect on our business 
even an unsubstantiated perception that health risks exist could adversely affect our ability or the ability of our customers to market wireless devices 
we may have difficulty collecting our accounts receivable 
we currently offer and intend to offer open account terms to certain of our customers  which may subject us to credit risks  particularly in the event that any receivables represent sales to a limited number of customers or are concentrated in particular geographic markets 
the collection of our accounts receivable and our ability to accelerate our collection cycle through the sale of accounts receivable is affected by several factors  including  but not limited to  our credit granting policies  contractual provisions  our customers and our overall credit rating as determined by various credit rating agencies  industry and economic conditions  the ability of the customer to provide security  collateral or guarantees relative to credit granted by us  the customer s and our recent operating results  financial position and cash flows and our ability to obtain credit insurance on amounts that we are owed 
adverse changes in any of these factors  certain of which may not be wholly in our control  could create delays in collecting or an inability to collect our accounts receivable which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  cash flows and results of operations 
our future operating results will depend on our ability to continue to increase volumes and maintain margins 
a large percentage of our total revenues is derived from sales of wireless devices  a part of our business that operates on a high volume  low margin basis 
our ability to generate these sales is based upon demand for wireless voice and data products and our having adequate supply of these products 
the gross margins that we realize on sales of wireless devices could be reduced due to increased competition or a growing industry emphasis on cost containment 
however  a sales mix shift to fee based logistic services may place negative pressure on our revenue growth while having a positive impact on our gross margins 
therefore  our future profitability will depend on our ability to maintain our margins or to increase our sales to help offset future declines in margins 
we may not be able to maintain existing margins for products or services offered by us or increase our sales 
even if our sales rates do increase  the gross margins that we receive from our sales may not be sufficient to make our future operations profitable 
our business growth strategy includes acquisitions 
we have acquired other businesses in the past and plan to continue to do so in the future based on our global business strategy 
acquisitions may not meet our expectations at the time of purchase and could adversely affect our operations causing operating losses and subsequent write downs due to asset impairments 
the market price of our common stock may continue to be volatile 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly from time to time since our initial public offering in april the trading price of our common stock could experience significant fluctuations in the future in response to certain factors  which could include actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results or financial position  repurchases of common stock  commencement of litigation  the introduction of new services  products or technologies by us  our suppliers or our competitors  changes in other conditions or trends in the wireless voice and data industry  changes in governmental regulation and the enforcement of 
table of contents such regulation  changes in the assessment of our credit rating as determined by various credit rating agencies  or changes in securities analysts estimates of our future performance or that of our competitors or our industry in general 
general market price declines or market volatility in the prices of stock for companies in the global wireless industry or in the distribution or logistic services sectors of the global wireless industry could also affect the market price of our common stock 
our business depends on the continued tendency of wireless equipment manufacturers and network operators to outsource aspects of their business to us in the future 
we provide functions such as distribution  inventory management  fulfillment  customized packaging  prepaid and e commerce solutions  activation management and other outsourced services for many wireless manufacturers and network operators 
certain wireless equipment manufacturers and network operators have elected  and others may elect  to undertake these services internally 
additionally  our customer service levels  industry consolidation  competition  deregulation  technological changes or other developments could reduce the degree to which members of the global wireless industry rely on outsourced logistic services such as the services we provide 
any significant change in the market for our outsourced services could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our outsourced services are generally provided under multi year renewable contractual arrangements 
service periods under certain of our contractual arrangements are expiring or will expire in the near future 
the failure to obtain renewals or otherwise maintain these agreements on terms  including price  consistent with our current terms could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we depend on third parties to manufacture products that we distribute and  accordingly  rely on their quality control procedures 
product manufacturers typically provide limited warranties directly to the end consumer or to us  which we generally pass through to our customers 
if a product we distribute for a manufacturer has quality or performance problems  our ability to provide products to our customers could be disrupted 
our operations may be materially affected by fluctuations in regional demand patterns and economic factors 
the demand for our products and services has fluctuated and may continue to vary substantially within the regions served by us 
we believe that the enhanced functionality of wireless devices and the roll out of next generation systems has had and will continue to have an effect on overall subscriber growth and handset replacement demand 
economic slow downs in regions served by us or changes in promotional programs offered by mobile operators may lower consumer demand and create higher levels of inventories in our distribution channels which results in lower than anticipated demand for the products and services that we offer and can decrease our gross and operating margins 
a prolonged economic slow down in the united states or any other region in which we have significant operations could negatively impact our results of operations and financial position 
rapid technological changes in the global wireless industry could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the technology relating to wireless voice and data equipment changes rapidly resulting in product obsolescence or short product life cycles 
we are required to anticipate future technological changes in our industry and to continually identify  obtain and market new products in order to satisfy evolving industry and customer requirements 
competitors or manufacturers of wireless equipment may market products or services which have perceived or actual advantages over our service offerings or products that we handle or which otherwise render those products or services obsolete or less marketable 
we have made and continue to make significant capital investments in accordance with evolving industry and customer requirements including maintaining levels of inventories of currently popular products that we believe are necessary based on current market conditions 
these concentrations of capital increase our risk of loss due to product obsolescence 
we rely on our suppliers to provide trade credit facilities to adequately fund our on going operations and product purchases 
our business is dependent on our ability to obtain adequate supplies of currently popular product at favorable pricing and on other favorable terms 
our ability to fund our product purchases is dependent on our principal suppliers providing favorable payment terms that allow us to maximize the efficiency of our capital usage 
the payment terms we receive from our suppliers is dependent on several factors  including  but not limited to  pledged cash requirements  our payment history with the supplier  the supplier s credit granting policies  contractual provisions  our overall credit rating as determined by various credit rating agencies  industry conditions  our recent operating results  financial position and cash flows and the supplier s ability to obtain credit insurance on amounts that we owe them 
adverse changes in any of these factors  certain of which may not be wholly in our control  could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
a significant percentage of our revenues are generated outside of the united states in countries that may have volatile currencies or other risks 
we maintain operations centers and sales offices in territories and countries outside of the united states 
the fact that our business operations are conducted in a wide variety of countries exposes us to increased credit risks  customs duties  import quotas and other trade restrictions  potentially greater inflationary pressures  shipping 
table of contents delays  the risk of failure or material interruption of wireless systems and services  possible wireless product supply interruption and potentially significant increases in wireless product prices 
changes may occur in social  political  regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade and investment in the territories and countries where we currently have operations 
us laws and regulations relating to investment and trade in foreign countries could also change to our detriment 
any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations 
we purchase and sell products and services in a number of foreign currencies  many of which have experienced fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
in the past  we entered into forward exchange swaps  futures or options contracts as a means of hedging our currency transaction and balance sheet translation exposures 
however  our management has had limited prior experience in engaging in these types of transactions 
even if done well  hedging may not effectively limit our exposure to a decline in operating results due to foreign currency translation 
we cannot predict the effect that future exchange rate fluctuations will have on our operating results 
we have ceased operations or divested several of our foreign operations because they were not performing to acceptable levels 
these actions resulted in significant losses to us 
we may in the future  decide to divest certain existing foreign operations 
this could result in our incurring significant additional losses 
natural disasters  epidemics  hostilities and terrorist acts could disrupt our operations 
although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to minimize the effect of a natural disaster  epidemics  outbreak of hostilities or terrorist attacks in markets served by us or on our facilities  the actual effect of any such events on our operations cannot be determined at this time but our operations could be adversely affected 
we make significant investments in the technology used in our business and rely on that technology to function effectively without interruptions 
we have made significant investments in information systems technology and have focused on the application of this technology to provide customized logistic services to wireless communications equipment manufacturers and network operators 
our ability to meet our customers technical and performance requirements is highly dependent on the effective functioning of our information technology systems 
further  certain of our contractual arrangements to provide services contain performance measures and criteria that if not met could result in early termination of the agreement and claims for damages 
in connection with the implementation of this technology we have incurred significant costs and have experienced significant business interruptions 
business interruptions can cause us to fall below acceptable performance levels pursuant to our customers requirements and could result in the loss of the related business relationship 
we may experience additional costs and periodic business interruptions related to our information systems as we implement new information systems in our various operations 
our sales and marketing efforts  a large part of which are telemarketing based  are highly dependent on computer and telephone equipment 
we anticipate that we will need to continue to invest significant amounts to enhance our information systems in order to maintain our competitiveness and to develop new logistic services 
our property and business interruption insurance may not compensate us adequately  or at all  for losses that we may incur if we lose our equipment or systems either temporarily or permanently 
in addition  a significant increase in the costs of additional technology or telephone services that are not recoverable through an increase in the price of our services could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we have debt facilities  which are secured by a portion of our assets and which could prevent us from borrowing additional funds  if needed 
our united states  australia and new zealand subsidiaries credit facilities are secured by primarily all of their respective assets and borrowing availability is based primarily on a percentage of eligible accounts receivable and inventory 
consequently  any significant decrease in eligible accounts receivable and inventory could limit our subsidiaries ability to borrow additional funds to adequately finance our operations and expansion strategies 
the terms of our united states  australia and new zealand subsidiaries credit facilities also include negative covenants that  among other things  may limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness  sell certain assets and make certain payments  including but not limited to  dividends  repurchases of common stock and other payments outside the normal course of business as well as prohibiting us from merging or consolidating with another corporation or selling all or substantially all of our assets in the united states  australia and new zealand 
if we violate any of these loan covenants  default on these obligations or become subject to a change of control  our subsidiaries indebtedness would become immediately due and payable  and the banks could foreclose on its security 
the global wireless industry is intensely competitive and we may not be able to continue to compete successfully in this industry 
we compete for sales of wireless voice and data equipment  and expect that we will continue to compete  with numerous well established mobile operators  distributors and manufacturers  including our own suppliers 
as a provider of logistic services  we also compete with other distributors  logistic services companies and electronic manufacturing services companies 
many of our competitors possess greater financial and other resources than we do and may market similar products or services directly to our customers 
the global wireless industry has generally had low barriers to entry 
as a result  additional competitors may choose to enter our industry in the future 
the markets for wireless handsets and 
table of contents accessories are characterized by intense price competition and significant price erosion over the life of a product 
many of our competitors have the financial resources to withstand substantial price competition and to implement extensive advertising and promotional programs  both generally and in response to efforts by additional competitors to enter into new markets or introduce new products 
our ability to continue to compete successfully will depend largely on our ability to maintain our current industry relationships 
we may not be successful in anticipating and responding to competitive factors affecting our industry  including new or changing outsourcing requirements  the entry of additional well capitalized competitors  new products which may be introduced  changes in consumer preferences  demographic trends  international  national  regional and local economic conditions and competitors discount pricing and promotion strategies 
as wireless telecommunications markets mature and as we seek to enter into new markets and offer new products in the future  the competition that we face may change and grow more intense 
we may not be able to manage and sustain future growth at our historical or current rates 
in prior years we have experienced domestic and international growth 
we will need to manage our expanding operations effectively  maintain or accelerate our growth as planned and integrate any new businesses which we may acquire into our operations successfully in order to continue our desired growth 
if we are unable to do so  particularly in instances in which we have made significant capital investments  it could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
our ability to absorb  through revenue growth  the increasing operating costs that we have incurred and continue to incur in connection with our activities and the execution of our strategy could have a material adverse effect on future earnings 
in addition  our growth prospects could be adversely affected by a decline in the global wireless industry generally or in one of our regional divisions  either of which could result in reduction or deferral of expenditures by prospective customers 
our business strategy includes entering into relationships and financings  which may provide us with minimal returns or losses on our investments 
we have entered into several relationships with wireless equipment manufacturers  mobile operators and other participants in our industry 
for example  we have invested in our aws business  which may or may not provide us with acceptable returns 
we intend to continue to enter into similar relationships as opportunities arise 
we may enter into distribution or logistic services agreements with these parties and may provide them with equity or debt financing 
our ability to achieve future profitability through these relationships will depend in part upon the economic viability  success and motivation of the entities we select as partners and the amount of time and resources that these partners devote to our alliances 
we may receive minimal or no business from these relationships and joint ventures  and any business we receive may not be significant or at the level we anticipated 
the returns we receive from these relationships  if any  may not offset possible losses or our investments or the full amount of financings that we make upon entering into these relationships 
we may not achieve acceptable returns on our investments with these parties within an acceptable period or at all 
our operating results frequently vary significantly and respond to seasonal fluctuations in purchasing patterns 
the operating results of each of our three divisions may be influenced by a number of seasonal factors in the different countries and markets in which we operate 
these factors may cause our revenue and operating results to fluctuate on a quarterly basis 
these fluctuations are a result of several factors  including  but not limited to promotions and subsidies by mobile operators  the timing of local holidays and other events affecting consumer demand  the timing of the introduction of new products by our suppliers and competitors  purchasing patterns of customers in different markets  general economic conditions  and product availability and pricing 
consumer electronics and retail sales in many geographic markets tend to experience increased volumes of sales at the end of the calendar year  largely because of gift giving holidays 
this and other seasonal factors have contributed to increases in our sales during the fourth quarter in certain markets 
conversely  we have experienced decreases in demand in the first quarter subsequent to the higher level of activity in the preceding fourth quarter 
our operating results may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future 
if unanticipated events occur  including delays in securing adequate inventories of competitive products at times of peak sales or significant decreases in sales during these periods  it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
in addition  as a result of seasonal factors  interim results may not be indicative of annual results 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional analysis on seasonality 
we are subject to certain personnel related issues 
our success depends in large part on the abilities and continued service of our executive officers and other key employees 
although we have entered into employment agreements with several of our officers and employees  we may not be able to retain their services 
we also have non competition agreements with our executive officers and some of our existing key personnel 
however  courts are sometimes reluctant to enforce non competition agreements 
the loss of executive officers or other key personnel could have a material adverse effect on us 
in addition  in order to support our continued growth  we will be required to effectively recruit  develop and retain additional 
table of contents qualified management 
some labor markets are very competitive 
if we are unable to attract and retain additional necessary personnel  it could delay or hinder our plans for growth 
we are subject to a number of regulatory and contractual restrictions governing our relations with certain of our employees  including national collective labor agreements for certain of our employees who are employed outside of the united states and individual employer labor agreements 
these arrangements address a number of specific issues affecting our working conditions including hiring  work time  wages and benefits  and termination of employment 
we could be required to make significant payments in order to comply with these requirements 
the cost of complying with these requirements may materially adversely affect our business and financial condition 
our distribution activities and logistic services are labor intensive  and we experience high personnel turnover and can be adversely affected by shortages in the available labor force in geographical areas where we operate 
a significant portion of our labor force is contracted through temporary agencies and a significant portion of our costs consists of wages to hourly workers 
growth in our business  together with seasonal increases in net revenue  requires us to recruit and train personnel at an accelerated rate from time to time 
we may not be able to continue to hire  train and retain a significant labor force of qualified individuals when needed  or at all 
an increase in hourly costs  employee benefit costs  employment taxes or commission rates could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
in addition  if the turnover rate among our labor force increased further  we could be required to increase our recruiting and training efforts and costs  and our operating efficiencies and productivity could decrease 
we rely to a great extent on trade secret and copyright laws and agreements with our key employees and other third parties to protect our proprietary rights 
our business success is substantially dependent upon our proprietary business methods and software applications relating to our information systems 
we currently hold one patent relating to certain of our business methods 
concerning other business methods and software we rely on trade secret and copyright laws to protect our proprietary knowledge 
we also regularly enter into non disclosure agreements with our key employees and limit access to and distribution of our trade secrets and other proprietary information 
these measures may not prove adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology 
our competitors could also independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology  thereby eliminating one of our competitive advantages 
we also have offices and conduct our operations in a wide variety of countries outside the united states 
the laws of some other countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent  as do laws in the united states 
in addition  although we believe that our business methods and proprietary software have been developed independently and do not infringe upon the rights of others  third parties might assert infringement claims against us in the future or our business methods and software may be found to infringe upon the proprietary rights of others 
we have significant future payment obligations pursuant to certain leases and other long term contracts 
we lease our office and warehouse distribution facilities under real property and personal equipment leases 
many of these leases are for terms that exceed one year and require us to pay significant monetary charges for early termination or breach by us of the lease terms 
we cannot be certain of our ability to adequately fund these lease commitments from our future operations and our decision to modify  change or abandon any of our existing facilities could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
we may be unable to obtain and maintain adequate business insurance at a reasonable cost 
although we currently maintain general commercial  property liability and transportation insurance in amounts we believe are appropriate  it has become increasingly difficult in recent years to obtain adequate insurance coverage at a reasonable cost 
our operations could be adversely affected by a loss that is not covered by insurance due to our inability in the future to obtain adequate insurance 
moreover  increasing insurance premiums would adversely affect our future operating results 
there are amounts of our securities  which are issuable pursuant to our long term incentive plan  our amended and restated independent director stock compensation plan and our stock option plan  which  if issued  could result in dilution to existing shareholders  reduce earnings in future periods and adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
we have reserved a significant number of shares of common stock that may be issuable pursuant to these plans 
grants made under these plans could result in dilution to existing shareholders 
moreover  effective january   as required under recently issued accounting pronouncement statement of financial accounting standards sfas r  share based payment  the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions will be recognized in financial statements 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
this requirement will reduce earnings  earnings per share  net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 

table of contents we have instituted measures to protect us against a takeover 
certain provisions of our by laws  shareholders rights and option plans  certain employment agreements and the indiana business corporation law are designed to protect us in the event of a takeover attempt 
these provisions could prohibit or delay mergers or attempted takeovers or changes in control of us and  accordingly  may discourage attempts to acquire us

item legal proceedings 
the company is from time to time involved in certain legal proceedings in the ordinary course of conducting its business 
while the ultimate liability pursuant to these actions cannot currently be determined  the company believes these legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial statements as a whole

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
overview we measure our performance by focusing on certain key performance indicators such as the number of wireless devices handled  gross margin by service line  operating income  cash flow  cash conversion cycle  return on invested capital and liquidity 
our million wireless devices handled in was a record for us 
we continue to focus our attention on growing earnings while maintaining a strong balance sheet  which is evidenced by the million of cash provided by operating activities during we manage our business based on two distinct service lines which include product distribution and logistic services 
during  wireless devices sold through distribution grew by  and wireless devices handled through logistic services grew by 
while our distribution gross margin remained unchanged at  our logistic services gross margin increased by percentage points to 
we are focused on increasing the volume of wireless devices in total as opposed to increasing volume in one service line versus the other because both service lines provide a reasonable return in relation to the capital invested and the risk assumed

additionally  we acquired a significant new customer  cricket communications  a subsidiary of leap wireless international  inc  in  which contributed to our growth rate 
growth in our north america business was tempered by a decline in wireless devices handled in our distribution business 
this decline was significantly attributable to the transition of certain regional mobile operators from tdma to either gsm or cdma and we lost market share in this channel due to a key supplier s relatively weaker market position in gsm and cdma as compared to tdma 
we were able to fill a portion of the demand with alternative suppliers  however  not sufficiently enough to maintain our historical market share in this segment 
additionally  a certain mobile operator promoted wireless devices directly to its dealer channel at subsidized pricing that made our offering 
table of contents to our dealer channel for that same mobile operator s wireless devices uncompetitive 
the increase in our colombia business was ascribable to a successful conversion from tdma to gsm of our key logistics mobile operator customer  combined with promotional activity and with a general increase in demand in the colombia market 
the remainder of the increase in wireless devices handled was in the europe division  which experienced a increase 
this was principally due to our entries into the slovak republic and finland during demand was generally higher in our european markets and we were able to fill growing demand for high end wireless data devices

wireless devices handled by service line year ended december  of december  of total total change amounts in s distribution logistic services total the decrease in wireless devices handled through product distribution was primarily caused by a decline in the americas division due to a shift in demand from tdma wireless devices  a segment where we previously had a leading product offering  to gsm and cdma  where our key supplier has a relatively weaker market position in gsm and cdma as compared to tdma 
a disparity in our pricing in certain channels relative to a certain mobile operator s subsidized pricing further contributed to the decline 
additionally  we experienced decline in india cdma volumes 
our entry into finland with a distribution business model and a general increase in demand in our european division  particularly for high end wireless data devices  partially offset the decrease

the pressure on average selling price caused by this action was mostly limited to the second quarter 
our australia business experienced a decline in average selling price excluding the effects of foreign currency fluctuations due to a notable shift in demand to lower end wireless devices 
this shift was a function of a key mobile operator promoting and subsidizing low end prepaid wireless devices and subscriptions 
logistic services revenue increased as a result of a increase in the sales of prepaid airtime  which was up across all three divisions  and a increase in wireless devices handled 
the increase in sales of prepaid airtime was a result of the continued success of prepaid airtime offerings by our customers such as tele  vodafone  sfr and virgin mobile  and the continued expansion of our electronic recharge terminals in our europe division 
the strength and relatively large scale of our americas logistic services business  combined with our entry into the slovak republic with a logistic services offering and an increase in demand by a key logistic services customer in australia  generated the significant increase in wireless devices handled through logistic services

the significant sales mix shift toward logistic services  combined with the lower gross profit yield per unit  explain the lower growth in gross profit as compared to the growth in wireless devices handled 
logistic services generally requires less invested capital and sales and administrative resources and has a lower risk profile than distribution  therefore  logistic services generally warrants a lower gross profit per unit 
improved efficiencies due to higher volumes and productivity improvements also contributed to the increase in gross profit

earnings per diluted share was  as compared to in return on invested capital from operations  liquidity and capital resources return on invested capital from operations roic we believe that it is equally as important for a business to manage its balance sheet as its statement of operations 
a measurement that ties the statement of operation performance with the balance sheet performance is return on invested capital from operations  or roic 
we believe if we are able to grow our earnings while minimizing the use of invested capital  we will be optimizing shareholder value and concurrently preserving resources in preparation for further potential growth opportunities 
we take a simple approach in calculating roic we apply an estimated average tax rate to the operating income of our continuing operations with adjustments for unusual items  such as facility consolidation charges  and apply this tax adjusted operating income to our average capital base  which  in our case  is our shareholders equity and debt 
the details of this measurement for  and are outlined below 
year ended december  amounts in s operating income after taxes operating income from continuing operations plus facility consolidation charge benefit less estimated income taxes operating income after taxes invested capital debt shareholders equity invested capital average invested capital roic estimated income taxes were calculated by multiplying the sum of operating income from continuing operations and the facility consolidation charge by the respective periods effective tax rate 

table of contents average invested capital for annual periods represents the simple average of the invested capital amounts for the prior year end and at each quarter end in the respective annual period 
roic is calculated by dividing operating income after taxes by average invested capital 
our roic was approximately for and approximately and for and our roic improved for because our operating income increased while invested capital remained relatively flat 
cash conversion cycle year ended december  days sales outstanding in accounts receivable days inventory on hand days payable outstanding cash conversion cycle days a key source of our liquidity is our ability to invest in inventory  sell the inventory to our customers  pay our suppliers and collect cash from our customers 
we refer to this as the cash conversion cycle 
the cash conversion cycle is measured by the number of days it takes to effect the cycle of investing in inventory  selling the inventory  paying suppliers and collecting cash from customers 
the components in the cash conversion cycle are days of sales outstanding in accounts receivable  days inventory on hand  and days payables outstanding 
the cash conversion cycle  as we measure it  is the netting of days sales outstanding in accounts receivable and days inventory on hand with the days payable outstanding 
circumstances when the cash conversion cycle decreases generally generate cash for the company 
conversely  circumstances when the cash conversion cycle increases generally consume cash in the form of additional investment in working capital 
although our cash conversion cycle increased by day in  we generated cash during primarily due to increased operating income 
during  the cash conversion cycle increased to days from days in the change in the cash conversion cycle was the result of a day increase in the days sales outstanding in accounts receivable  partially offset by a day increase in the number of days payable outstanding 
the increase in the days sales outstanding was due to a higher percentage of our revenue occurring during the fourth quarter during compared to see seasonality  combined with a growth in revenue during the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of in addition  days sales outstanding in accounts receivable increased by almost day due to our decision to discontinue the sale of trade receivables to third party financial institutions in sweden and norway see off balance sheet arrangements accounts receivable transfers 
the increase in days payable outstanding was due to more purchases with suppliers with whom we have longer payment terms at december  compared to a cash conversion cycle of days is a low number for a distribution company and it is unlikely that we can sustain this short cycle in the future 
from time to time  we may pay our suppliers prior to the invoice due date in order to take advantage of early settlement discounts 
increases in the cash conversion cycle could have the effect of consuming our cash  causing us to borrow from lenders or issuing stockholders equity to fund the related increase in working capital 
our potential investments in new markets may cause us to increase our inventory levels in conditions where our customer base is relatively new and whose purchasing behavior is less predictable 
this situation can have the effect of increasing our cash conversion cycle and consequently consume our cash or increase our debt levels 
the detail calculation of the components of the cash conversion cycle is as follows a days sales outstanding in accounts receivable ending accounts receivable for continuing operations divided by average daily revenue inclusive of value added taxes for foreign operations for the period 
b days inventory on hand ending inventory for continuing operations divided by average daily cost of revenue excluding indirect product and service costs for the period 
c days payables outstanding ending accounts payable for continuing operations divided by average daily cost of revenue excluding indirect product and service costs for the period

we prefer our subsidiaries to open local lines of credit to support their borrowing needs 
for subsidiaries where we do not have local lending relationships  we use our foreign finance subsidiary  brightpoint holdings bv  to act as a lender through intercompany loans 
brightpoint holdings bv funds a significant portion of its intercompany loans through deposits from certain subsidiaries  which have generated excess cash 
there are circumstances where subsidiaries utilize both local lenders and our foreign finance subsidiary 
we plan on continuing our pursuit of third party lending relationships in the countries where our subsidiaries conduct business 
brightpoint north america lp entered into an agreement with ge capital in  which has been amended periodically as circumstances warranted changes to the agreement and was amended in to  among other things  increase availability up to a maximum of million 
management believes these amendments have generally been favorable to the company 
we believe that we have developed a good relationship with ge commercial finance  which has led to the inception of facilities in australia in and new zealand in our financial condition has improved significantly since our debt structure as measured by gross debt to total capitalization ratio has dropped from in to in our cash conversion cycle has dropped from over days in to days in this is indicative of improved management of key balance sheet accounts such as accounts receivable  inventory  and accounts payable 
these factors  among others  have improved our risk profile in the eyes of current and potential lenders 
off balance sheet arrangements accounts receivable transfers during the years ended december  and  we entered into certain transactions or agreements with banks and other third party financing organizations in france  norway and sweden  with respect to a portion of their accounts receivable in order to reduce the amount of working capital required to fund such receivables 
these transactions have been treated as sales pursuant to current accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and  accordingly  are accounted for as off balance sheet arrangements 
net funds received reduced the accounts receivable outstanding while increasing cash 
fees incurred are recorded as losses on the sale of assets and are included as a component of other expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
net funds received from the sales of accounts receivable for continuing operations during the years ended december  and  totaled million and million 
fees  in the form of discounts  incurred in connection with these sales totaled million and million during and approximately million and million of these fees relate to continuing operations and are included as a component of other expenses in the consolidated statements of operations in and the remainder of the fees in and was related to the company s former france operations and was included in loss from discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations 

table of contents we are the collection agent on behalf of the bank or other third party financing organization for many of these arrangements and have no significant retained interests or servicing liabilities related to accounts receivable sold 
we may be required to repurchase certain accounts receivable sold in certain circumstances  including  but not limited to  accounts receivable in dispute or otherwise not collectible  accounts receivable in which credit insurance is not maintained and a violation  expiration or early termination of the agreement pursuant to which these arrangements are conducted 
there were no significant repurchases of accounts receivable sold during the years ended december  and these agreements require our subsidiaries to provide collateral in the form of pledged assets and or  in certain situations  a guarantee by the company of its subsidiaries obligations 
pursuant to these arrangements  approximately million and million of trade accounts receivable were sold to and held by banks and other third party financing institutions at december  and amounts held by banks or other financing institutions at december  were for transactions related to our arrangements in norway and sweden 
we decided to discontinue the sale of trade receivables to third party financial institutions in sweden and norway  and therefore  as of january  no trade accounts receivable are held by banks or other third party financing institutions 
we do not anticipate entering into such transactions during capital resources capital expenditures were million  million and million for  and capital expenditures were largely directed toward improving our information systems  particularly in the us  our entries into india and the slovak republic  which included new office space and basic information systems infrastructure and the purchase of operating assets in the us that were previously leased 
expenditures for capital resources historically have been generally composed of information systems  including upgrades and improvements  leasehold improvements for warehouse  office  and retail facilities  and warehouse equipment 
we expect this pattern to continue in future periods 
we expect to invest in a range of million to million in a key component of our strategic plan is geographic expansion 
we expect our level of capital expenditures to be affected by our geographic expansion activity 
on october   we sold of our interest in brightpoint india to persequor in exchange for a management services agreement  in which persequor was to provide management services to brightpoint india for five years ending october  
on the fourth anniversary of the effective date and annually thereafter  persequor has a right to require us to purchase persequor s interest in brightpoint india  and we have the right to require persequor to sell its interest in brightpoint india at a price determined by an appraisal method as defined in the shareholders agreement 
termination of the shareholders agreement is the earlier of i the date on which each of the investors agree in writing or ii the tenth anniversary of the effective date 
during the first quarter of  we purchased persequor  including the interest in brightpoint india 
liquidity analysis we measure liquidity as the summation of total unrestricted cash and unused borrowing availability  and we use this measurement as an indicator of how much access to cash we have to either grow the business through investment in new markets  acquisitions  or through expansion of existing service or product lines or to contend with adversity such as unforeseen operating losses potentially caused by reduced demand for our products and services  a material uncollectible accounts receivable  or a material inventory write down  as examples 
the table below shows our liquidity calculation 
december  change amounts in s unrestricted cash unused borrowing availability liquidity as of december   our liquidity was million  which was up from december  our borrowing availability increased by million and our cash increased by million 
the increase in cash and cash equivalents unrestricted was primarily due to cash provided by operating activities of million  partially offset by the repurchase of million of the company s common stock  million capital expenditures  and million decrease in cash from changes in foreign exchange rates 

table of contents we routinely make large payments  in certain occasions in excess of million  to suppliers and routinely collect large payments from customers  in certain occasions in excess of million 
the timing of these payments or collections has caused our cash balances and borrowings to fluctuate throughout the year 
during  our largest outstanding borrowings on a given day were approximately million with an average outstanding balance of approximately million 
our cash balance as of december   was million 
with an unused borrowing availability of million on december   the company believes it could operate successfully without the million in cash  given that the company continues to generate cash from operating activities 
therefore  we believe we have adequate liquidity to operate the business successfully for the next months and to invest in growth opportunities 
as of december   our gross debt to total capitalization ratio was our cash balance at december   was distributed throughout our subsidiaries worldwide 
however  we had higher concentrations of cash in the us and in asia pacific  which were denominated in us dollars 
although we can generally move funds freely across our subsidiaries  if we were to repatriate funds to the us from foreign subsidiaries we could incur tax consequences  which may cause us to pay higher taxes and consume additional cash as a consequence 
in certain subsidiaries  our local lenders restrict the amount of funds that can be transferred offshore to affiliates and the parent company 
additionally  there are foreign capital restrictions in india  which would restrict our ability to repatriate cash from india 
we currently fund a portion of our discontinued operations with cash generated from our continuing operations 
our total liabilities for discontinued operations were million as of december   and we expect to consume cash in the future to pay these liabilities 
local tax authorities generally review or audit tax returns for discontinued operations 
assessments beyond liabilities that are known and accrued for may result from any tax audit and such assessment could consume additional cash 
credit rating we are rated by standard poor s 
as of december   our rating was b with a positive outlook 
standard poor s upgraded their rating for the company on august  from b to b and changed the outlook for the company on february  from stable to positive 
seasonality the company is subject to seasonal patterns that generally affect the wireless device industry 
wireless devices are generally used by businesses  governments and consumers 
for businesses and governments  purchasing behavior is affected by fiscal year ends  while consumers are affected by holiday gift giving seasons 
for the global wireless device industry  seasonal patterns for wireless device units handled have been as follows year st quarter nd quarter rd quarter th quarter for the company  seasonal patterns for wireless devices handled have been as follows year st quarter nd quarter rd quarter th quarter as can be seen in the table above  the wireless device industry has been prone to experiencing increases in demand in the third and fourth quarter  primarily due to enterprise purchasing for companies whose fiscal year ends coincide with the calendar year end and gift giving holidays 
mobile operators often increase promotional activity  which can further stimulate demand during this period 
conversely  the global wireless industry has experienced decreases in demand in the first quarter subsequent to the higher level of activity in the preceding fourth quarter 

table of contents the company s seasonal patterns are significantly influenced by the global wireless industry s seasonal patterns 
we had a stronger fourth quarter in than in or  which was the result of strong demand and improved product availability in many of the markets where we operate 
the impact of the us gift giving season in the fourth quarter had a greater impact during as evidenced by revenue growth in our americas division compared to the overall growth in revenue during in  our high growth in our asia pacific division  which included our entry into india in the second quarter of  partially caused our seasonal patterns to differ from the global wireless industry 
the chinese new year  which is in the first quarter of each year  historically has had a positive influence in demand in the first quarter 
this has affected demand in certain markets in our asia pacific division 
the gift giving holiday in india generally occurs in october 
in certain markets in the asia pacific division  enterprise and government fiscal years commonly end on june  which historically has had a positive effect on demand in the second quarter 
as compared to the global wireless industry  our seasonality will likely be affected by the quantity of wireless devices handled in markets whose seasonality differs from the global wireless industry 
additionally  should we enter into new markets throughout the year  the additional wireless devices handled in those new markets may affect the distribution of sales across the four quarters of the year as compared to the global wireless and our own historical seasonal patterns 
there can be no assurances that our future seasonal patterns will resemble that of the global wireless industry or that of our own historical patterns 
additionally  interim results may not be indicative of annual results

critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition we recognize revenue when the title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
our total revenue in was billion 
distribution revenue was and logistic services revenue was of our total revenue 
for distribution revenue  which is generally recorded using the gross method  revenue recognition occurs upon shipment to customers and transfer of title 
in some circumstances  the customer may take legal title and assume risk of loss upon delivery and  therefore  revenue is recognized on the delivery date 
sales are recorded net of discounts  rebates  returns and allowances 
as a part of our logistic services we manage and distribute wireless devices and prepaid recharge cards on behalf of various mobile operators and assume little or no ownership risk for the product  other than custodial risk of loss 
under these arrangements we have an agency relationship in the transaction and recognize only the fee associated with serving as an agent 
in other logistic services arrangements  we receive activation commissions for acquiring subscribers on behalf of mobile operators through independent dealer agents or through company owned stores 
in the event activation occurs through an independent dealer agent  a portion of the commission is passed on to the dealer agent 
these arrangements may contain provisions for additional residual commissions based on subscriber usage or for the reduction or elimination of activation commissions if subscribers deactivate service within stipulated periods 
the company recognizes revenue for activation commissions upon activation of the subscriber s service and residual commissions when earned 
an allowance is established for estimated wireless service deactivations as a reduction of accounts receivable and revenues 
product costs we incurred billion in product costs in that were reported within distribution cost of revenue 
on december   we carried million of inventory 
included in our inventory are estimates for reductions of inventory value due to lower market prices than our original purchase prices  estimates for excess inventory and obsolescence risks  supplier incentives earned through purchases but unrealized pending the sale of the related products and estimates for capitalized operating costs related to the handling of inventory 
as of december   our total inventory allowance balance was million and the total amount of capitalized operating costs were million 
included in our cost of goods sold are estimates of supplier incentives associated with products sold  the changes in inventory allowance accounts that result from the actual disposition of products during the period  changes in the capitalization of operating costs and estimates for freight costs 
these estimates are dependent upon monthly and quarterly processes we undertake throughout our operations worldwide 
rapidly changing market conditions may affect the market value of inventory that we have on hand 
because we do not have complete knowledge of the projected disposition of products either through sales to customers  returns to suppliers  or through liquidators  actual results may vary from our estimates 
non product cost of revenue our cost of revenue includes operating expenses that are directly related to the acquisition and production of wireless devices sold through distribution or handled through logistic services 
these operating expenses are comprised of labor  product insurance  facility costs rent  insurance  utilities  etc  warehouse equipment costs and shipping costs 
the allocation of these costs between cost of distribution revenue  cost of logistic services revenue and selling  general and administrative 
table of contents expenses require estimates based on various cost drivers such as square footage or number of employees and other estimation methodologies 
allowances for uncollectible accounts and related provisions we provide credit to certain customers in the ordinary course of business 
through credit analysis processes  credit insurance  and letters of credit  we try to mitigate the risk associated with providing credit 
we are unable to cover our risk entirely and are exposed to potential payment defaults by our customers 
in circumstances in which we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  we record a specific allowance against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize allowances for doubtful accounts based on the length of time the receivables are past due  the current business environment and our historical experience 
as of december   the allowance for doubtful accounts totaled million 
because we do not have complete knowledge on the projected collectibility of amounts owed to us by customers  actual results may vary from our estimates 
deferred taxes and effective tax rates we estimate the effective tax rates and associated liabilities or assets for each legal entity in accordance with sfas we use tax planning to minimize or defer tax liabilities to future periods 
in recording effective tax rates and related liabilities and assets  we rely upon estimates  which are based upon our interpretation of united states and local tax laws as they apply to our legal entities and our overall tax structure 
audits by local tax jurisdictions  including the united states government  could yield different interpretations from our own and cause the company to owe more taxes than originally recorded 
we utilize internal and external skilled resources in the various tax jurisdictions to evaluate our position and to assist in our calculation of tax expense and related liabilities 
for interim periods  we accrue our tax provision at the effective tax rate that we expect for the full year 
as the actual results from our various businesses vary from our estimates earlier in the year  we adjust the succeeding interim period s effective tax rates to reflect our best estimate for the year to date results and for the full year 
as part of the effective tax rate  if we determine that a deferred tax asset arising from temporary differences is not likely to be utilized  we will establish a valuation allowance against that asset to record it at the expected realizable value 
goodwill and long lived asset impairment we assess goodwill for impairment annually  or more frequently when indicators of impairment are present 
at december   we had million of goodwill recorded as an asset 
during the third quarter of  we recorded an million impairment charge related to our decision to sell our operations in france 
we perform our annual impairment analysis during the fourth quarter  and based on our analysis performed in  we determined no additional impairment was necessary for the remaining goodwill balance 
in our impairment analysis we estimate the fair value of an enterprise based on the present value of anticipated future cash flows 
we recognize an impairment loss to the extent the net assets of the enterprise exceed the present value of anticipated future cash flows 
we test our long lived assets for impairment whenever there are indicators that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
as a result of our decision to sell our operations in france  we recognized an impairment charge of approximately million to write down the intangible assets of this entity 
for long lived assets impairment testing  we determine whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets in question is less than their carrying value 
if less  we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values 
fair value is determined by discounted future cash flows  appraisals or other methods 
if the assets determined to be impaired are to be held and used  the company recognizes an impairment charge to the extent the present value of anticipated net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than the asset s carrying value 
the fair value of the asset then becomes the asset s new carrying value  which the company depreciates over the remaining estimated useful life of the asset 
our long lived assets were recorded at their fair value and there were no material impairment charges in  other than the impairment charge related to our france operations

because of the aforementioned uncertainties affecting our future operating results  past performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance  and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate future results or trends 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk concentration of credit risk financial instruments  which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk  consist principally of cash investments  forward currency contracts and accounts receivable 
we maintain cash investments primarily in aaa rated money market mutual funds and overnight repurchase agreements  which have minimal credit risk 
we place forward currency contracts with high credit quality financial institutions in order to minimize credit risk exposure 
concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of geographically dispersed customers 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and generally do not require collateral to secure accounts receivable 
exchange rate risk management a substantial portion of our revenue and expenses are transacted in markets worldwide and may be denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
accordingly  our future results could be adversely affected by a variety of factors  including changes in specific countries political  economic or regulatory conditions and trade protection measures 
our foreign currency risk management program is designed to reduce  but not eliminate  unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by volatility in currency exchange rates by hedging 
generally  through purchase of forward contracts  we hedge transactional currency risk  but do not hedge foreign currency revenue or future operating income 
also  we do not hedge our investment in foreign subsidiaries  where fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may affect our comprehensive income or loss 
at december  and  the face amount of outstanding forward currency contracts to buy us dollars to hedge those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in non functional currencies was million and million 
an adverse change defined as a strengthening of the us dollar in all exchange rates  relative to our foreign currency risk management program  would have had no material impact on our results of operations for or at december   there was no cash flow or net investment hedges open 
our sensitivity analysis of foreign currency exchange rate movements does not factor in a potential change in volumes or local currency prices of our products sold or services provided 
actual results may differ materially from those discussed above 
interest rate risk management we are exposed to potential loss due to changes in interest rates 
investments with interest rate risk include short term marketable securities 
debt with interest rate risk includes the fixed and variable rate debt 
to mitigate interest rate risks  we have  in the past  utilized interest rate swaps to convert certain portions of our variable rate debt to fixed interest rates 
we are exposed to changes in interest rates on our variable interest rate revolving lines of credit 
a increase in short term borrowing rates during the quarter would have resulted in only a nominal increase in interest expense 
we did not have any interest rate swaps outstanding at december
