item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a discussion and analysis of rai s business  initiatives  critical accounting policies and its consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
following the overview and discussion of business initiatives  the critical accounting policies disclose certain accounting policies that are material to rai s results of operations and financial condition for the periods presented in this report 
the discussion and analysis of rai s results of operations is presented in two comparative sections  compared with  and compared with disclosures related to liquidity and financial condition complete management s discussion and analysis 
you should read this discussion and analysis of rai s consolidated financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes as of december  and  and for each of the years in the three year period ended december  overview and business initiatives rai s operating subsidiaries include rjr tobacco  santa fe  lane and gpi 
rai s single reportable operating segment  rjr tobacco  is the second largest cigarette manufacturer in the united states 
rai facilitated the july   transactions to combine the us assets  liabilities and operations of b w with rjr tobacco  a wholly owned operating subsidiary of rjr 
as part of the combination transactions  rai also acquired lane 
santa fe manufactures and markets cigarettes and other tobacco products primarily in the united states 
lane manufactures or distributes cigars  roll your own  cigarette and pipe tobacco brands primarily in the united states 
gpi manufactures and exports cigarettes to us territories  us duty free shops and us overseas military bases  and manages a contract manufacturing business 
rai s operating subsidiaries primarily conduct business in the highly competitive us cigarette market with a few large manufacturers and many smaller participants 
the us cigarette market is believed to be a mature market  and overall consumer demand is expected to continue to decline over time 
trade inventory adjustments may result in short term changes in demand for its operating subsidiaries products if  and when  wholesale and retail tobacco distributors adjust the timing of their purchases of product to manage their inventory levels 
however  rai believes it is not appropriate for it to speculate on external factors that may impact the purchasing decision of the wholesale and retail tobacco distributors 
competition is based primarily on brand positioning and price  as well as product attributes and packaging  consumer loyalty  promotions  advertising and retail presence 
cigarette brands produced by the major manufacturers generally require competitive pricing  substantial marketing support  retail programs and other incentives to maintain or improve a brand s market position or to introduce a new brand 
rai s operating subsidiaries are committed to building and maintaining a portfolio of profitable brands 
rjr tobacco s marketing programs are designed to strengthen brand image  build brand awareness and loyalty and switch adult smokers of competing brands 
in addition to building strong brand equity  rjr tobacco s marketing approach utilizes a retail pricing strategy  including discounting at retail  to defend certain brands shares of market against competitive pricing pressure 
competitive discounting has increased significantly over time as a result of higher state excise taxes and the growth of deep discount brands 
deep discount brands are brands marketed by manufacturers that are not original participants in the msa  and accordingly  do not have cost structures burdened with msa payments to the same extent as the original participating manufacturers 
rjr tobacco s new brand portfolio strategy  which took effect at the beginning of  established three categories of brands investment  selective support and non support 
the investment brands are camel and kool  which receive significant resources focused on accelerating their share of market growth 
the selective support brands include two full price brands  winston and salem  and two savings brands  doral and pall mall  all of which receive limited support in an effort to optimize profitability 
eclipse  a full price brand of cigarettes that primarily heats rather than burns tobacco  is also a selective support brand 
the non support brands are managed to maximize near term profitability 
rjr tobacco 
table of contents expects that  over a four to six year time frame  this focused portfolio strategy will result in growth in total rjr tobacco share  as gains on investment brands offset declines among other brands 
additional business activity includes the second quarter sale of rjr tobacco s packaging operations for million and the fourth quarter gpi acquisition from jti of its us duty free and us overseas military businesses relating to certain brands for million 
in june  rjr completed a private offering of million secured notes and in july  rjr repurchased million of notes due in under a cash tender offer 
in february  rjr completed an exchange offer of million secured registered notes for the million secured notes privately placed in june in january  lane sold its pipe manufacturing business for million 
the financial impacts of these transactions are described in results of operations below 
critical accounting policies and estimates gaap requires estimates and assumptions to be made that affect the reported amounts in rai s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
some of these estimates require difficult  subjective and or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain  and as a result  actual results could differ from those estimates 
due to the estimation processes involved  the following summarized accounting policies and their application are considered to be critical to understanding the business operations  financial condition and results of operations of rai and its subsidiaries 
for information related to these and other significant accounting policies  see note to consolidated financial statements 
purchase accounting rai accounts for business combination transactions in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  referred to as sfas  no 
 business combinations 
sfas no 
requires that rai allocate the cost of the acquisition to assets acquired and liabilities assumed  based on their fair values as of the acquisition date 
estimates of fair values for property  plant and equipment  trademarks and other identifiable intangibles generally are based on independent appraisals  pension and postretirement obligations are based on actuarial studies  and other accounts are based on management s best estimates using assumptions that are believed to be reasonable 
in addition  depreciation of property  plant and equipment and amortization of trademarks and other intangibles with finite lives  are directly related to estimated fair values and estimated useful lives determined as of the acquisition date 
the determination of fair values involves considerable estimation and judgment 
among other things  it requires developing forecasts of cash flows and discount rates for trademarks and other intangibles  selecting appropriate valuation bases and methodologies for property  plant and equipment  determining appropriate actuarial assumptions for pensions and postretirement plans  and determining the number and timing of employees to be terminated or relocated and the associated costs 
the value of goodwill and trademarks and other intangibles with indefinite lives will be subjected to annual impairment testing that could result in future impairment charges 
changes in the useful lives of property  plant and equipment  trademarks or other intangibles could impact depreciation or  in certain situations  impairment charges 
tobacco related litigation rai and rjr tobacco disclose information concerning tobacco related litigation for which an unfavorable outcome is more than remote 
rjr tobacco and its affiliates record their legal expenses and other litigation costs and related administrative costs as selling  general and administrative expenses as those costs are incurred 
rai and rjr tobacco will record any loss related to tobacco litigation at such time as an unfavorable outcome becomes probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
when the reasonable estimate is a range  the recorded loss will be the best estimate within the range 
if no amount in the range is a better estimate than any other amount  the minimum amount of the range will be recorded 
as discussed in note to consolidated financial statements  rjr tobacco and its affiliates  including rai  and indemnitees  including b w  have been named in a number of tobacco related legal actions  proceedings or claims seeking damages in amounts ranging into the hundreds of millions or even billions of 
table of contents dollars 
unfavorable judgments awarding compensatory damages  punitive damages and or fines have been returned against rjr tobacco in the engle class action case  reversed by the intermediate appellate court on may   and now on appeal to the florida supreme court  the scott class action case  a small number of individual smoking and health cases  a broin ii flight attendant ets case and a california state law enforcement action 
rjr tobacco has paid approximately million since related to unfavorable smoking and health judgments  including attorneys fees  primarily for pre acquisition contingencies related to the business combination 
rjr tobacco believes  however  that it has numerous bases for successful appeals in its pending cases  and both rjr tobacco and rai believe they have a number of valid defenses to all actions and intend to defend all actions vigorously 
as a result  rai s management continues to conclude that the loss of any particular smoking and health tobacco litigation claim against rjr tobacco or its affiliates or indemnitees  including b w  when viewed on an individual basis  is not probable 
accordingly  no liability for smoking and health tobacco litigation currently is recorded in rai s consolidated financial statements as of december  as discussed in more detail in note to consolidated financial statements  rjr has liabilities totaling million that were recorded in in connection with certain indemnification claims asserted by jti against rjr and rjr tobacco  relating to the activities of northern brands and related litigation 
litigation is subject to many uncertainties  and it is possible that some of the tobacco related legal actions  proceedings or claims could ultimately be decided against rjr tobacco or its affiliates  including rai  and its indemnitees  including b w 
any unfavorable outcome of such actions could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition  results of operations or cash flows of rai or its subsidiaries 
settlement agreements as discussed in litigation affecting the cigarette industry in note to consolidated financial statements  rjr tobacco  santa fe and lane are participants in the msa  and rjr tobacco is a participant in other state settlement agreements related to governmental health care cost recovery actions 
their obligations and the related expense charges under the msa and other state settlement agreements are subject to adjustments based upon  among other things  the volume of cigarettes sold by the operating subsidiaries  their relative market share and inflation 
since relative market share is based on cigarette shipments  the best estimate of the allocation of charges under these agreements is recorded in cost of products sold as the products are shipped 
adjustments to these estimates  which historically have not been significant  are recorded in the period that the change becomes probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
for more information related to historical and expected settlement expenses and payments under the msa and other state settlement agreements  see governmental health care cost recovery cases msa and other state settlement agreements in note to consolidated financial statements 
intangible assets intangible assets include goodwill  trademarks and other intangibles and are accounted for under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
see note to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the impairment charges in connection with rai s ongoing application of sfas no 
rai generally engages an independent appraisal firm to assist it in determining the fair value of its reporting units and trademarks with indefinite lives annually in the fourth quarter 
the determination of fair value involves considerable estimates and judgment 
in particular  the fair value of a reporting unit involves  among other things  developing forecasts of future cash flows  determining an appropriate discount rate  and when goodwill impairment is implied  determining the fair values of individual assets and liabilities  including unrecorded intangibles 
although rai believes it has based its impairment testing and impairment charges on reasonable estimates and assumptions  the use of different estimates and assumptions could result in materially different results 
generally  if the current competitive environment worsens or rai s operating companies strategic initiatives adversely affect their financial performance  the fair value of goodwill  trademarks and other intangibles could be impaired in future periods 

table of contents pension and postretirement benefits rai and certain of its subsidiaries sponsor a number of non contributory defined benefit pension plans covering most of their employees  and also provide certain health and life insurance benefits for most of their retired employees and their dependents 
these benefits are generally no longer provided to employees hired on or after january  for additional information relating to pension and postretirement benefits  see note to consolidated financial statements 
as part of the business combination transactions  rai assumed certain pension and postretirement benefit obligations and the related assets of former b w plans 
the liability for the projected benefit obligation in excess of plan assets was recorded in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
all previously existing unrecognized net gain or loss  unrecognized prior service cost  or unrecognized transition obligation or asset existing at the date of the business combination were eliminated 
as a result of the business combination  the pension benefit obligation and pension assets increased by billion and billion  respectively  and the postretirement benefit obligation and postretirement assets increased by million and million  respectively 
pension expense is determined in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  and sfas no 
 employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits 
postretirement benefit expense is determined in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
because pension and other postretirement obligations will ultimately be settled in future periods  the determination of annual expense and liabilities is subject to estimates and assumptions 
with the assistance of independent actuarial and investment management firms  rai reviews these assumptions annually based on historic experience and expected future trends or coincidentally with a major event and modifies them as needed 
demographic assumptions such as termination of employment  mortality or retirement are reviewed periodically as expectations change 
gains or losses are annual changes in the amount of either the benefit obligation or the market related value of plan assets resulting from experience different from that assumed or from changes in assumptions 
the minimum amortization of unrecognized gains or losses  as described in sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  is included in pension expense 
prior service costs  which are changes in benefit obligations due to plan amendments  are amortized on a straight line basis over the average remaining service period for active employees 
the market related value of plan assets excludes deferred asset gains of million and recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic and rational manner over five years 
if the market value of assets had been used to determine pension expense  the impact would have been a decrease to the costs of million 
approximately million is attributable to the expected return on asset component of expense and million is due to the gain loss amortization component 
the minimum amortization of unrecognized gains or losses  as described in sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  is also included in the postretirement benefit expense 
prior service costs  which are changes in benefit obligations due to plan amendments  are amortized on a straight line basis over the service to expected full eligibility age for active employees  or average remaining life expectancies for inactive employees if most of the plan obligations are due to inactive employees 
the market related value of plan assets excludes deferred asset gains of million and recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic and rational manner over five years 
if the market value of assets had been used to determine postretirement benefit expense  the impact would have been a decrease to the costs of million  all attributable to the expected return on asset component of expense 

table of contents the most critical assumptions and their sensitivity to change are presented below pension postretirement benefits benefits weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations at december discount rate rate of compensation increase rai uses a hypothetical bond matching analysis to determine the discount rate

a discount rate of was used for the period from january  to august   and adjusted to a discount rate of for the period from september  to december   to reflect the impact of the restructuring plan 
the overall expected long term rate of return on assets assumptions for pension and postretirement assets are based on the target asset allocation for plan assets  long term capital markets forecasts for asset classes employed  and excess return expectations of active management to the extent asset classes are actively managed 

table of contents assumption sensitivity assumed asset return and discount rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the benefit plans 
a one percentage point change in assumed discount rate for the pension plans and other postretirement plans would have the following effects percentage point percentage point increase decrease pensions postretirement pensions postretirement plans plans plans plans effect on net periodic benefit cost effect on december   projected benefit obligation and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation a one percentage point change in assumed asset return would have the following effects percentage point percentage point increase decrease pensions postretirement pensions postretirement plans plans plans plans effect on net periodic benefit cost during  actual asset returns for rjr s pension assets were adversely impacted by the continued deterioration of the equity markets and declining interest rates 
additionally  corporate bond yields  which are used in determining the discount rate for future pension obligations  continued to decline 
the negative asset returns and declining discount rates unfavorably affected rjr s pension plans funded status 
pension expense in was adversely impacted due to these factors and the lowering of the expected return on asset assumption from per annum for to per annum for during  pension plan assets increased million  as a result of the favorable equity market performance  partially offset by benefit payments 
pension benefit obligations increased during greater than expected due to a decline in discount rates

at december   the postretirement benefit obligation of rjr s postretirement plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets by billion 
rai does not expect to pre fund any additional postretirement benefit obligations in the future 

table of contents subsequent to the business combination  rai reviewed the target asset allocations with respect to the former b w plan assets and made slight adjustments 
beginning with  rai has adjusted its expected long term rate of return on pension assets to for its major plans  from and in in  rai implemented a cap on how much it will pay for medical and dental coverage for retirees as a group  excluding pre retirees and former b w retirees 
the cap was raised above previous amounts creating an unrecognized prior service cost of million 
the prior service cost will be amortized over the number of years  on average  it takes for employees to be fully eligible for benefits 
pension expense in is expected to be within a range of million to million  compared with expense of million in  primarily due to increased employer contributions 
postretirement benefit expense in is expected to be within a range of million to million  compared with expense of million in  primarily due to the lower discount rate of 
the amount by which the pension and postretirement benefit obligations exceed the fair value of the plan assets could increase to the extent of a decline in the fair value of plan assets  as well as adverse changes in actuarial assumptions  including a reduction in the discount rate used to calculate the benefit obligations 
rai expects to contribute million to its pension plans in  of which million was contributed in january additional cash funding may be made in the future 
rai expects payments related to its postretirement plans to be million in differences between actual results and actuarial assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods 
in recent years  actual results have varied significantly from actuarial assumptions 
in particular  pension and postretirement liabilities have increased as a result of the decline in the discount rate 
these changes have resulted in charges to comprehensive income 
these changes are expected to result in additional pension and postretirement expense in future years and may also require additional cash funding of the pension obligations in the future 
the target pension asset allocation is us equity investments  including private equity investments  non us equity investments  debt securities  hedge fund investments  and real estate with a rebalancing range of approximately plus or minus to around the target asset allocations 
the target postretirement asset allocation is us equity investments  including private equity investments  non us equity investments  debt securities  hedge fund investments and real estate  and cash with a rebalancing range of approximately plus or minus around the target asset allocations

this enhanced program is estimated to increase expense by an additional million per year 
revenue recognition revenue from product sales is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
for rai s operating subsidiaries  these criteria are generally met when title and risk of loss pass to the customer 
certain sales of leaf  considered as bill and hold for accounting purposes  are recorded as deferred revenue when all of the above revenue recognition criteria are met except delivery  postponed by the customer s request 
revenue is subsequently recognized upon delivery 
shipping and handling costs are classified as cost of products sold 
given the nature of the business of rai s operating subsidiaries  revenue recognition practices contain no significant estimates that could materially affect their results of operations

to the extent that any book and tax differences are temporary in nature  that is  the book realization will occur in a different period than the tax realization  a deferred tax asset or liability is established as required under sfas no 
to the extent that a deferred tax asset is created  management evaluates rai s ability to realize this asset 
management currently believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized 
to the extent a deferred tax liability is established under sfas no 
 it is recorded  tracked and once it becomes currently due and payable  it is paid to the taxing authorities 
in the fourth quarter of  rai recorded an adjustment of million as a decrease in income tax expense and a corresponding decrease in deferred tax liabilities 
this adjustment resulted from differences between the deferred tax liabilities recorded in prior periods and the underlying cumulative timing differences supporting them

in conjunction with the private offering  rjr commenced in june  a cash tender offer for any and all of its then outstanding million of secured notes due may   referred to as the notes  and a consent solicitation to amend the related indenture 
the consents were solicited to approve indenture amendments  which eliminated substantially all of the restrictive covenants and one of the events of default with respect to the notes 
after rjr received the requisite consents to the amendments  rjr  the guarantors of the notes and the indenture trustee entered into a supplemental indenture effecting the amendments  which affect only the notes

any guarantor that is released from its guarantee under rjr s credit facility also will be released automatically from its guarantee of rjr s notes

moody s rating of rjr s guaranteed  secured notes is ba  negative outlook  and s p s rating is bb  negative outlook 
concerns about  or further lowering of  the ratings of rjr s guaranteed  secured notes by s p or moody s could have an adverse impact on rjr s ability to access the debt markets and could increase borrowing costs 
however  given the cash balances of rai and its subsidiaries  rai s management believes that such concerns about  or further lowering of  such ratings would not have a material adverse impact on rai s cash flows

rjr uses interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on a portion of its debt obligations 
under certain conditions  including rjr s guaranteed  secured debt remaining either one level below bbb by s p or baa by moody s  or lower  any fair value that results in a liability position of the interest rate swaps will require full collateralization with cash or securities 
in addition  because rjr and the guarantors  including rai and rjr tobacco  have pledged substantially all of their assets  including the stock of certain of their subsidiaries  to secure their obligations under rjr s credit facility  such pledge also has secured their obligations under these interest rate swap agreements 
rai  rjr and their affiliates were in compliance with all covenants and restrictions imposed by their indebtedness at december  litigation and settlements various legal claims  including litigation claiming that lung cancer and other diseases  as well as addiction  have resulted from the use of  or exposure to  rai s operating subsidiaries products  are pending or may be instituted against rjr tobacco or its affiliates  including rai  or indemnitees  including b w 
in one such pending case  engle v 
rj reynolds tobacco co  a florida state court jury rendered a punitive damages verdict in july  in favor of the florida class of plaintiffs of approximately billion  with approximately billion and billion being assigned to rjr tobacco and b w  respectively 
rjr tobacco  b w and the other defendants appealed this verdict 
on may   florida s third district court of appeal reversed the trial court s final judgment and remanded the case to the dade county circuit court with instructions to decertify the class 
on october   the plaintiffs filed a notice seeking review by the florida supreme court 
on may   the florida supreme court agreed to review the 
table of contents case 
oral argument occurred on november  although rjr tobacco remains confident in the bases for appeal in this case  it cannot predict the final outcome of the appellate process 
for further discussion of the engle case and other litigation and legal proceedings pending against rai or its affiliates or indemnitees  see note to consolidated financial statements 
even though rai s management continues to conclude that the loss of any particular smoking and health tobacco litigation claim against rjr tobacco or its affiliates or indemnitees  when viewed on an individual basis  is not probable  the possibility of material losses related to tobacco litigation is more than remote 
however  rai s management is unable to predict the outcome of such litigation or to reasonably estimate the amount or range of any possible loss 
moreover  notwithstanding the quality of defenses available to it and its affiliates in tobacco related litigation matters  it is possible that rai s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected by the ultimate outcome of certain pending or future litigation matters 
in november  rjr tobacco  b w and the other major us cigarette manufacturers entered into the msa with attorneys general representing most us states  territories and possessions 
as described in note to consolidated financial statements  the msa imposes a stream of future payment obligations on rjr tobacco and the other major us cigarette manufacturers and places significant restrictions on their ability to market and sell cigarettes in the future 
for more information related to historical and expected settlement expenses and payments under the msa and other state settlement agreements  see governmental health care cost recovery cases msa and other state settlement agreements in note to consolidated financial statements 
the msa and other state settlement agreements have materially adversely affected rjr tobacco s shipment volumes 
rai believes that these settlement obligations may materially adversely affect the results of operations  cash flows or financial condition of rai and rjr tobacco in future periods 
the degree of the adverse impact will depend  among other things  on the rate of decline in us cigarette sales in the premium and discount categories  rjr tobacco s share of the domestic premium and discount cigarette categories  and the effect of any resulting cost advantage of manufacturers not subject to the msa and other state settlement agreements 
governmental activity the marketing  sale  taxation and use of cigarettes have been subject to substantial regulation by government and health officials for many years 
various state governments have adopted or are considering  among other things  legislation and regulations that would increase their excise taxes on cigarettes  restrict displays and advertising of tobacco products  establish ignition propensity standards for cigarettes  raise the minimum age to possess or purchase tobacco products  ban the sale of flavored cigarette brands  require the disclosure of ingredients used in the manufacture of tobacco products  impose restrictions on smoking in public and private areas  and restrict the sale of tobacco products directly to consumers or other unlicensed recipients  including over the internet 
in addition  during  the us congress may consider legislation regarding further increases in the federal excise tax  regulation of cigarette manufacturing and sale by the us food and drug administration  amendments to the federal cigarette labeling and advertising act to require additional warnings  reduction or elimination of the tax deductibility of advertising expenses  
table of contents implementation of a national standard for fire safe cigarettes  regulation of the retail sale of cigarettes over the internet and in other non face to face retail transactions  such as by mail order and telephone  and banning of the delivery of cigarettes by the us postal service 
together with manufacturers price increases in recent years and substantial increases in state and federal excise taxes on cigarettes  these developments have had and will likely continue to have an adverse effect on cigarette sales 
cigarettes are subject to substantial excise taxes in the united states 
the federal excise tax per pack of cigarettes is 
all states and the district of columbia currently impose excise taxes at levels ranging from per pack in south carolina to per pack in rhode island 
in  seven state legislatures increased their cigarette excise tax per pack kentucky from to  maine from to  new hampshire from to  north carolina from to with an additional effective in  ohio from to  washington from to and virginia  whose graduated increase of per pack from to passed in  went into effect 
although not a tax increase  idaho voted to make permanent of the state s cigarette excise tax that was scheduled to sunset on june   the tax remains at per pack 
after consideration of these actions  the weighted average state cigarette excise tax per pack  calculated on a month rolling average  is approximately 
several states have pending legislation proposing excise tax increases in certain local and city jurisdictions  such as new york city and chicago  also impose excise taxes on cigarettes sold in those jurisdictions 
in addition  minnesota enacted a health impact fee  effective august   that among other things imposes a per pack fee on cigarettes  which is in addition to its current cigarette excise tax of per pack 
the legislation imposing the health impact fee expressly states that its purpose is to recover for the state health care costs related to or caused by tobacco use 
rjr tobacco and certain other tobacco manufacturers and distributors filed a motion in minnesota state court to enforce provisions of the minnesota settlement agreement  which in the view of rjr tobacco and the other moving parties released any right the state might have to claim additional compensation for such costs  beyond that provided by the ongoing payments made to the state annually pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement 
a hearing on this motion was held on september  on december   the court ruled that the health impact fee violates the terms of the settlement and is unconstitutional 
on december   the state noticed an appeal of the court s ruling and separately sought accelerated review of the trial court s order by the minnesota supreme court 
on january   the parties entered an agreed stipulation that permitted the state to continue to collect the health impact fee during the pendency of all relevant appeals 
on january  the minnesota supreme court agreed to hear the matter on an expedited basis 
the minnesota supreme court indicated that the case will be placed on its april calendar for oral argument 
separately  a class action complaint was filed on january  in the fourth judicial district of minnesota state court on behalf of consumers of cigarettes and other tobacco products in the state of minnesota from august  to the present 
the class action complaint names rjr tobacco and various other entities as defendants  and asserts an unjust enrichment claim  seeks the imposition of a constructive trust with respect to the monies collected pursuant to the health impact fee  and requests that these monies be distributed by the best means practicable to the class members 
the plaintiffs in this action have agreed to have this case transferred to the court presiding over rjr tobacco s motion to enforce the settlement agreement and to have the matter dealt with on a consolidated basis 
in  the report of the advisory committee to the surgeon general of the us public health service concluded that cigarette smoking was a health hazard of sufficient importance to warrant appropriate remedial action 
since  federal law has required a warning statement on cigarette packaging 
since  television and radio advertising of cigarettes has been prohibited in the united states 
cigarette advertising in other media in the united states is required to include information with respect to the tar and nicotine yield of cigarettes  as well as a warning statement 

table of contents during the past four decades  various laws affecting the cigarette industry have been enacted 
in  congress enacted the comprehensive smoking education act 
among other things  this act establishes an interagency committee on smoking and health that is charged with carrying out a program to inform the public of any dangers to human health presented by cigarette smoking  requires a series of four health warnings to be printed on cigarette packages and advertising on a rotating basis  increases type size and area of the warning required in cigarette advertisements  and requires that cigarette manufacturers provide annually  on a confidential basis  a list of ingredients added to tobacco in the manufacture of cigarettes to the secretary of health and human services 
the warnings currently required on cigarette packages and advertisements are surgeon general s warning smoking causes lung cancer  heart disease  emphysema  and may complicate pregnancy  surgeon general s warning quitting smoking now greatly reduces serious risks to your health  surgeon general s warning smoking by pregnant women may result in fetal injury  premature birth  and low birth weight  and surgeon general s warning cigarette smoke contains carbon monoxide 
since the initial report in  the secretary of health  education and welfare now the secretary of health and human services and the surgeon general have issued a number of other reports which purport to find the nicotine in cigarettes addictive and to link cigarette smoking and exposure to cigarette smoke with certain health hazards  including various types of cancer  coronary heart disease and chronic obstructive lung disease 
these reports have recommended various governmental measures to reduce the incidence of smoking 
in  the federal alcohol  drug abuse and mental health act was signed into law 
this act requires states to adopt a minimum age of for purchases of tobacco products and to establish a system to monitor  report and reduce the illegal sale of tobacco products to minors in order to continue receiving federal funding for mental health and drug abuse programs 
in january  the us department of health and human services announced regulations implementing this legislation 
legislation imposing various restrictions on public smoking also has been enacted in states and many local jurisdictions  and many employers have initiated programs restricting or eliminating smoking in the workplace 
a number of states have enacted legislation designating a portion of increased cigarette excise taxes to fund either anti smoking programs  health care programs or cancer research 
in addition  educational and research programs addressing health care issues related to smoking are being funded from industry payments made or to be made under settlements with state attorneys general 
federal law prohibits smoking in scheduled passenger aircraft  and the us interstate commerce commission has banned smoking on buses transporting passengers interstate 
certain common carriers have imposed additional restrictions on passenger smoking 
in december  the california environmental protection agency air resources board issued a proposed identification of environmental tobacco smoke as a toxic air contaminant for public review 
on january   the air resources board identified environmental tobacco smoke as a toxic air contaminant  following a three year administrative process 
the air resources board is now required to prepare a report assessing the need and appropriate degree of control of environmental tobacco smoke 
rjr tobacco cannot predict the form any future california regulation may take 
several states have enacted or have proposed legislation or regulations that would require cigarette manufacturers to disclose the ingredients used in the manufacture of cigarettes 
in september  the massachusetts department of public health  referred to as the mdph  announced its intention to hold public hearings on amendments to its tobacco regulations 
the proposed regulations would delete any ingredients 
table of contents reporting requirement 
the united states court of appeals for the first circuit previously affirmed a ruling that the massachusetts ingredient reporting law was unconstitutional 
mdph also has proposed to inaugurate extensive changes to its regulations requiring tobacco companies to report nicotine yield ratings for cigarettes according to methods prescribed by mdph 
because mdph withdrew its notice for a public hearing in november  it is impossible to predict the final form any new regulations will take or the effect they will have on the business or results of operations of rjr tobacco 
in june  the new york state legislature passed legislation charging the state s office of fire prevention and control with developing standards for fire safe or self extinguishing cigarettes 
on december   ofpc issued a final standard with accompanying regulations that requires all cigarettes offered for sale in new york state after june   to achieve specified test results when placed on ten layers of filter paper in controlled laboratory conditions 
the cigarettes that rai s operating companies sell in new york state comply with this standard 
in  california and vermont each enacted fire safe legislation of its own  adopting the same testing standard set forth in the ofpc regulations described above 
this requirement will take effect in vermont on may   and in california on january  similar legislation is being considered in a number of other states 
varying standards from state to state could have an adverse effect on the business or results of operations of rjr tobacco 
a price differential exists between cigarettes manufactured for sale abroad and cigarettes manufactured for us sale 
consequently  a domestic gray market has developed in cigarettes manufactured for sale abroad  but instead diverted for domestic sales that compete with cigarettes that rjr tobacco manufactures for domestic sale 
the us federal government and all states  except massachusetts  have enacted legislation prohibiting the sale and distribution of gray market cigarettes 
in addition  rjr tobacco has taken legal action against certain distributors and retailers who engage in such practices 
rjr tobacco expects to benefit from certain state legislative activity aimed at leveling the playing field between original participating manufacturers under the msa and nonparticipating manufacturers under the msa  referred to as npms 
forty six states have passed legislation to ensure npms are making required escrow payments 
under this legislation  a state would only permit distribution of brands by manufacturers who are deemed by the states to be msa compliant 
failure to make escrow payments could result in the loss of an npm s ability to sell tobacco products in a respective state 
early efforts to enact legislation  from to early  resulted in a range of npm laws  some containing only minimal requirements 
however  once the national association of attorneys general  referred to as naag  became involved in the legislative initiative  model complementary npm language was developed and introduced in the states where either no npm laws existed or where existing laws needed to be amended to bring them in line with the model language 
additionally  states have enacted legislation that closes a loophole in the msa 
the loophole allows npms that concentrate their sales in a single state  or a limited number of states  to recover most of the funds from their escrow accounts 
to obtain the refunds  the manufacturers must establish that their escrow deposit was greater than the amount the state would have received had the manufacturer been a subsequent participating manufacturer under the msa ie  the state s allocable share 
naag has endorsed adoption of the allocable share legislation needed to eliminate this loophole 
following a challenge by npms  the united states district court for the southern district of new york has issued an order enjoining new york from enforcing allocable share legislation 
it is possible that npms will challenge allocable share legislation passed in other states 
finally  four states  alaska  michigan  minnesota and utah  have enacted equity assessments on npms products 
this legislative initiative has not been endorsed by naag  and one npm has filed a challenge to the equity assessment in michigan 
thirty three states by statute or court rule have limited  and several additional states are considering limiting  the amount of the bonds required to file an appeal of an adverse judgment in state court 
the limitation on the amount of such bonds generally ranges from million to million 
such bonding statutes allow defendants that are subject to large adverse judgments  such as cigarette manufacturers  to 
table of contents reasonably bond such judgments and pursue the appellate process 
in six other jurisdictions  the filing of a notice of appeal automatically stays the judgment of the trial court 
on may   the world health organization adopted a broad tobacco control treaty 
the treaty recommends and requires enactment of legislation establishing specific actions to prevent youth smoking  restrict and gradually eliminate tobacco products marketing  provide greater regulation and disclosure of ingredients  increase the size and scope of package warning labels to cover at least of each package and include graphic pictures on packages 
the treaty entered into force on february  days after ratification by the th country 
within a year of entering into force  a subsidiary body  the conference of the parties  will begin meeting to review national reports  provide further guidance on proper implementation of the treaty  initiate protocol negotiations and promote the mobilization of financial resources 
although the us delegate to the world health organization voted for the treaty in may  and the secretary for health and human services signed the document in may  it is not known whether the treaty will be sent to the us senate for ratification 
ratification of the treaty by the united states could lead to broader regulation of the industry 
it is not possible to determine what additional federal  state or local legislation or regulations relating to smoking or cigarettes will be enacted or to predict the effect of new legislation or regulations on rjr tobacco or the cigarette industry in general  but any new legislation or regulations could have an adverse effect on rjr tobacco or the cigarette industry in general 
tobacco buyout legislation on october   the president signed fetra  eliminating the us government s tobacco production controls and price support program 
the buyout of tobacco quota holders provided for in fetra is funded by a direct quarterly assessment on every tobacco product manufacturer and importer  on a market share basis measured on volume to which federal excise tax is applied 
the aggregate cost of the buyout to the industry is approximately billion  including approximately billion payable to quota tobacco holders and growers through industry assessments over ten years and approximately million for the liquidation of quota tobacco stock 
as a result of the tobacco buyout legislation  the msa phase ii obligations established in will be continued as scheduled through the end of  but will be offset against the tobacco quota buyout obligations 
rai s operating subsidiaries annual expense under fetra  excluding the tobacco stock liquidation assessment  is estimated to be approximately million 
rai s operating subsidiaries incurred million in related to assessments from quota tobacco stock liquidation 
of these amounts  approximately million has been paid through the fourth quarter of  and the remaining amount is scheduled to be paid  quarterly  by december  remaining contingent liabilities for liquidation of quota tobacco stock  if any  will be recorded when an assessment is made 
rai s operating subsidiaries will record the fetra assessment on a quarterly basis upon required notification of assessments 
rai s operating subsidiaries estimate that their overall share of the buyout will approximate billion to billion prior to the deduction of permitted offsets under the msa 
in addition  future market pricing could impact the carrying value of inventory  and adversely affect rjr tobacco s financial condition and results of operations 
of the accrued but unpaid msa phase ii obligations  million was reversed in the fourth quarter of  and million was reversed in the first six months of on december   the north carolina business court held that rjr tobacco was entitled to a refund of its first three quarterly msa phase ii payments made for of approximately million  and was not obligated to make its fourth quarter payment of approximately million 
on august   the north carolina supreme court reversed the lower court s decision  and remanded the case back to the north carolina business court  where the msa phase ii payments of approximately million previously made for were released to the beneficiaries of the growers trust 
on october   the north carolina business court denied rjr tobacco s motion for additional proceedings on the issue of the payment of the fourth quarter msa phase ii payment of approximately million  ordered rjr tobacco to make this payment within ten business days and ordered rjr tobacco to pay pre judgment interest 
pursuant to that order and an agreement with the trustee of the growers trust  rjr tobacco paid  in the fourth quarter
