item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations certain statements set forth below under this caption constitute forward looking statements 
see business special note regarding forward looking statements in item of this report for additional factors relating to such statements  and see risk factors in item a of this report for a discussion of certain risk factors applicable to our business  financial condition and results of operations 
business overview and presentation we provide local telecommunications and related services  long distance services and wireless  data and video services within our local service area  which consists of the state region of arizona  colorado  idaho  iowa  minnesota  montana  nebraska  new mexico  north dakota  oregon  south dakota  utah  washington and wyoming 
we also provide reliable  scalable and secure broadband data and voice including long distance communications outside our local service area as well as globally 
we previously provided directory publishing services in our local service area 
in november  we sold our directory publishing business in seven of the states in which we offered these services 
in september  we sold the directory publishing business in the remaining states 
as a consequence  the results of operations of our directory publishing business are included in income from discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations 
our analysis presented below is organized to provide the information we believe will be instructive for understanding the relevant trends going forward 
however  this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements in item of this report  including the notes thereto 
our operating revenue is generated from our wireline services  wireless services and other services segments 
an overview of the segment results is provided in note segment information to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
segment discussions reflect the way we currently report our segment results to our chief operating decision maker  or codm  and include revenue results for each of our customer channels within the wireline services segment business  mass markets and wholesale 
in order to better serve the similar needs of our small business and consumer customers  in we combined these customers into a new channel  which we refer to as mass markets  and have reclassified our small business customers for all periods presented 
certain prior year revenue and expense amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentations 
business trends our financial results continue to be impacted by several significant trends  which are described below access line losses 
our revenue has been  and we expect it to continue to be  adversely affected by access line losses 
increased competition  including product substitution  continues to be the primary reason for our access line losses 
for example  consumers are increasingly substituting cable and wireless telecommunications services for traditional telecommunications services  which has increased the number and type of competitors within our industry and decreased our market share 
product bundling  as described more fully below  has been one of our responses to our declining revenue due to access line losses 
product bundling 
we believe consumers increasingly value the convenience of receiving multiple services from a single provider 
as such  we increased our marketing and advertising spending levels in focusing on product bundling and packaging 
product bundles and packages represent combinations of products and services  such as local voice  high speed internet and wireless  and features and services  such as three way calling and call forwarding related to an access line 
as a result of these offerings  we have seen increased sales primarily of our long distance and high speed internet products and services 
variable expenses 
expenses associated with higher growth products  such as long distance  high speed internet and wireless services  tend to be more variable in nature 
while our traditional 
table of contents telecommunications services tend to rely upon our fixed cost structure  the mix of products we expect to sell  combined with regulatory and market pricing forces  will continue to pressure operating margins 
in addition  facility costs described below are not always reduced proportionally with revenue fluctuations due to contractual cost commitments 
facility costs 
facility costs are third party telecommunications expenses we incur to connect our customers to networks or to end user product platforms not owned by us 
we have benefited in this area from the renegotiation  termination or settlement of various service arrangements  from network optimization initiatives and from regulatory approvals allowing us to provide long distance services in our local service area using our own network  thereby decreasing our reliance on third party providers 
however  these benefits have been offset in varying degrees by increased costs due to increased long distance traffic and data and internet volumes and by new wireless facility costs due to our use of a third party wireless provider 
operational efficiencies 
we have continued to evaluate our operating structure and focus  and we continue to right size our workforce in response to changes in the telecommunications industry 
through targeted restructuring plans in prior years  focused improvements in operational efficiency  process improvements through automation and normal employee attrition  we have reduced our workforce and employee related costs while achieving operational goals 
while these trends are important to understanding and evaluating our financial results  the other transactions  events and trends discussed in risk factors in item a of this report may also materially impact our business operations and financial results 
results of operations overview we generate revenue from our wireline services  wireless services and other services 
depending on the products or services purchased  a customer may pay an up front or monthly fee  a usage charge or a combination of these 
wireline services 
the wireline services segment uses our network to provide voice services and data and internet services to mass markets which include consumer and small business customers  business and wholesale customers 
our wireline services include voice services 
voice services revenue includes local voice services  long distance voice services and access services 
local voice services revenue includes revenue from basic local exchange services  switching services  custom calling features  enhanced voice services  operator services  collocation services and related equipment 
local voice services revenue also includes revenue from the provision of network transport  billing services and access to our local network on a wholesale basis 
long distance voice services revenue includes revenue from interlata and intralata long distance services 
access services revenue includes fees charged to other data and telecommunications providers to connect their customers and their network to our network 
data and internet services 
data and internet services revenue includes data services such as traditional private lines  wholesale private lines  frame relay  atm and related equipment and internet services such as high speed internet  isdn  vpn  web hosting  professional services and related equipment 
wireless services 
we offer wireless services and equipment to residential and business customers  providing them the ability to use the same telephone number for their wireless phone as for their home or business phone 
in august  we entered into a services agreement with a third party provider that allows us to resell wireless services  including access to its nationwide pcs wireless network  to mass markets and business customers  primarily in the states within our local service area 
other services 
other services revenue is predominantly derived from the sublease of some of our real estate  such as space in our office buildings  warehouses and other properties

the decrease in local voice services revenue in our business and mass markets channels was primarily due to access line losses from competitive pressures including technology substitution  partially offset by an increase in universal service fund  or usf  revenue due to long distance revenue growth and usf rate increases 
in our mass markets channel we have seen a slowing of access line losses  and this  combined with rate increases in this channel  has decreased our rate of revenue decline from in to in the decrease in our wholesale channel was primarily due to the sale of a large portion of our payphone business in august partially offset by une increases  including our non tariff product 
in addition  wholesale access lines decreased along with sales of unes and related operator and billing services to local competitors as an increasing percentage of competition in our local area is coming from facilities based competition  including wireless and cable companies 

table of contents the following table shows our access lines by channel as of december  and access lines years ended december  increase decrease percentage change v v in thousands mass markets business wholesale total we may modify the channel classification of our access lines from time to time in our efforts to better approximate the related revenue channels and better reflect how we manage our business 
long distance services 
the increase in mass markets long distance services revenue was primarily due to i a increase in in region long distance subscribers adding  subscribers in ii increased minutes of use  iii increases in our monthly recurring charges  and iv increased participation in our unlimited plan 
these increases were partially offset by out of region declines in both mass markets and business 
the wholesale revenue increase was driven by volume and domestic rate increases partially offset by decreased international volume and rates 
access services 
access services revenue continues to be negatively affected by mass markets and business access line losses  as well as our increasing penetration into in region long distance as we became a competitor to our access services customers 
the decrease in total access services was partially offset by favorable settlements of customer billing disputes during data and internet services the increase in business data and internet services revenue was driven by the recognition of million in revenue from a large government cpe and other data services arrangement and increased revenue related to wan including iq and upn and private line services  partially offset by a decrease in frame relay revenue 
we anticipate that the large government cpe and other data services arrangement will continue to positively impact our revenue growth  although to a lesser extent  for the next few quarters as this contract is completed 
the increase in mass markets data and internet services revenue was primarily driven by a increase in the number of high speed internet subscribers as we expanded our high speed internet service area to of our local service area in from in this growth came from continued expansion of service availability and increased penetration of high speed internet where service is available 
we believe this growth was supported by our expanded marketing efforts 
the decline in our wholesale channel was due to the termination of our wholesale modem services product in april partially offset by increases in frame relay  private line and dedicated internet access revenue 
wireless services revenue wireless services revenue increased primarily due to increased price plan and airtime rates for new subscribers resulting in higher average revenue per subscriber 
although the average number of subscribers for declined as compared to  total subscribers as of december  increased from december

the decrease in our local voice services revenue was primarily due to access line losses from competitive pressures including technology substitution and was also impacted by our customers migrating to our package offerings  which generally offer lower pricing than our stand alone products 
in particular  in and  a significant portion of the losses of our mass markets and business access lines was attributable to the clecs use of une p and unbundled local loops to deliver voice services 
these losses were partially offset by corresponding increases in our wholesale access lines where unes are reflected in our wholesale channel 
however  the regulated price structure of unes applied downward pressure on our revenue

table of contents we may modify the channel classification of our access lines from time to time in our efforts to better approximate the related revenue channels and better reflect how we manage our business 
long distance services 
the decrease in local voice services revenue was partially offset by an increase in long distance services revenue 
in january  we began to receive regulatory approval to offer long distance service in each state within our state region 
in the fourth quarter of  we received regulatory approval for the last of our in region states 
as we received regulatory approval in each of the states  we began to increase the marketing and promotion of interlata long distance service to our customers  resulting in growth of in region long distance services revenue 
in total  million and million long distance subscribers were added in our state region in and  respectively 
in contrast  out of region long distance mass markets and business revenue declined due to continuing competitive pressures  including pricing pressures 
wholesale long distance revenue increased due to increased international and domestic long distance call volume  partially offset by lower rates 
access services 
the decrease in access services was primarily due to lower volumes resulting from our re entry into in region long distance as we became a competitor to our access services customers and access line losses 
data and internet services data and internet services revenue increased due to increases in our high speed internet  internet hosting and vpn offerings  and broadband services continued to be expanded geographically to make our high speed internet service available to more customers 
the number of mass markets high speed internet subscribers grew by  and we expanded our high speed internet service area to of our local service area in  however  the impact of increases in mass markets high speed internet subscribers and related revenue was offset in part by decreases in wholesale data and internet services revenue 
wireless services revenue the decrease in our wireless revenue is primarily attributable to a net loss of  or of subscribers in a portion of the loss of subscribers occurred in connection with the migration  completed in  of our customers to a third party network and tightened credit policies 
operating expenses this section should be read in conjunction with our business trends discussed above 

table of contents compared to the following table provides further detail regarding our operating expenses years ended december  increase decrease percentage change v v dollars in millions operating expenses cost of sales facility costs network expenses employee related costs other non employee related costs total cost of sales selling  general and administrative property and other taxes bad debt restructuring  realignment and severance related costs employee related costs other non employee related costs total selling  general and administrative depreciation capitalized software and other intangible assets amortization asset impairment charges nm total operating expenses nm percentages greater than and comparisons from positive to negative values or to zero values are considered not meaningful 
cost of sales cost of sales includes employee related costs  such as salaries  wages and benefits directly attributable to products or services  network expenses  facility costs and other non employee related costs such as real estate  usf charges  call termination fees  materials and supplies  contracted engineering services  computer system support and the cost of cpe sold 
cost of sales as a percentage of revenue decreased from in to in primarily due to decreased facility and employee related costs as described below 
facility costs decreased largely due to cost savings primarily from network optimization efforts including the renegotiation  termination or settlement of service arrangements 
these benefits were partially offset by approximately million in increases associated with reselling wireless through a third party as opposed to operating and maintaining our own wireless network and higher long distance volumes 
employee related costs decreased primarily due to a employee reduction from our prior year restructuring plans as well as a continued focus on containing our employee related costs and productivity improvements 
other non employee related costs increased primarily due to non recurring costs associated with the large government cpe and other data services arrangement described above 
the remaining fluctuation is primarily due to increased call termination fees related primarily to a favorable settlement in  and usf rate increases  offset by decreased equipment costs related to our wireless and high speed internet products 

table of contents selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expenses include employee related costs such as salaries  wages and benefits not directly attributable to products or services  severance related costs  sales commissions  bad debt charges and other non employee related costs such as property taxes  real estate costs  advertising  professional service fees and computer systems support 
sg a expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from in to in primarily due to million of reserves recorded in related to litigation matters and employee related costs primarily due to prior year restructuring as described below 
our property and other taxes decreased primarily due to favorable property tax settlements in in excess of property tax settlements in bad debt expense decreased primarily due to the continued trend of improved wireline collections resulting in reduced days sales outstanding  partially offset by favorable bad debt settlements in restructuring  realignment and severance related costs decreased due to a charge of million in the second quarter of resulting from a planned workforce reduction 
employee related costs decreased primarily due to employee reductions from our restructuring efforts  normal attrition and productivity improvements 
other non employee related costs decreased for the year ended december  primarily due to million of reserves recorded in related to litigation matters and reductions in legal and other costs in this decrease was partially offset by increased marketing and advertising costs 
pension and post retirement benefits 
we sponsor noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of our employees 
our post retirement benefit plans for current and certain future retirees include healthcare and life insurance coverage 
our pension and post retirement benefit expense of million increased from the expense of million 
increases in expense were due to a reduction in the expected return on assets of million related primarily to the five year smoothing convention used for recognizing gains and losses on the pension plan assets  completion of the amortization of million for the transition asset in the pension plan in  and recognition of million in higher actuarial losses 
offsetting decreases in expense were due to million in lower service costs due to reduced headcount and fewer eligible participants  reduced interest costs of million due to lower discount rates  changes in participant demographics and assumption changes  and million due to plan design changes affecting prior service costs 
at december  and the net unrecognized actuarial loss related to the pension and post retirement benefit plans decreased by million and million  respectively 
differences between expected and actual rates of return on assets  discount rates applied to the pension and post retirement plan obligations  expected benefit from medicare part d reimbursements and healthcare claims experience are the primary components of the net unrecognized actuarial gain loss 
the difference created between the expected return on assets and the actual net earnings on the assets is deferred at the end of the year and classified as an unrecognized net actuarial gain loss 
lower than expected earnings create losses and higher than expected earnings create gains 
similarly  the difference between the discount rate at the beginning of the year and the discount rate at the end of the year is deferred at the end of the year and classified as an unrecognized net actuarial gain loss 
lower than expected discount rates create losses and higher than expected discount rates create gains 
unrecognized net actuarial losses are similar to deferred costs and are amortized to expense over to years based on the average remaining service period of the employees expected to receive benefits in accordance with pension and post retirement benefit accounting rules 
the impact of recognizing amortization of the net actuarial losses increased the net cost included in current 
table of contents earnings by million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
net unrecognized actuarial losses increase the prepaid pension asset and lower the post retirement liability recorded in the financial statements while net unrecognized actuarial gains decrease the prepaid pension asset and increase the post retirement liability 
a significant decrease in net unrecognized actuarial losses is more likely to occur as a result of changes in the debt and equity markets than through amortization 
for additional information on our pension and post retirement plans see note employee benefits to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
operating expenses by segment segment expenses include employee related costs  facility costs  network expenses and other non employee related costs such as customer support  collections and marketing 
we manage indirect administrative services costs such as finance  information technology  real estate and legal centrally  consequently  these costs are included in the other services segment 
we evaluate depreciation  amortization  interest expense  interest income  and other income expense on a total company basis 
as a result  these charges are not assigned to any segment 
similarly  we do not include impairment charges in the segment results 
our codm regularly reviews the results of operations at a segment level to evaluate the performance of each segment and allocate resources based on segment income

as a result of this transition  beginning in the third quarter of  we realized savings in depreciation and other non employee related costs such as real estate costs  network costs and professional fees 
in addition  other non employee related costs decreased due to decreased marketing and advertising directly attributable to our wireless product 
we expect our facility costs as a percentage of wireless revenue to remain relatively constant subject to certain volume discounts as volumes increase 
wireless bad debt increased due to a change in the application of our credit policy and a decline in collections 
other services segment expenses other services expenses include corporate expenses for services such as finance  information technology  legal  marketing services and human resources  which we centrally manage and are not assigned to the wireline or wireless services segments

cost of sales as a percentage of revenue decreased from in to in due to decreased facility and employee related costs as described below 
facility costs decreased primarily due to the renegotiation  termination or settlement of service arrangements and network optimization initiatives 
these activities resulted in savings during the period of over million  of which approximately million were caused by one time termination charges in additionally  we experienced a decrease of approximately million as a result of reduction in our reliance on third party facility providers 
these additional decreases were more than offset by i international  mass markets and wholesale long distance volume increases  ii facility costs associated with the increase in long distance revenue in our local service area and iii commencement of usage of a third party wireless network as we migrated our wireless customers 
the decrease in network costs was primarily due to improved maintenance and right of way costs related to our out of region network 
the decrease in employee related costs was primarily due to employee reductions from our restructuring efforts  normal attrition and productivity improvements 

table of contents other non employee related costs increased primarily due to increased equipment costs for high speed internet modems as a result of subscriber growth and for wireless handsets as a result of the transition of our customers to a third party wireless network  and increased voice data cpe costs 
the higher equipment costs were partially offset by favorable call termination fees  reduced materials purchases and external commissions 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses include employee related costs such as salaries  wages and benefits not directly attributable to products or services  severance related costs  sales commissions  bad debt charges and other non employee related costs such as property taxes  real estate costs  advertising  professional service fees and computer systems support 
sg a expenses as a percentage of revenue increased from in to in primarily due to increased litigation expenses and restructuring  realignment and severance costs as described below 
the decrease in property and other taxes was primarily due to reduced property values as a result of our impairments and favorable settlements in the decrease in bad debt expense was primarily due to a favorable settlement of approximately million in the second quarter from customers emerging from bankruptcy  and improved credit policies and collection processes 
the increase in restructuring  realignment and severance related costs was primarily due to our restructuring plan pursuant to which we reduced  employees in certain job functions  including information technology  network construction  customer installations  sales and back office areas  in response to continued declines in revenue and our plans for improved operational efficiencies 
million of the increase in restructuring costs was due to changes in sublease projections for idle real estate properties 
the decrease in employee related expenses was due to employee reductions related to the above mentioned restructuring plans 
the increase in other non employee related costs was primarily attributable to the million of charges recorded in and the million recorded in for litigation matters that are further discussed in legal proceedings in item of this report 
pension and post retirement benefits 
our pension and post retirement benefit expense of million decreased from the expense of million 
decreases in expense were due to recognition of million in lower actuarial losses partially due to the recognition of the medicare part d benefit  million in lower service costs due to reduced headcount and fewer covered participants  a reduction in interest costs of million due to lower discount rates and a reduction of million due to plan design changes affecting prior service costs 
these decreases are partially offset by increases in expense due to a reduction in the expected return on assets of million related primarily due to the reduction in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets from to and lower amortization of million due to the completion of the amortization for the transition asset in the pension plan in operating expenses by segment segment expenses include employee related costs  facility costs  network expenses and other non employee related costs such as customer support  collections and marketing 
we manage indirect administrative services costs such as finance  information technology  real estate and legal centrally  consequently  these costs are assigned to the other services segment

wireless operating expenses increased  primarily due to facility and network costs associated with the costs of transitioning wireless services to a third party provider 
these facility and network costs included usage and roaming costs associated with our use of the third party provider s network and development costs associated with the migration of our customers to the third party provider s network 
other non employee related costs increased due to additional marketing and advertising costs as we aggressively marketed our new wireless products

this increase was partially offset by lower hardware  software and maintenance costs resulting from such outsourcing 
partially offsetting the increase in other non employee related costs were lower employee related costs  attributable to decreases in salaries and wages and overtime related to our agreement to outsource certain information technology services and lower property and other taxes due to changes in property tax estimates and a one time million expense reduction from a successful property tax appeal 
non segment operating expenses years ended december  increase decrease percentage change v v v v dollars in millions depreciation capitalized software and other intangible assets amortization asset impairment charges nm nm percentages greater than and comparisons from positive to negative values or to zero values are considered not meaningful 
depreciation the decreases in depreciation were primarily the result of reduced capital expenditures beginning in as well as asset impairment charges  recorded in and  which resulted in decreases in the depreciable basis of our fixed assets 
the level of depreciation in all three years is lower than in previous years due to our impairment of assets in capitalized software and other intangible assets amortization the increase in amortization expense from to was attributable to the increase in total capitalized software 
the decrease from to was primarily due to the completion of amortization for a number of intangible assets 

table of contents asset impairment charges in conjunction with our efforts to sell certain assets during  we determined that the carrying amounts of those assets were in excess of our expected sales proceeds 
this  in addition to the abandonment of various leased long term network capacity routes  resulted in an asset impairment charge of million in the asset impairment charges of million were due to the anticipated decrease in usage of our wireless network following the transition of our customers onto a third party network

interest expense decreased from to primarily due to the expensing of unamortized debt issue costs associated with the early termination of a previous credit facility in and from to primarily due to the significant pay down of debt in using cash proceeds from the sale of our directory business 
we expect that our interest expense will decline by approximately million in as a result of our debt restructuring activity 
see note borrowings to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report for further information 
loss gain on early retirement of debt net 
the loss on early retirement of debt was primarily due to the payment of premiums associated with the extinguishment of certain of our higher coupon debt

liquidity and capital resources near term view our working capital deficit  or the amount by which our current liabilities exceed our current assets  was  million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the increase in our working capital deficit was primarily caused by our use of cash to fund our tender offer for high coupon debt in the quarter ended december   which more than offset the working capital generated by our operations net of capital expenditures 
we believe that our cash on hand together with our short term investments  our currently undrawn revolver and our cash flows from operations should be sufficient to meet our cash needs through the next twelve months 
however  if we become subject to significant judgments  settlements and or tax payments  as further discussed in legal proceedings in item of this report  we could be required to make significant payments that we may not have the resources to make 
the magnitude of any settlements or judgments resulting from these actions could materially and adversely affect our ability to meet our debt obligations and our financial condition  potentially impacting our credit ratings  our ability to access capital markets and our compliance with debt covenants 
in addition  the magnitude of any settlements or judgments may cause us to draw down significantly on our cash balances  which might force us to obtain additional financing or explore other methods to generate cash 
such methods could include issuing additional securities or selling assets 
to the extent that our ebitda as defined in our debt covenants is reduced by cash judgments  settlements and or tax payments  our debt to consolidated ebitda ratios under certain debt agreements will be adversely affected 
this could reduce our liquidity and flexibility due to potential restrictions on drawing on our line of credit and potential restrictions on incurring additional debt under certain provisions of our debt agreements 

table of contents the qsc credit facility contains various limitations  including a restriction on using any proceeds from the facility to pay settlements or judgments relating to the investigation and securities actions discussed in legal proceedings in item of this report 
the wireline services segment provides over of our total operating revenue with the balance attributed to our wireless services and other services segments and the wireline services segment also provides all of the consolidated cash flows from operations 
cash flows used in operations of our wireless services segment are not expected to be significant in the near term 
cash flows used in operations of our other services segment are significant  however  we expect that the cash flows provided by the wireline services segment will be sufficient to fund these operations in the near term 
we expect that our capital expenditures will be slightly higher than our levels  with the majority being used in our wireline services segment 
during the year ended december   we completed several transactions to improve our near term financial position  including registered exchange offers  cash tender offers and consent solicitations with respect to our high coupon debt  issuances of new debt and convertible notes and debt for equity exchanges 
for a more detailed description of these activities  see note borrowings to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
in november  qcii sold billion aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due under a universal shelf registration statement filed with the sec in august due to changes in the federal securities laws effective in december  we will not issue any additional securities under that registration statement 
in december  we filed a new universal shelf registration statement  under which we may issue up to billion of securities in one or more offerings 
our ability and willingness to issue securities pursuant to this registration statement will depend on market conditions at the time of any such desired offering 
as a result of the various debt offerings  exchanges and payments in  we expect that our interest expense will decline by approximately million in long term view we have historically operated with a working capital deficit as a result of our highly leveraged position  and it is likely that we will operate with a working capital deficit in the future 
we believe that cash provided by operations and our currently undrawn revolver  combined with our current cash position and continued access to capital markets to refinance our current portion of debt  should allow us to meet our cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
we may periodically need to obtain financing in order to meet our debt obligations as they come due 
we may also need to obtain additional financing or investigate other methods to generate cash such as further cost reductions or the sale of assets if revenue and cash provided by operations decline  if economic conditions weaken  if competitive pressures increase or if we become subject to significant judgments  settlements and or tax payments as further discussed in legal proceedings in item of this report 
in the event of an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters  we could be required to make significant payments that we do not have the resources to make 
the magnitude of any settlements or judgments resulting from these actions could materially and adversely affect our ability to meet our debt obligations and our financial condition  potentially impacting our credit ratings  our ability to access capital markets and our compliance with debt covenants 
in addition  the magnitude of any settlements or judgments may cause us to draw down significantly on our cash balances  which might force us to obtain additional financing or explore other methods to generate cash 
such methods could include issuing additional securities or selling assets 
the qsc credit facility makes available to us million of additional credit subject to certain restrictions as described below  and is currently undrawn 
this facility has a cross payment default provision  and 
table of contents this facility and certain other debt issues also have cross acceleration provisions 
when present  such provisions could have a greater impact on liquidity than might otherwise arise from a default or acceleration of a single debt instrument 
these provisions generally provide that a cross default under these debt instruments could occur if we fail to pay any indebtedness when due in an aggregate principal amount greater than million  any indebtedness is accelerated in an aggregate principal amount greater than million million in the case of one of the debt instruments  or judicial proceedings are commenced to foreclose on any of our assets that secure indebtedness in an aggregate principal amount greater than million 
upon such a cross default  the creditors of a material amount of our debt may elect to declare that a default has occurred under their debt instruments and to accelerate the principal amounts due such creditors 
cross acceleration provisions are similar to cross default provisions  but permit a default in a second debt instrument to be declared only if in addition to a default occurring under the first debt instrument  the indebtedness due under the first debt instrument is actually accelerated 
in addition  the qsc credit facility contains various limitations  including a restriction on using any proceeds from the facility to pay settlements or judgments relating to the investigation and securities actions discussed in legal proceedings in item of this report 
payment obligations and contingencies payment obligations the following table summarizes our future contractual cash obligations as of december  payments due by period and thereafter total dollars in millions future contractual obligations long term debt interest on debt capital lease and other obligations operating leases subtotal purchase commitment obligations telecommunications commitments iru operating and maintenance obligations advertising and promotion services total purchase commitment obligations total future contractual obligations the table does not include our open purchase orders as of december  these purchase orders are generally at fair value  are generally cancelable without penalty and are part of normal operations  accounts payable of million  accrued expenses and other current liabilities of billion  and other long term liabilities of billion  all of which are recorded on our december  consolidated balance sheet  and any amounts related to the legal contingencies described in note commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 

table of contents interest expense in all years may differ due to future refinancing of debt 
interest on our floating rate debt was calculated for all years using the rates effective as of december  we have various long term  non cancelable purchase commitments for advertising and promotion services  including advertising and marketing at sports arenas and other venues and events 
we also have service related commitments with various vendors for data processing  technical and software support 
future payments under certain services contracts will vary depending on our actual usage 
in the table above we estimated payments for these service contracts based on the level of services we expect to receive 
in the ordinary course of business and in order to optimize our cost structure  we enter into contractual obligations to utilize network facilities from local exchange carriers with terms greater than one year 
since the contracts generally have no minimum volume requirements and are based on an interrelationship of volumes and discounted rates  we assessed our minimum commitment based on the termination fees to exit the contracts  assuming we exited the contracts on december  at december  the termination fees that would have been incurred to exit all such contracts would have been approximately million 
these termination fees are excluded from the above table as the fees would not be paid in every year and the timing of such payments  if any  is uncertain 
we believe that the payment of these fees is remote in the future under normal business conditions 
we calculated the minimum obligation for certain agreements to purchase goods or services based on termination fees that may have to be paid to exit the contract 
if we elect to exit these contracts  termination fees for all such contracts could be approximately million in these termination fees are excluded from the above table as the fees would not be paid in every year and the timing of such payments  if any  is uncertain 
we believe that the payment of these fees is remote in the future under normal business conditions 
employee benefit plans 
we offer pension  non qualified  post retirement healthcare and life insurance benefits to certain current and future retirees  some of which are due under contractual agreements 
pension and certain occupational post retirement benefits are paid through trusts and therefore are not included in this table as we are not able to reliably estimate future required contributions to the trusts  if any 
as of december   our qualified defined benefit pension plan was fully funded 
as of december   we had a liability recorded on our balance sheet of billion for non qualified pension  post retirement healthcare and life insurance and other post employment benefit obligations 
the liability is impacted by various actuarial assumptions and will differ from the sum of the future value of actuarially estimated payments 
see further discussion of our benefit plans in note employee benefits to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
off balance sheet arrangements in  we identified two relationships that may be subject to consolidation by us under the accounting guidance in fin no 
revised december  consolidation of variable interest entities  or fin r 
both relationships are with entities that provide or provided internet port access and services to their customers 
in november  we entered into a settlement agreement with one of the entities  which terminated any potential variable interests and any consolidation requirements under fin r 
we do not currently have sufficient information about the other entity to complete our analysis under fin r  even though until this entity ceased doing business we continuously requested such information 
unless further information becomes available to us about this entity  which we believe is unlikely because the entity has ceased doing business  we are unable to come to any conclusion regarding consolidation under fin r 
we previously recorded a liability and charge associated with our relationship with the second entity  and as a result  we believe that our exposure to loss  excluding interest accretion  has been reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
other than this entity and the operating leases described above  we have no special purpose or limited purpose entities that provide off balance sheet financing  liquidity  or market or credit risk support  and we do not engage in leasing  hedging  research and development services  or other relationships that expose us to liability that is not reflected on the face of the financial statements 

table of contents letters of credit we maintain letter of credit arrangements with various financial institutions for up to million 
at december   we had outstanding letters of credit of approximately million 
historical view the following table summarizes the decrease in our cash and cash equivalents for the years ended december   and years ended december  increase decrease percentage change v v v v dollars in millions cash flows provided by operating activities used for investing activities used for financing activities     nm decrease in cash and cash equivalents nm percentages greater than and comparisons between positive and negative values or to zero values are considered not meaningful 
operating activities our primary source of funds is cash generated from operating activities 
during cash from operating activities improved as income increased due to our continued efforts to reduce costs and maintain or grow revenue 
changes in operating assets and liabilities caused a use of funds in due in large part to payments made on our contracts with kmc and our second and final payment of million related to our settlement with the sec 
these uses were offset by additional improvements in working capital management from credit  collections and payment initiatives 
in  changes in operating assets and liabilities caused a source of funds largely due to a legal reserve of million and tax reserves  reduced by our first payment of million related to the above mentioned settlement with the sec 
cash provided by operating activities decreased from to as large settlement  tax and restructuring payments were offset by improvements in our working capital accounts 
investing activities cash used for investing activities decreased in primarily as a result of liquidating short term investments in order to pay down debt and reduced capital expenditure levels 
we believe that our current level of capital expenditures will sustain our business at existing levels and support our anticipated core growth requirements in areas such as high speed internet  long distance and voip products 
financing activities cash used for financing activities increased from to primarily due to debt repayments and associated early retirement of debt costs  and decreased from to primarily due to the payment of debt in with proceeds from the sale of our directory publishing business 
at december   we were in compliance with all provisions or covenants of our borrowings 
see note borrowings to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report for more information on our and historical financing activities as well as additional information regarding the covenants of our existing debt instruments 
we paid no dividends in 
table of contents credit ratings the table below summarizes our long term debt ratings at december  and december  december  moody s s p fitch moody s s p fitch corporate rating sr 
implied rating b bb nr b bb nr qwest corporation ba bb bb ba bb bb qwest communications corporation nr nr b nr nr b qwest capital funding  inc b b b caa b b qwest communications international inc b b b bb b b caa caa b b b nr not rated qcii notes have various ratings on october   s p raised its ratings on qc to bb and assigned a bb rating to the qsc credit facility 
on november   moody s raised its ratings on qwest and its affiliates as reflected in the table above 
in addition  moody s assigned a b rating to the qsc credit facility 
on november   fitch raised its ratings on qwest and its affiliates as reflected in the table above 
at the same time  fitch also assigned a bb rating to the qsc credit facility 
with respect to moody s  a ba rating is judged to have speculative elements  meaning that the future of the issuer cannot be considered to be well assured 
often the protection of interest and principal payments may be very moderate  and thereby not well safeguarded during both good and bad times 
the  modifiers show relative standing within the major categories  being the highest  or best  modifier in terms of credit quality 
with respect to s p  any rating below bbb indicates that the security is speculative in nature 
a bb rating indicates that the issuer currently has the capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation  however  it faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse business  financial or economic conditions  which could lead to the obligor s inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation 
an obligation rated b is more vulnerable to nonpayment than obligations rated bb  but the obligor currently has capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation 
adverse business  financial  or economic conditions will likely impair the obligor s capacity or willingness to meet its financial commitment on the obligation 
the plus and minus symbols show relative standing within the major categories 
with respect to fitch  any rating below bbb is considered speculative in nature 
a bb rating indicates that there is a possibility of credit risk developing  particularly as the result of adverse economic change over time  however  business or financial alternatives may be available to allow financial commitments to be met 
a b rating indicates that significant credit risk is present  but a limited margin of safety remains 
financial commitments are currently being met  however  capacity for continued payment is contingent upon a sustained  favorable business and economic environment 
the plus and minus symbols show relative standing within major categories 
debt ratings by the various rating agencies reflect each agency s opinion of the ability of the issuers to repay debt obligations as they come due 
in general  lower ratings result in higher borrowing costs and or impaired ability to borrow 
a security rating is not a recommendation to buy  sell  or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization 
given our current credit ratings  as noted above  our ability to raise additional capital under acceptable terms and conditions may be negatively impacted 
critical accounting policies and estimates we have identified the policies and estimates below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations  either past or present 
for a detailed discussion on the application of 
table of contents these and other significant accounting policies  see the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
these policies and estimates are considered critical because they either had a material impact or they have the potential to have a material impact on our financial statements  and because they require significant judgments  assumptions or estimates 
note that our preparation of this annual report on form k requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
we believe that the estimates  judgments and assumptions made when accounting for items and matters such as future usage under long term contracts  customer retention patterns  collectibility of accounts receivable  expected economic duration of assets to be depreciated or amortized  asset valuations  internal labor capitalization rates  recoverability of assets  rates of return on assets held for employee benefits  timing and amounts of future employee benefit payments  uncertain tax positions  reserves and other provisions and contingencies are reasonable  based on information available at the time they are made 
however  there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
loss contingencies and litigation reserves we are involved in several material legal proceedings  as described in more detail in legal proceedings in item of this report 
we assess potential losses in relation to these and other pending or threatened legal and tax matters 
for matters not related to income taxes  if a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  we recognize an expense for the estimated loss 
if a loss is considered possible and the amount can be reasonably estimated  we disclose it if material 
for income tax related matters  we record a liability computed at the statutory income tax rate if we determine that i we do not believe that we are more likely than not to prevail on an uncertainty related to the timing of recognition for an item  or ii we do not believe that it is probable that we will prevail and the uncertainty is not related to the timing of recognition 
the overall tax liability also considers the anticipated utilization of any applicable tax credits and net operating losses 
to the extent these estimates are more or less than the actual liability resulting from the resolution of such matters  our earnings will be increased or decreased accordingly and if the differences are material  our consolidated financial statements could be materially impacted 
revenue recognition and related reserves revenue from services is recognized when the services are provided 
up front fees received  primarily activation fees and installation charges  as well as the associated customer acquisition costs  are deferred and recognized over the expected life of the product  generally one to five years 
payments received in advance are deferred until the service is provided 
customer arrangements that include both equipment and services are evaluated to determine whether the elements are separable based on objective evidence 
if the elements are deemed separable  total consideration is allocated to each element based on the relative fair values of the separate elements and the revenue associated with each element is recognized as earned 
if the elements are not deemed separable  total consideration is deferred and recognized ratably over the longer of the contractual period or the expected customer relationship period 
we believe that the accounting estimates related to estimated lives and to the assessment of whether bundled elements are separable are critical accounting estimates because i they require management to make assumptions about how long we will retain customers  ii the assessment of whether bundled elements are separable is subjective  iii the impact of changes in actual retention periods versus these estimates on the revenue amounts reported in our consolidated statements of operations could be material  and iv the assessment of whether bundled elements are separable may result in revenue being reported in different periods than significant portions of the related costs 
as the telecommunications market experiences greater competition and customers shift from traditional land based telephony services to wireless and internet based services  our estimated customer relationship period could decrease and we will accelerate the recognition of deferred revenue and related costs over a shorter estimated customer relationship period 

table of contents restructuring and realignments periodically  we commit to exit certain business activities  eliminate office or facility locations and or reduce our number of employees 
the amount we record for such a charge depends upon various assumptions  including future severance payments  sublease income  length of time on market for abandoned rented facilities and contractual termination costs 
such estimates are inherently judgmental and may change materially based upon actual experience 
the estimate of future losses on sublease income and disposal activity generally involves the most significant judgment 
due to the estimates and judgments involved in the application of each of these accounting policies  changes in our plans and these estimates and market conditions could materially impact our financial condition or results of operations 
economic lives of assets to be depreciated or amortized due to rapid changes in technology and the competitive environment  selecting the estimated economic life of telecommunications plant  equipment and software requires a significant amount of judgment 
we regularly review data on utilization of equipment  asset retirements and salvage values to determine adjustments to our depreciation rates 
the effect of a one year increase or decrease in the estimated useful lives of our property  plant and equipment would have been decreased depreciation of approximately million or increased depreciation of approximately million  respectively 
the effect of a one year increase or decrease in the estimated useful lives of our intangible assets with finite lives would have been decreased amortization of approximately million or increased amortization of approximately million  respectively 
pension and post retirement benefits pension and post retirement healthcare and life insurance benefits attributed to employees service during the year  as well as interest on projected benefit obligations  are accrued currently 
prior service costs and credits resulting from changes in plan benefits are amortized over the average remaining service period of the employees expected to receive benefits or over the term of the collective bargaining agreement  as applicable 
pension and post retirement costs are recognized over the period in which the employee renders service and becomes eligible to receive benefits as determined using the projected unit credit method 
in computing the pension and post retirement healthcare and life insurance benefit costs  we must make numerous assumptions about such things as discount rates  expected rate of return on plan assets  employee mortality and turnover  salary and wage increases  expected future cost increases  healthcare claims experience and negotiated caps on reimbursable costs 
these items generally have the most significant impact on the level of cost the discount rate  the expected rate of return on plan assets and the terms of our post retirement plan benefits covered by collective bargaining agreements as negotiated with our employees unions 
annually  we set our discount rate primarily based upon the yields on high quality fixed income investments available at the measurement date and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension and other post retirement benefits 
in making this determination  we use a simple average of four specific indices of high quality corporate bond yields that would generate the necessary cash flows to pay our projected benefits when due 
the expected rate of return on plan assets is the long term rate of return we expect to earn on the plans assets 
the rate of return is determined by the investment composition of the plan assets and the long term risk and return forecast for each asset category 
the forecasts for each asset class are generated using historical information as well as an analysis of current and expected market conditions 
the expected risk and return characteristics for each asset class are reviewed annually and revised  as necessary  to reflect changes in the financial markets 
the estimate of the accumulated benefit obligation abo for our occupational union post retirement plan benefits is based on the terms of our written benefit plan as negotiated with our employees unions 
in making this determination we consider the exchange of benefits between us and our employees that occurs as part of the negotiations 

table of contents we have a noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plan  or the pension plan  for substantially all management and occupational union employees 
our post retirement benefit plans for certain current and future retirees include healthcare and life insurance benefits 
to compute the expected return on pension and post retirement benefit plan assets  we apply an expected rate of return to the market related asset value of the pension plan and to the fair value of post retirement plan assets 
the market related asset value is a computed value that recognizes changes in fair value of pension plan equity assets over a period of time  not to exceed five years 
the five year weighted average gains and losses related to the equity assets are added to the fair value of bonds and other assets at year end to arrive at the market related asset value 
in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  we elected to recognize actual returns on our pension plan assets ratably over a five year period when computing our market related value of pension plan assets 
this method has the effect of reducing the impact on expense from annual market volatility that may be experienced from year to year 
changes in any of the assumptions we made in computing the pension and post retirement healthcare and life insurance benefit costs could have a material impact on various components that comprise these expenses 
factors to be considered include the strength or weakness of the investment markets  changes in the composition of the employee base  fluctuations in interest rates  significant employee hiring or downsizings  medical cost trends and changes in our collective bargaining agreements 
changes in any of these factors could impact cost of sales and sg a in the consolidated statement of operations as well as the value of the asset or liability on our consolidated balance sheet 
if our assumed expected rate of return of for were basis points lower  the impact would have been to increase the pension and post retirement expense by million 
if our assumed discount rate of for were basis points lower  the impact would have been to increase the net expense by million 
if the caps on reimbursement of post retirement health costs for certain plan participants that are effective january   were not substantive  the impact would have been to increase our abo approximately billion 
the pension plan abo represents the actuarial present value of benefits based on employee service and compensation as of a certain date and does not include an assumption about future compensation levels 
if the abo exceeds plan assets and at least this amount has not been accrued  an additional minimum liability must be recognized 
annually  we evaluate the funded status of our pension plan to determine whether any additional minimum liability is required to be recognized 
recoverability of long lived assets due to our ongoing losses  we periodically perform evaluations of the recoverability of the carrying value of our long lived assets using gross undiscounted cash flow projections 
these evaluations require identification of the lowest level of identifiable  largely independent  cash flows for purposes of grouping assets and liabilities subject to review 
the cash flow projections include long term forecasts of revenue growth  gross margins and capital expenditures 
all of these items require significant judgment and assumptions 
we believe our estimates are reasonable  based on information available at the time they were made 
however  if our estimates of our future cash flows had been different  we may have concluded that some of our long lived assets were not recoverable  which would likely have caused us to record a material impairment charge 
also  if our future cash flows are significantly lower than our projections we may determine at some future date that some of our long lived assets are not recoverable 
impairments of long lived assets pursuant to the services agreement with a third party provider that allows us to resell wireless services  our wireless customers who were serviced through our proprietary wireless network were transitioned onto the third party provider s network 
due to the anticipated decrease in usage of our own wireless network following the transition of our customers onto this network  in the third quarter of we performed an evaluation of the recoverability of the carrying value of our long lived wireless network assets 

table of contents we compared gross undiscounted cash flow projections to the carrying value of the long lived wireless network assets and determined that certain asset groups were not expected to be recovered through future projected cash flows 
for those asset groups that were not recoverable  we then estimated the fair value using estimates of market prices for similar assets 
cell sites  switches  related tools and equipment inventory and certain information technology systems that support the wireless network were determined to be impaired by million 
estimating the fair value of the asset groups involved significant judgment and a variety of assumptions 
comparable market data was obtained by reviewing recent sales of similar asset types 
the price allocated to these assets in our subsequent agreement to sell the assets to verizon indicated that the ultimate proceeds from the sale of the assets differed from our estimate by an immaterial amount 
asset retirement obligations we have network assets located in leased properties such as equipment rooms  central offices  and wireless sites 
for certain of these leases  we are legally obligated to remove our equipment when the lease expires 
as required by sfas no 
 we record a liability for the estimated current fair value of the costs associated with these removal obligations 
we estimate our removal liabilities using historical cost information  industry factors  and current engineering estimates 
we then estimate the present value of these costs by discounting the future expected cash payout to current fair value based on our incremental borrowing rate 
to the extent there are material differences between our estimated and actual removal costs and our estimated and actual discount rates  we could be required to adjust our recorded liabilities at that time 
these estimates were critical factors in determining the net income impact of million upon the adoption of sfas no 
in recently adopted accounting pronouncements and cumulative effect of adoption in december  we adopted fin  which is an interpretation of sfas no 
and requires us to recognize asset retirement obligations that are conditional on a future event  such as the obligation to safely dispose of asbestos when a building is demolished or under certain circumstances  renovated 
upon adoption of fin  we determined that we have conditional asset retirement obligations to properly dispose of or encapsulate asbestos in several of our buildings and to close fuel storage tanks and dispose of other potentially hazardous materials 
we recorded a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle charge upon adoption of fin of million liability of million net of an asset of million in had fin been adopted prior to  our liabilities associated with asset retirement obligations would have increased by million both at december  and had we adopted fin prior to  our operating results for the years ending december   and would not have changed materially 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of non monetary assets  or sfas no 
 which we adopted in july prior to the adoption of sfas no 
 we were required to measure the value of certain assets exchanged in non monetary transactions by using the net book value of the asset relinquished 
under sfas no 
 we now measure assets exchanged at fair value  as long as the transaction has commercial substance and the fair value of the assets exchanged is determinable within reasonable limits 
a non monetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
the adoption of sfas no 
has not had a material effect on our financial position or results of operations for the year ended december  we adopted the provisions of fin r in the first quarter of fin r requires an evaluation of three additional criteria to determine if consolidation is required 
these criteria are i whether the entity is a variable interest entity  ii whether the company holds a variable interest in the entity  and iii whether the company is the primary beneficiary of the entity 
if all three of these criteria are met  consolidation is required 
upon adoption of fin r  we identified two relationships that may be subject to consolidation by us under the provisions of fin r 
both relationships are with groups of entities that provide internet port access and 
table of contents services to their customers 
the first relationship was with entities owned by kmc telecom holdings  inc as discussed in legal proceedings matters resolved in the fourth quarter of in item of this report  in november we entered into a settlement agreement with kmc and one of its lenders to resolve all outstanding disputes and obligations between and among us  kmc and the lender 
as a result of the settlement  we have severed our relationship with kmc in its entirety and terminated any potential variable interests and any consolidation requirements under fin r 
we previously recorded a liability and charge associated with our relationship with the second entity 
we do not currently have sufficient information about this entity to complete our analysis under fin r  even though until this entity ceased doing business we had continuously requested such information 
unless further information becomes available to us about this entity  which we believe is unlikely because the entity has ceased doing business  we are unable to come to any conclusion regarding consolidation under fin r 
as a result of previously recording a liability and charge associated with this relationship  we believe that our exposure to loss  excluding interest accretion  has been reflected in our financial statements 
in december  the medicare prescription drug  improvement  and modernization act of the medicare act became law in the united states 
the medicare act introduces a prescription drug benefit under medicare as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree healthcare benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to the medicare benefit 
we adopted the provisions of fasb staff position no 
fsp no 
 accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of accounting for the government subsidy provided under the act reduced our accumulated post retirement benefit obligation by million 
the medicare act reduced the prescription drug expense component of our and post retirement benefit expenses by million and million  respectively 
during  the center for medicare and medicaid services issued and clarified rules for implementing the medicare act 
we have revised our actuarial estimate of the federal subsidy and using our december  measurement date  the total reduction in our abo was million 
this reduction was recorded as an unrecognized actuarial gain which will be amortized to expense 
the issuance and clarification of the rules for implementing the medicare act during are expected to further reduce our prescription benefit cost in see note employee benefits to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb  as part of an effort to conform to international accounting standards  issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  or sfas no 
 which was effective for us beginning on january  sfas no 
requires that all voluntary changes in accounting principles are retrospectively applied to prior financial statements as if that principle had always been used  unless it is impracticable to do so 
when it is impracticable to calculate the effects on all prior periods  sfas no 
requires that the new principle be applied to the earliest period practicable 
currently  we do not anticipate any voluntary changes in accounting principles that  upon the adoption of sfas no 
 would have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in april  the sec delayed the effective date of sfas no 
r  share based payments  or sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r was effective for us as of the interim reporting period beginning january  sfas no 
r requires that compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
sfas no 
r covers a wide range of share based compensation arrangements including share options  restricted share plans  performance based awards  share appreciation rights and employee share purchase plans 
we do not anticipate that the adoption of sfas no 
r will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
however  depending on valuation factors such as the price of our common stock  if we grant stock based awards at similar volume to what was granted in prior years  then the application of sfas no 
r could have a material impact on our results of operations in future periods 

table of contents risk management we are exposed to market risks arising from changes in interest rates 
the objective of our interest rate risk management program is to manage the level and volatility of our interest expense 
we may employ derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk exposure 
we may also employ financial derivatives to hedge foreign currency exposures associated with particular debt 
approximately billion of floating rate debt was exposed to changes in interest rates as of december  and december  this exposure is linked to libor 
a hypothetical increase of basis points in libor would have increased annual pre tax interest expense by million in as of december  and december   we had approximately billion and billion  respectively  of long term fixed rate debt obligations maturing in the subsequent months 
we are exposed to changes in interest rates at any time that we choose to refinance this debt 
a hypothetical increase of or basis points in the interest rates on any refinancing of the current portion of long term debt would not have a material effect on our earnings 
as of december   we had million invested in money market instruments and million invested in auction rate securities 
as interest rates change  so will the interest income derived from these instruments 
assuming that these investment balances were to remain constant  a hypothetical increase of basis points in money market rates would be immaterial
