part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve inherent risks and uncertainties 
when used in this discussion  the words believes  anticipated  expects  estimates and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date hereof 
we undertake no obligation to publicly release the result of any revisions to these forward looking statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors including  but not limited to  those set forth elsewhere in this report 
please see risk factors  below  and in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this report  and the notes thereto 
we have rounded amounts reported here to the nearest thousand  unless such amounts are more than million  in which event we have rounded such amounts to the nearest hundred thousand 
general we are a defense and security products and services company  engaged in three business areas interactive simulation for military  law enforcement and commercial markets  batteries and charging systems for the military  and high level armoring for military  paramilitary and commercial vehicles 
we operate in three business units we develop  manufacture and market advanced high tech multimedia and interactive digital solutions for use of force and driving training of military  law enforcement  security and other personnel our simulation and training division  we manufacture aviation armor and we utilize sophisticated lightweight materials and advanced engineering processes to armor vehicles our armoring division  and we manufacture and sell zinc air and lithium batteries for defense and security products and other military applications and we pioneer advancements in zinc air battery technology for electric vehicles our battery and power systems division 
during  we acquired three new businesses faac corporation  located in ann arbor  michigan  which provides simulators  systems engineering and software products to the united states military  government and private industry which we have placed in our simulation and training division  epsilor electronic industries  ltd  located in dimona  israel  which develops and sells rechargeable and primary lithium batteries and smart chargers to the military and to private industry in the middle east  europe and asia which we have placed in our battery and power systems division  and armour of america  incorporated  located in los angeles  california  which manufacturers aviation armor both for helicopters and for fixed wing aircraft  marine armor  personnel armor  armoring kits for military vehicles  fragmentation blankets and a unique ballistic flotation vest armourfloat that is us coast guard certified  which we have placed in our armor division 
our financial results for do not include the activities of faac  epsilor or aoa for the full year and therefore are not directly comparable to our financial results for critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for bad debts  inventory  contingencies and warranty reserves  impairment of intangible assets and goodwill 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
under different assumptions or conditions  actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the recognition of revenue in any accounting period 
material differences in the amount of revenue in any given period may result if these judgments or estimates prove to be incorrect or if management s estimates change on the basis of development of the business or market conditions 
management judgments and estimates have been applied consistently and have been reliable historically 
a portion of our revenue is derived from license agreements that entail the customization of faac s simulators to the customer s specific requirements 
revenues from initial license fees for such arrangements are recognized in accordance with statement of position accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts based on the percentage of completion method over the period from signing of the license through to customer acceptance  as such simulators require significant modification or customization that takes time to complete 
the percentage of completion is measured by monitoring progress using records of actual time incurred to date in the project compared with the total estimated project requirement  which corresponds to the costs related to earned revenues 
estimates of total project requirements are based on prior experience of customization  delivery and acceptance of the same or similar technology and are reviewed and updated regularly by management 
we believe that the use of the percentage of completion method is appropriate as we have the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the extent of progress towards completion  contract revenues and contract costs 
in addition  contracts executed include provisions that clearly specify the enforceable rights regarding services to be provided and received by the parties to the contracts  the consideration to be exchanged and the manner and terms of settlement 
in all cases we expect to perform our contractual obligations and our licensees are expected to satisfy their obligations under the contract 
the complexity of the estimation process and the issues related to the assumptions  risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the percentage of completion method of accounting affect the amounts of revenue and related expenses reported in our consolidated financial statements 
a number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates  including labor rates  utilization and specification and testing requirement changes 
we account for our other revenues from ies simulators in accordance with the provisions of sop  software revenue recognition  issued by the american institute of certified public accountants and as amended by sop and sop and related interpretations 
we exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of software license and services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period 
we assess whether collection is probable at the time of the transaction based on a number of factors  including the customer s past transaction history and credit worthiness 
if we determine that the collection of the fee is not probable  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes probable  which is generally upon the receipt of cash 
allowance for doubtful accounts we make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for the portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful 
provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding receivables 
in determining the provision  we analyze our historical collection experience and current economic trends 
we reassess these allowances each accounting period 
historically  our actual losses and credits have been consistent with these provisions 
if actual payment experience with our customers is different than our estimates  adjustments to these allowances may be necessary resulting in additional charges to our statement of operations 
accounting for income taxes significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax expense provision 
in the ordinary course of a global business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities  the process of identifying items of revenue and expense that qualify for preferential tax treatment and segregation of foreign and domestic income and expense to avoid double taxation 
although we believe that our estimates are reasonable  the final tax outcome of these matters may be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
such differences could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income loss in the period in which such determination is made 
we have provided a valuation allowance on the majority of our net deferred tax assets  which includes federal and foreign net operating loss carryforwards  because of the uncertainty regarding their realization 
our accounting for deferred taxes under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes statement  involves the evaluation of a number of factors concerning the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
in concluding that a valuation allowance was required  we primarily considered such factors as our history of operating losses and expected future losses in certain jurisdictions and the nature of our deferred tax assets 
the company and its subsidiaries provide valuation allowances in respect of deferred tax assets resulting principally from the carryforward of tax losses 
management currently believes that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax regarding the carryforward of losses and certain accrued expenses will not be realized in the foreseeable future 
the company does not provide for us federal income taxes on the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries because such earnings are re invested and  in the opinion of management  will continue to be re invested indefinitely 
in addition  we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and may be subject to audits in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues that may require an extended period of time for resolution 
in management s opinion  adequate provisions for income taxes have been made 
inventories our policy for valuation of inventory and commitments to purchase inventory  including the determination of obsolete or excess inventory  requires us to perform a detailed assessment of inventory at each balance sheet date  which includes a review of  among other factors  an estimate of future demand for products within specific time horizons  valuation of existing inventory  as well as product lifecycle and product development plans 
the estimates of future demand that we use in the valuation of inventory are the basis for our revenue forecast  which is also used for our short term manufacturing plans 
inventory reserves are also provided to cover risks arising from slow moving items 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
we may be required to record additional inventory write down if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by our management 
for fiscal  no significant changes were made to the underlying assumptions related to estimates of inventory valuation or the methodology applied 
goodwill under financial accounting standards board statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests based on estimated fair value in accordance with sfas during  we performed an impairment test of goodwill  based on management s projections and using expected future discounted operating cash flows  as a response to several factors  including without limitation the reduced sales in aoa a component of our armor division  the fact that aoa failed to meet its projections  the decision of the general manager of aoa and his new supervisor to leave the employ of aoa and us  respectively  and general uncertainty about the market for aoa s products in general and aoa s business in particular specifically  the delay or loss of several potential orders  decisions by customers to utilize methods of armor not produced by aoa hard armor instead of soft armor  and the change in us military priorities from acquiring new armor to funding the ground forces in iraq and afghanistan 
furthermore  following hurricane katrina  the appropriation of substantial funds earmarked for defense was delayed to provide funds for hurricane relief 
as of december   as a result of this impairment test  we identified in aoa an impairment of goodwill in the amount of  in connection with our acquisition of aoa  we have a contingent earnout obligation in an amount equal to the revenues realized by us from certain specific programs that were identified by us and the former shareholder of aoa as appropriate targets for revenue increases 
the earnout provides that if aoa receives certain types of orders from certain specific customers prior to december  additional orders  then upon shipment of goods in connection with such additional orders  the former shareholder of aoa will be paid an earnout based on revenues  up to a maximum of an additional million 
to date  we have accrued a liability of  in respect of such earnout obligation 
we determine fair value using discounted cash flow analysis 
this type of analysis requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies 
it is our policy to conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and economic conditions  as well as future expectations 
in assessing the recoverability of our goodwill  we may be required to make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
this process is subjective and requires judgment at many points throughout the analysis 
if our estimates or their related assumptions change in subsequent periods or if actual cash flows are below our estimates  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
other intangible assets other intangible assets are amortized to the statement of operations over the period during which benefits are expected to accrue  currently estimated at two to ten years 
the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires us to make assumptions regarding future business conditions and operating results in order to estimate future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or the related assumptions change in the future  we could be required to record additional impairment charges 
as of december   we identified an impairment of the technology previously purchased from bristlecone and  as a result  we recorded an impairment loss in the amount of  as of december   we identified an impairment of backlog  trademarks and a covenant not to compete previously identified with respect to the aoa acquisition and  as a result  we recorded an impairment loss in the amount of  contingencies we are from time to time involved in legal proceedings and other claims 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters  as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our self insured liabilities during the past three fiscal years 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for any contingencies are made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
the required reserves may change due to future developments in each matter or changes in approach  such as a change in the settlement strategy in dealing with any contingencies  which may result in higher net loss 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments  we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material 
warranty reserves upon shipment of products to our customers  we provide for the estimated cost to repair or replace products that may be returned under warranty 
our warranty period is typically twelve months from the date of shipment to the end user customer 
for existing products  the reserve is estimated based on actual historical experience 
for new products  the warranty reserve is based on historical experience of similar products until such time as sufficient historical data has been collected on the new product 
factors that may impact our warranty costs in the future include our reliance on our contract manufacturer to provide quality products and the fact that our products are complex and may contain undetected defects  errors or failures in either the hardware or the software 
functional currency we consider the united states dollar to be the currency of the primary economic environment in which we and our israeli subsidiary efl operate and  therefore  both we and efl have adopted and are using the united states dollar as our functional currency 
transactions and balances originally denominated in us dollars are presented at the original amounts 
gains and losses arising from non dollar transactions and balances are included in net income 
the majority of financial transactions of our israeli subsidiaries mdt and epsilor is in new israel shekels nis and a substantial portion of mdt s and epsilor s costs is incurred in nis 
management believes that the nis is the functional currency of mdt and epsilor 
accordingly  the financial statements of mdt and epsilor have been translated into us dollars 
all balance sheet accounts have been translated using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
statement of operations amounts have been translated using the average exchange rate for the period 
the resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in shareholders equity 
executive summary divisions and subsidiaries we operate primarily as a holding company  through our various subsidiaries  which we have organized into three divisions 
our divisions and subsidiaries all owned  unless otherwise noted are as follows our simulation and training division  consisting of faac incorporated  located in ann arbor  michigan  which provides simulators  systems engineering and software products to the united states military  government and private industry faac  and ies interactive training  inc  located in littleton  colorado  which provides specialized use of force training for police  security personnel and the military ies 
our armor division  consisting of armour of america  located in los angeles  california  which manufacturers ballistic and fragmentation armor kits for rotary and fixed wing aircraft  marine armor  personnel armor  military vehicles and architectural applications  including both the leguard tactical leg armor and the armourfloat ballistic floatation device  which is a unique vest that is certified by the us coast guard aoa  mdt protective industries  ltd  located in lod  israel  which specializes in using state of the art lightweight ceramic materials  special ballistic glass and advanced engineering processes to fully armor vans and suvs  and is a leading supplier to the israeli military  israeli special forces and special services mdt owned  and mdt armor corporation  located in auburn  alabama  which conducts mdt s united states activities mdt armor owned 
our battery and power systems division  consisting of epsilor electronic industries  ltd  located in dimona  israel in israel s negev desert area  which develops and sells rechargeable and primary lithium batteries and smart chargers to the military and to private industry in the middle east  europe and asia epsilor  electric fuel battery corporation  located in auburn  alabama  which manufactures and sells zinc air fuel sells  batteries and chargers for the military  focusing on applications that demand high energy and light weight efb  and electric fuel efl ltd  located in beit shemesh  israel  which produces water activated lifejacket lights for commercial aviation and marine applications  and which conducts our electric vehicle effort  focusing on obtaining and implementing demonstration projects in the us and europe  and on building broad industry partnerships that can lead to eventual commercialization of our zinc air energy system for electric vehicles efl 
we are in the process of relocating the operations of ies to ann arbor  michigan adjacent to faac  and the operations of aoa to auburn  alabama adjacent to mdt armor 
overview of results of operations we incurred significant operating losses for the years ended december   and while we expect to continue to derive revenues from the sale of products that we manufacture and the services that we provide  there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability on a consistent basis 
during and  we substantially increased our revenues and reduced our net loss  from million in to million in to million in this was achieved through a combination of cost cutting measures and increased revenues  particularly from the sale of zinc air batteries to the military and from sales of products manufactured by the subsidiaries we acquired in and however  in our net loss increased to million on revenues of million 
about half of this loss was the result of impairments during of goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with our aoa subsidiary  the remainder of the increase in net loss was attributable to the factors cited below 
a portion of our operating loss during and arose as a result of non cash charges 
in addition to the charges in respect of write offs of goodwill and other intangible assets described under critical accounting policies goodwill  above  these charges were primarily related to our acquisitions  financings and issuances of restricted shares and options to employees 
because we anticipate continuing certain of these activities during  we expect to continue to incur such non cash charges in the future 
acquisitions in acquisition of subsidiaries  part of the purchase price is allocated to intangible assets and goodwill  amortization of intangible assets related to acquisition of subsidiaries is recorded based on the estimated expected life of the assets 
accordingly  for a period of time following an acquisition  we incur a non cash charge related to amortization of intangible assets in the amount of a fraction based on the useful life of the intangible assets of the amount recorded as intangible assets 
such amortization charges will continue during we are required to review intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
if we determine  through the impairment review process  that intangible asset has been impaired  we must record the impairment charge in our statement of operations 
in the case of goodwill  the assets recorded as goodwill are not amortized  instead  we are required to perform an annual impairment review 
if we determine  through the impairment review process  that goodwill has been impaired  we must record the impairment charge in our statement of operations 
as a result of the application of the above accounting rule  we incurred non cash charges for amortization of intangible assets in the amount of million during in addition  we incurred non cash charges for impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets in the amount of million during  primarily in respect of aoa 
see critical accounting policies other intangible assets  above 
financings the non cash charges that relate to our financings occurred in connection with our issuance of convertible debentures with warrants  and in connection with our repricing of certain warrants and grants of new warrants 
when we issue convertible debentures  we record a discount for a beneficial conversion feature that is amortized ratably over the life of the debenture 
when a debenture is converted  however  the entire remaining unamortized beneficial conversion feature expense is immediately recognized in the quarter in which the debenture is converted 
similarly  when we issue warrants in connection with convertible debentures  we record debt discount for financial expenses that is amortized ratably over the term of the convertible debentures  when the convertible debentures are converted  the entire remaining unamortized debt discount is immediately recognized in the quarter in which the convertible debentures are converted 
as and to the extent that our remaining convertible debentures are converted  we would incur similar non cash charges going forward 
as a result of the application of the above accounting rule  we incurred non cash charges related to amortization of debt discount attributable to beneficial conversion feature in the amount of million during issuances of restricted shares  options and warrants during and  we issued restricted shares to certain of our employees 
these shares were issued as stock bonuses  and are restricted for a period of two years from the date of issuance 
relevant accounting rules provide that the aggregate amount of the difference between the purchase price of the restricted shares in this case  generally zero and the market price of the shares on the date of grant is taken as a general and administrative expense  amortized over the life of the period of the restriction 
as a result of the application of the above accounting rules  we incurred non cash charges related to stock based compensation in the amount of  during as a result of options granted to employees  we incurred non cash charges related to stock based compensation in the amount of  during as a result of shares granted to consultants and shares granted as a donation  we incurred non cash charges related to stock based compensation in the amount of  during as part of our securities purchase agreement dated september  see note d of the notes to consolidated financial statements  we issued warrants to purchase up to  shares of common stock 
because the terms of the warrants referred to above provided that upon exercise of a warrant we could issue only stock that had been registered with the sec which occurred in december and was therefore freely tradable  in accordance with emerging issues task force no  accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock  the fair value of the warrants was recorded as a liability at the closing date 
such fair value was remeasured at each subsequent cut off date 
the fair value of these warrants was remeasured as at december  using the black scholes pricing model assuming a risk free interest rate of  a volatility factor of  dividend yields of and a contractual life of approximately one year 
the change in the fair value of the warrants between the date of the grant and december  in the amount of  has been recorded as finance income 
overview of financial condition and operating performance we shut down our money losing consumer battery operations and began acquiring new businesses in the defense and security field in thereafter  we concentrated on eliminating our operating deficit and moving arotech to positive ebitda  a goal we achieved for the first time in our history in the second half of  in part through the acquisition of businesses with strong revenues and profitable operations  however  we did not achieve such results in in our simulation and training division  revenues grew from approximately million in to million in we attribute this to the receipt by our faac subsidiary of a number of substantial orders from  for example  the united states army 
as of december   our funded backlog for our simulation and training division totaled million 
our armor division had disappointing revenues during  with revenues falling from approximately million in to million in on a pro forma basis  assuming we had owned all components of our armor division since january   revenues would have fallen from approximately million in to million in 
we attribute this to the unsatisfactory results of our mdt armor subsidiary 
as of december   our backlog for our armor division totaled million 
in our battery and power systems division  revenues fell from approximately million in to million in we attribute this to reduced equipment purchases by one of the customers of our epsilor subsidiary 
as of december   our backlog for our battery and power systems division totaled million 
results of operations preliminary note summary results of operations for the years ended december  and include the results of aoa for the period following our acquisition of aoa in august of aoa s results are therefore reflected in all of but only part of accordingly  the following year to year comparisons should not necessarily be relied upon as indications of future performance

during  we recognized revenues as follows ies and faac recognized revenues from the sale of interactive use of force and driver operator training systems and from the provision of maintenance services in connection with such systems  mdt  mdt armor and aoa recognized revenues from payments under vehicle armoring contracts  for service and repair of armored vehicles  and on sale of armoring products  efb and epsilor recognized revenues from the sale of batteries  chargers and adapters to the military  and under certain development contracts with the us army  and efl recognized revenues from the sale of lifejacket lights and from subcontracting fees received in connection with phase iv of the united states department of transportation dot electric bus program 
revenues for the year ended december  totaled million  compared to million for  a decrease of  or 
this decrease was primarily attributable to the decreased revenues of our armor division  specifically decreased revenues of mdt armor million during compared to million in 
these decreased revenues were offset to some extent by increased revenues from our simulation and training division million in compared to million in  due primarily to the increased revenues of faac 
in  revenues were as follows million for the simulation and training division  compared to million in  an increase of million  or  due primarily to the increased revenues of faac approximately million 
million for the armor division  compared to million in  a decrease of million  or  due primarily to the decreased revenues from mdt armor approximately million as a result of a slowdown in armoring orders related to the iraq war 
this decrease was partially offset by higher revenues recorded by us in from aoa in comparison to  due to the fact that aoa s revenues were included for all of but only for the last five months of on a pro forma basis  aoa s revenues decreased in versus  due to decisions by customers to utilize methods of armor not produced by aoa hard armor instead of soft armor  the change in us military priorities from acquiring new armor to funding the ground forces in iraq and afghanistan  and  following hurricane katrina  the fact that substantial funds earmarked for defense were delayed to provide funds for hurricane relief 
million for the battery and power systems division  compared to million in  a decrease of  or  due primarily to decreased sales of lithium batteries and chargers by our epsilor subsidiary as a result of reduced equipment purchases by one of its customers  offset to some extent by increased revenues from our zinc air military batteries 
cost of revenues and gross profit 
cost of revenues totaled million during  compared to million in  an increase of  or  due primarily to increased cost of goods sold related to the write off of inventory in the armor division in the amount of million in direct expenses for our three divisions during were million for the simulation and training division  compared to million in  an increase of million  or  due primarily to the addition of expenses associated with increased sales of driver training systems through faac approximately million  offset to some extent by decreased expenses associated with the sales of use of force training systems  million for the armor division  compared to million in  a decrease of million  or  due primarily to decreased revenues of mdt armor million during compared to million in  offset to some extent by increased expenses associated with aoa  including inventory write off  and million for the battery and power systems division  compared to million in  a decrease of  or  due primarily to decreased revenues from epsilor 
gross profit was million during  compared to million during  a decrease of million  or 
this decrease was the direct result of all factors presented above  most notably the decrease in revenues and margins from mdt armor and epsilor and the inventory write off in the amount of million in our armor division  offset to some extent by an increase in gross profit from our simulation and training division 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses for were million  compared to million in  a decrease of  or 
this decrease was primarily attributable to allocating research and development expenses to the cost of revenues due to research and development contracts in the battery and power systems division and due to higher capitalization of software in the amount of  in compared to sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses for were million  compared to million in  a decrease of  or 
this decrease was primarily attributable to the decrease in sales commissions in the battery and power systems division 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses for were million  compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
this increase was primarily attributable to the following factors the inclusion of the general and administrative expenses of aoa in our results for all of but only five months of  increases in general and administrative expenses in our faac subsidiary due to legal expenses  employee relocation  accounting  incentive pay accruals  and similar expenses  increase in other corporate general and administrative expenses such as auditing  legal and travel expenses  and increase in costs related to abandoned acquisition activities million 
financial expenses  net 
financial expense  net of interest income and exchange differentials  totaled approximately million in  compared to million in  a decrease of million  or 
this decrease was due primarily to the decreased amortization of compensation related to warrants issued to the holders of convertible debentures and related beneficial conversion feature 
income taxes 
we and certain of our subsidiaries incurred net operating losses during and  accordingly  we were not required to make any provision for income taxes 
with respect to some of our subsidiaries that operated at a net profit during  we were able to offset federal taxes against our net operating loss carry forwards 
we recorded a total of  in tax expenses in  with respect to certain of our subsidiaries that operated at a net profit during and we are not able to offset their taxes against our net operating loss carry forwards and with respect to state taxes 
we recorded a total of  in tax expenses in  with respect to certain of our subsidiaries that operated at a net profit during and we were not able to offset their taxes against our net operating loss carry forwards and with respect to state taxes 
amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets totaled million in  compared to million in  an increase of  or  due primarily to amortization of intangible assets related to our aoa subsidiary that we acquired in august impairment of goodwill and other intangibles assets 
current accounting standards require us to test goodwill for impairment at least annually  and between annual tests in certain circumstances  when we determine goodwill is impaired  it must be written down  rather than being amortized as previous accounting standards required 
goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of our reportable units with their carrying value 
fair value is determined using discounted cash flows 
significant estimates used in the methodologies include estimates of future cash flows  future short term and long term growth rates  weighted average cost of capital and estimates of market multiples for the reportable units 
during  we performed an impairment test of goodwill  based on management s projections and using expected future discounted operating cash flows  as a response to several factors  including without limitation the reduced sales in aoa a component of our armor division  the fact that aoa failed to meet its projections  the decision of the general manager of aoa and his new supervisor to leave the employ of aoa us  respectively  and general uncertainty about the market for aoa s products in general and aoa s business in particular specifically  the delay or loss of several potential orders  decisions by customers to utilize methods of armor not produced by aoa hard armor instead of soft armor  and the change in us military priorities from acquiring new armor to funding the ground forces in iraq and afghanistan 
furthermore  following hurricane katrina  substantial funds earmarked for defense were delayed to provide funds for hurricane relief 
as of december   as a result of this impairment test  we identified in aoa an impairment of goodwill in the amount of million 
our and our subsidiaries long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles are reviewed for impairment in accordance with current accounting standards whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of the carrying amount of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the assets 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
as of december   we identified an impairment of the technology previously purchased from bristlecone and  as a result  we recorded an impairment loss in the amount of  as of december   we identified an impairment of backlog  trademarks and a covenant not to compete previously identified with respect to the aoa acquisition and  as a result  we recorded an impairment loss in the amount of  loss from continuing operations 
due to the factors cited above  we reported a loss from continuing operations of million in  compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
loss from discontinued operations 
net loss from discontinued operations for was  compared to in this is because during the second quarter of we took an accrual of  for a litigation contingency related to the discontinued operations  in march  this litigation was settled for  net loss before deemed dividend of common stock to certain stockholders 
due to the factors cited above  we reported a net loss of million in  compared to a net loss of million in  an increase of million  or 
net loss after deemed dividend of common stock to certain stockholders

we used available funds in primarily for sales and marketing  continued research and development expenditures  expenses in connection with acquisitions and proposed acquisitions  and other working capital needs 
we increased our investment in fixed assets by million during the year ended december   primarily in the battery and power systems division and in the simulation and training division 
our net fixed assets amounted to million as at year end 
net cash used in operating activities for and was million and  respectively  an increase of million 
this increase was primarily the result of increased loss in and an increase in trade receivables and decrease in trade payables and other account payables 
net cash used in investing activities for and was million and million  respectively  a decrease of million 
this decrease was primarily the result of our investment in the acquisition of faac  epsilor and aoa in net cash provided by financing activities for and was million and million  respectively  a decrease of million 
this decrease was primarily the result of lower amounts of funds raised through sales of our securities in compared to during  certain of our employees exercised options under our registered employee stock option plan 
the proceeds to us from the exercised options were approximately  we have approximately million in long term debt outstanding not including accrued severance pay 
all of this debt was convertible debt  the unamortized financial expenses related to the beneficial conversion feature of this convertible debt amounted to approximately  at year end 
we also have approximately million in short term debt not including trade payables and other accounts payable  of which  relates to the earn out provision in connection with our acquisition of faac and million relates to short term convertible debt 
our debt agreements contain customary affirmative and negative operations covenants that limit the discretion of our management with respect to certain business matters and place restrictions on us  including obligations on our part to preserve and maintain our assets and restrictions on our ability to incur or guarantee debt  to merge with or sell our assets to another company  and to make significant capital expenditures without the consent of the debenture holders  as well as granting to our investors a right of first refusal on any future financings  except for underwritten public offerings in excess of million 
we do not believe that this right of first refusal will materially limit our ability to undertake future financings 
based on our internal forecasts  we believe that our present cash position  anticipated cash flows from operations  lines of credit and anticipated additions to paid in capital should be sufficient to satisfy our current estimated cash requirements through the next twelve months 
this belief is based on certain earnout and other assumptions that our management and our subsidiaries managers believe to be reasonable  some of which are subject to the risk factors detailed under item a 
risk factors  above  including without limitation i that we will be able to refinance  restructure or convert to equity our million in convertible debt debentures and notes that is due in which does not include million short term bank credit  ii that our dispute with the former shareholders of faac will ultimately be decided substantially in our favor  iii that the severance and retirement benefits that we owe to certain of our senior executives will not have to be paid ahead of their anticipated schedule  and iv that no other earnout payments to the former shareholder of aoa will be required in excess of the funds being held by him in escrow to secure such earnout obligations 
in this connection  we note that we can require the holder of our notes to convert a portion of their notes into shares of our common stock at the time principal payments are due only if such shares are registered for resale and certain other conditions are met 
based on the current price of our stock  we do not have a sufficient number of shares of our stock registered for resale in order to continue requiring the holders to convert a portion of their notes past a portion of the payment due may  we would accordingly have to file a registration statement with the sec to register for resale more shares of our common stock in order to continue requiring conversion of our notes upon principal payment becoming due 
any delay in the registration process  including through routine sec review of our registration statement or other filings with the sec  could result in our having to pay scheduled principal repayments on our notes in cash  which would negatively impact our cash position and  if we do not have sufficient cash to make such payments in cash  could cause us to default on our notes 
we also note that from time to time our working capital needs are partially dependent on our subsidiaries lines of credit 
in the event that we are unable to continue to make use of our subsidiaries lines of credit for working capital on economically feasible terms  our business  operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 
effective corporate tax rate we and certain of our subsidiaries incurred net operating losses during the years ended december   and  and accordingly no provision for income taxes was required
