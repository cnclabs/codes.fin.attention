item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financing activities 
property expansions several of our properties have available land for expanding the number of sites available to be utilized by our customers 
development of these sites expansion sites is predicated upon local market conditions and zoning and other applicable laws 
when justified  development of expansion sites allows us to leverage existing facilities and amenities to increase the income generated from the properties 
where appropriate  facilities and amenities may be upgraded or added to certain properties to make those properties more attractive in their markets 
our acquisition philosophy has included the desire to own properties with potential expansion site development 
approximately of our properties have expansion potential  including  acres available for expansion at our thousand trails properties 
leases or usage rights at our properties  a typical lease entered into between the owner of a home and the company for the rental of a site is for a month to month or year to year term  renewable upon the consent of both parties or  in some instances  as provided by statute 
these leases are cancelable  depending on applicable law  for non payment of rent  violation of property rules and regulations or other specified defaults 
non cancelable long term leases  with remaining terms ranging up to ten years  are in effect at certain sites within of the properties 
some of these leases are subject to rental rate increases based on the consumer price index cpi  in some instances taking into consideration certain floors and ceilings and allowing for pass throughs of certain items such as real estate taxes  utility expenses and capital expenditures 
generally  market rate adjustments are made on an annual basis 
at resort oriented properties  long term customers typically enter into right to use agreements and many typically prepay for their stay 
many resort customers will also leave deposits to reserve a site for the following year 
generally these customers cannot live full time on the property 
regulations and insurance general 
our properties are subject to various laws  ordinances and regulations  including regulations relating to recreational facilities such as swimming pools  clubhouses and other common areas 
we believe that each property has the necessary permits and approvals to operate 
rent control legislation 
at certain of our properties  state and local rent control laws  principally in california  limit our ability to increase rents and to recover increases in operating expenses and the costs of capital improvements 
enactment of such laws has been considered from time to time in other jurisdictions 
we presently expect to continue to maintain properties  and may purchase additional properties  in markets that are either subject to rent control or in which rent limiting legislation exists or may be enacted 
for example  florida has enacted a law that generally provides that rental increases must be reasonable 
also  certain jurisdictions in california in which we own properties limit rent increases to changes in the cpi or some percentage thereof 
as part of our effort to realize the value of our properties subject to restrictive regulation  we have initiated lawsuits against several municipalities imposing such regulation in an attempt to balance the interests of our stockholders with the interests of our customers see item legal proceedings 
insurance 
we believe that the properties are covered by adequate fire  flood  property  earthquake and business interruption insurance where appropriate provided by reputable companies and with commercially reasonable deductibles and limits 
due to the lack of available commercially reasonable coverage  we are self insured for terrorism incidents at substantially all of our properties 
we believe our insurance coverage is adequate based on our assessment of the risks to be insured  the probability of loss and the relative cost of available coverage 
we have obtained insurance insuring good title to the properties in an aggregate amount that we believe to be adequate 
approximately florida properties suffered damage from the four hurricanes that struck the state during august and september as of february   approximately million of claims  including business interruption  have been submitted to our insurance companies for reimbursement 
as of december   we made total expenditures of approximately million and expect to incur additional expenditures to complete the work necessary to restore our properties to their pre hurricanes condition 
we received proceeds from insurance carriers of approximately million as of december  we have reserved approximately million related to these expenditures million in and million in 
approximately million of these expenditures have been capitalized per our capitalization policy as of december  approximately million is included in other assets as a receivable from insurance providers as of december   and approximately million was included in other assets as of december  in  we reduced the book value of our assets by approximately million due to damage caused by the storms 
we received insurance proceeds of approximately million relating to other matters 
both of these items were recorded in income from other investments  net 
during the fourth quarter of we spent approximately million on properties located in south florida impacted by hurricane wilma to get them operationally ready for the season 
this amount has been charged to operations in we are still evaluating the total costs we expect to incur and are preparing our insurance claim 
industry we believe that modern properties similar to ours provide an opportunity for increased cash flows and appreciation in value 
these may be achieved through increases in occupancy rates and rents  as well as expense controls  expansion of existing properties and opportunistic acquisitions  for the following reasons barriers to entry we believe that the supply of new properties in locations targeted by the company will be constrained due to barriers to entry 
the most significant barrier has been the difficulty of securing zoning from local authorities 
this has been the result of i the public s historically poor perception of manufactured housing  and ii the fact that properties generate less tax revenue because the homes are treated as personal property a benefit to the homeowner rather than real property 
another factor that creates substantial barriers to entry is the length of time between investment in a property s development and the attainment of stabilized occupancy and the generation of revenues 
the initial development of the infrastructure may take up to two or three years 
once a property is ready for occupancy  it may be difficult to attract customers to an empty property 
substantial occupancy levels may take several years to achieve 
industry consolidation according to various industry reports  there are approximately  properties in the united states  and approximately or approximately  of the properties have more than sites and would be considered investment grade 
we believe that this relatively high degree of fragmentation provides us  as a national organization with experienced management and substantial financial resources  the opportunity to purchase additional properties 
customer base we believe that properties tend to achieve and maintain a stable rate of occupancy due to the following factors i customers typically own their own homes  ii properties tend to foster a sense of community as a result of amenities such as clubhouses and recreational and social activities  iii since moving a site set home from one property to another involves substantial cost and effort  customers often sell their home in place similar to site built residential housing with no interruption of rental payments to us 
lifestyle choice according to the recreational vehicle industry association  nearly in us vehicle owning households owns an rv 
the million people born from to or baby boomers make up the fastest growing segment of this market 
everyday  americans turn according to us census figures 
we believe that this population segment  seeking an active lifestyle  will provide opportunities for future cash flow growth for the company 
current rv owners  once finished with the more active rv lifestyle  will often seek more permanent retirement or vacation establishments 
the site set housing choice has become an increasingly popular housing alternative for retirement  second home  and empty nest living 
according to a fannie mae survey  the baby boom generation will constitute of the us population within the next years and more than million people will reach age within the next ten years 
among those individuals who are nearing retirement age to  approximately plan on moving upon retirement 
we believe that the housing choices in our properties are especially attractive to such individuals throughout this lifestyle cycle 
our properties offer an appealing amenity package  close proximity to local services  social activities  low maintenance and a secure environment 
in fact  many of our properties allow for this cycle to occur within a single property 
construction quality since  all factory built housing has been required to meet stringent federal standards  resulting in significant increases in quality 
the department of housing and urban development s hud standards for site set housing construction quality are the only federally regulated standards governing housing quality of any type in the united states 
site set homes produced since have received a red and silver government seal certifying that they were built in compliance with the federal code 
the code regulates site set home design and construction  strength and durability  fire resistance and energy efficiency  and the installation and performance of heating  plumbing  air conditioning  thermal and electrical systems 
in newer homes  top grade lumber and dry wall materials are common 
also  manufacturers are required to follow the same fire codes as builders of site built structures 
in addition  although resort cottages do not come under the same regulation  many of the manufacturers of site set homes also produce resort cottages with many of the same quality standards 
comparability to site built homes the site set housing industry has experienced a trend towards multi section homes 
many modern site set homes are longer up to feet  compared to feet in the s and wider than earlier models 
many such homes have nine foot ceilings or vaulted ceilings  fireplaces and as many as four bedrooms  and closely resemble single family ranch style site built homes 
second home demographics according to the national association of realtors nar report  sales of second homes in rose from to a total of million units 
of the million second home units sold in  million were vacation home sales  a increase from the previous year 
there were approximately million vacation homes owned in the typical vacation home buyer is years old and earned  in approximately of vacation home owners prefer to be near an ocean  river or lake  close to mountains or other natural attractions  and in a specific vacation area 
in looking ahead  nar believes that baby boomers are still in their peak earning years  and the leading edge of their generation is approaching retirement 
as they continue to have the financial wherewithal to purchase second homes as a vacation property  investment opportunity  or perhaps as a retirement retreat  those baby boomers will continue to drive the market for second homes 
it is likely that over the next decade we will continue to see historically high levels of second home sales

risk factors our performance and common stock value are subject to risks associated with the real estate industry 
adverse economic conditions and other factors could adversely affect the value of our properties and our cash flow 
several factors may adversely affect the economic performance and value of our properties 
these factors include changes in the national  regional and local economic climate  local conditions such as an oversupply of lifestyle oriented properties or a reduction in demand for lifestyle oriented properties in the area  the attractiveness of our properties to customers  competition from manufactured home communities and other lifestyle oriented properties and alternative forms of housing such as apartment buildings and site built single family homes  our ability to collect rent from customers and pay maintenance  insurance and other operating costs including real estate taxes  which could increase over time  the failure of our assets to generate income sufficient to pay our expenses  service our debt and maintain our properties  which may adversely affect our ability to make expected distributions to our stockholders  our inability to meet mortgage payments on any property that is mortgaged  in which case the lender could foreclose on the mortgage and take the property  interest rate levels and the availability of financing  which may adversely affect our financial condition  and changes in laws and governmental regulations including rent control laws and regulations governing usage  zoning and taxes  which may adversely affect our financial condition 
new acquisitions may fail to perform as expected and competition for acquisitions may result in increased prices for properties 
we intend to continue to acquire properties 
newly acquired properties may fail to perform as expected 
we may underestimate the costs necessary to bring an acquired property up to standards established for its intended market position 
difficulties in integrating acquisitions may prove costly or time consuming and could divert management attention 
additionally  we expect that other real estate investors with significant capital will compete with us for attractive investment opportunities 
these competitors include publicly traded reits  private reits and other types of investors 
such competition increases prices for properties 
we expect to acquire properties with cash from secured or unsecured financings  proceeds from offerings of equity or debt  undistributed funds from operations and sales of investments 
we may not be in a position or have the opportunity in the future to make suitable property acquisitions on favorable terms 
because real estate investments are illiquid  we may not be able to sell properties when appropriate 
real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly 
we may not be able to vary our portfolio promptly in response to economic or other conditions  forcing us to accept lower than market value 
this inability to respond promptly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to service debt and make distributions to our stockholders 
some potential losses are not covered by insurance 
we carry comprehensive liability  fire  extended coverage and rental loss insurance on all of our properties 
we believe the policy specifications and insured limits of these policies are adequate and appropriate 
there are  however  certain types of losses  such as lease and other contract claims  that generally are not insured 
should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur  we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property  as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property 
in such an event  we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property 
debt financing  financial covenants and degree of leverage could adversely affect our economic performance 
scheduled debt payments could adversely affect our financial condition 
our business is subject to risks normally associated with debt financing 
the total principal amount of our outstanding indebtedness was approximately billion as of december  our substantial indebtedness and the cash flow associated with serving our indebtedness could have important consequences  including the risks that our cash flow could be insufficient to pay distributions at expected levels and meet required payments of principal and interest  we will be required to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay our indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund the implementation of our business strategy  acquisitions  capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes  our debt service obligations could limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  we may not be able to refinance existing indebtedness which in virtually all cases requires substantial principal payments at maturity and  if we can  the terms of such refinancing might not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness  if principal payments due at maturity cannot be refinanced  extended or paid with proceeds of other capital transactions  such as new equity capital  our cash flow will not be sufficient in all years to repay all maturing debt  and if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing such as the possible reluctance of lenders to make commercial real estate loans result in higher interest rates  increased interest expense would adversely affect cash flow and our ability to service debt and make distributions to stockholders 
financial covenants could adversely affect our financial condition 
if a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and we are unable to meet mortgage payments  the mortgagee could foreclose on the property  resulting in loss of income and asset value 
the mortgages on our properties contain customary negative covenants which  among other things  limit our ability  without the prior consent of the lender  to further mortgage the property and to discontinue insurance coverage 
in addition  our credit facilities contain certain customary restrictions  requirements and other limitations on our ability to incur indebtedness  including total debt to assets ratios  debt service coverage ratios and minimum ratios of unencumbered assets to unsecured debt 
foreclosure on mortgaged properties or an inability to refinance existing indebtedness would likely have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
our degree of leverage could limit our ability to obtain additional financing 
our debt to market capitalization ratio total debt as a percentage of total debt plus the market value of the outstanding common stock and units held by parties other than the company is approximately as of december  the degree of leverage could have important consequences to stockholders  including an adverse effect on our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  development or other general corporate purposes  and makes us more vulnerable to a downturn in business or the economy generally 
we depend on our subsidiaries dividends and distributions 
substantially all of our assets are indirectly held through the operating partnership 
as a result  we have no source of operating cash flow other than from distributions from the operating partnership 
our ability to pay dividends to holders of common stock depends on the operating partnership s ability first to satisfy its obligations to its creditors and make distributions payable to third party holders of its preferred units and then to make distributions to mhc trust and common unit holders 
similarly  mhc trust must satisfy its obligations to its creditors and preferred shareholders before making common stock distributions to us 
stockholders ability to effect changes of control of the company is limited 
provisions of our charter and bylaws could inhibit changes of control 
certain provisions of our charter and bylaws may delay or prevent a change of control of the company or other transactions that could provide our stockholders with a premium over the then prevailing market price of their common stock or which might otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders 
these include the ownership limit described below 
also  any future series of preferred stock may have certain voting provisions that could delay or prevent a change of control or other transaction that might involve a premium price or otherwise be good for our stockholders 
maryland law imposes certain limitations on changes of control 
certain provisions of maryland law prohibit business combinations including certain issuances of equity securities with any person who beneficially owns ten percent or more of the voting power of outstanding common stock  or with an affiliate of the company who  at any time within the two year period prior to the date in question  was the owner of ten percent or more of the voting power of the outstanding voting stock an interested stockholder  or with an affiliate of an interested stockholder 
these prohibitions last for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder became an interested stockholder 
after the five year period  a business combination with an interested stockholder must be approved by two super majority stockholder votes unless  among other conditions  our common stockholders receive a minimum price for their shares and the consideration is received in cash or in the same form as previously paid by the interested stockholder for its shares of common stock 
the board of directors has exempted from these provisions under the maryland law any business combination with samuel zell  who is the chairman of the board of the company  certain holders of units who received them at the time of our initial public offering  the general motors hourly rate employees pension trust and the general motors salaried employees pension trust  and our officers who acquired common stock at the time we were formed and each and every affiliate of theirs 
we have a stock ownership limit for reit tax purposes 
to remain qualified as a reit for us federal income tax purposes  not more than in value of our outstanding shares of capital stock may be owned  directly or indirectly  by five or fewer individuals as defined in the federal income tax laws applicable to reits at any time during the last half of any taxable year 
to facilitate maintenance of our reit qualification  our charter  subject to certain exceptions  prohibits beneficial ownership as defined in our charter by any single stockholder of more than in value or number of shares  whichever is more restrictive of our outstanding capital stock 
we refer to this as the ownership limit 
within certain limits  our charter permits the board of directors to increase the ownership limit with respect to any class or series of stock 
the board of directors  upon receipt of a ruling from the irs  opinion of counsel  or other evidence satisfactory to the board of directors and upon fifteen days prior written notice of a proposed transfer which  if consummated  would result in the transferee owning shares in excess of the ownership limit  and upon such other conditions as the board of directors may direct  may exempt a stockholder from the ownership limit 
absent any such exemption  capital stock acquired or held in violation of the ownership limit will be transferred by operation of law to us as trustee for the benefit of the person to whom such capital stock is ultimately transferred  and the stockholder s rights to distributions and to vote would terminate 
such stockholder would be entitled to receive  from the proceeds of any subsequent sale of the capital stock transferred to us as trustee  the lesser of i the price paid for the capital stock or  if the owner did not pay for the capital stock for example  in the case of a gift  devise of other such transaction  the market price of the capital stock on the date of the event causing the capital stock to be transferred to us as trustee or ii the amount realized from such sale 
a transfer of capital stock may be void if it causes a person to violate the ownership limit 
the ownership limit could delay or prevent a change in control of the company and  therefore  could adversely affect our stockholders ability to realize a premium over the then prevailing market price for their common stock 
conflicts of interest could influence the company s decisions 
certain stockholders could exercise influence in a manner inconsistent with the stockholders best interests 
as of december   mr 
zell and certain affiliated holders beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding common stock in each case including common stock issuable upon the exercise of stock options and the exchange of units 
accordingly  mr 
zell has significant influence on our management and operation 
such influence could be exercised in a manner that is inconsistent with the interests of other stockholders 
mr 
zell and his affiliates continue to be involved in other investment activities 
mr 
zell and his affiliates have a broad and varied range of investment interests  including interests in other real estate investment companies involved in other forms of housing  including multifamily housing 
mr 
zell and his affiliates may acquire interests in other companies 
mr 
zell may not be able to control whether any such company competes with the company 
consequently  mr 
zell s continued involvement in other investment activities could result in competition to the company as well as management decisions which might not reflect the interests of our stockholders 
risk of eminent domain and tenant litigation 
we own properties in certain areas of the country where real estate values have increased faster than rental rates in our properties either because of locally imposed rent control or long term leases 
in such areas  we have learned that certain local government entities have investigated the possibility of seeking to take our properties by eminent domain at values below the value of the underlying land 
while no such eminent domain proceeding has been commenced  and we would exercise all of our rights in connection with any such proceeding  successful condemnation proceedings by municipalities could adversely affect our financial condition 
moreover  certain of our properties located in california are subject to rent control ordinances  some of which not only severely restrict ongoing rent increases but also prohibit us from increasing rents upon turnover 
such regulation allows customers to sell their homes for a premium representing the value of the future discounted rent controlled rents 
as part of our effort to realize the value of our properties subject to rent control  we have initiated lawsuits against several municipalities in california 
in response to our efforts  tenant groups have filed lawsuits against us seeking not only to limit rent increases  but to be awarded large damage awards 
if we are unsuccessful in our efforts to challenge rent control ordinances  it is likely that we will not be able to charge rents that reflect the intrinsic value of the affected properties 
finally  tenant groups in non rent controlled markets have also attempted to use litigation as a means of protecting themselves from rent increases reflecting the rental value of the affected properties 
an unfavorable outcome in the tenant group lawsuits could have an adverse impact on our financial condition 
environmental problems are possible and can be costly 
federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may require a current or previous owner or operator of real estate to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at such property 
the owner or operator may have to pay a governmental entity or third parties for property damage and for investigation and clean up costs incurred by such parties in connection with the contamination 
such laws typically impose clean up responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants 
even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination  each person covered by the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the clean up costs incurred 
in addition  third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from that site 
environmental laws also govern the presence  maintenance and removal of asbestos 
such laws require that owners or operators of property containing asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos  that they notify and train those who may come into contact with asbestos and that they undertake special precautions  including removal or other abatement  if asbestos would be disturbed during renovation or demolition of a building 
such laws may impose fines and penalties on real property owners or operators who fail to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos fibers 
we have a significant concentration of properties in florida and california  and natural disasters or other catastrophic events in these or other states could adversely affect the value of our properties and our cash flow 
as of december   we owned or had an ownership interest in properties located in states and british columbia  including properties located in florida and properties located in california 
the occurrence of a natural disaster or other catastrophic event in any of these areas may cause a sudden decrease in the value of our properties 
while we have obtained insurance policies providing certain coverage against damage from fire  flood  property damage  earthquake  wind storm and business interruption  these insurance policies contain coverage limits  limits on covered property and various deductible amounts that the company must pay before insurance proceeds are available 
such insurance may therefore be insufficient to restore our economic position with respect to damage or destruction to our properties caused by such occurrences 
moreover  each of these coverages must be renewed every year and there is the possibility that all or some of the coverages may not be available at a reasonable cost 
in addition  in the event of such natural disaster or other catastrophic event  the process of obtaining reimbursement for covered losses  including the lag between expenditures incurred by us and reimbursements received from the insurance providers  could adversely affect our economic performance 
market interest rates may have an effect on the value of our common stock 
one of the factors that investors consider important in deciding whether to buy or sell shares of a reit is the distribution rates with respect to such shares as a percentage of the price of such shares relative to market interest rates 
if market interest rates go up  prospective purchasers of reit shares may expect a higher distribution rate 
higher interest rates would not  however  result in more funds for us to distribute and  in fact  would likely increase our borrowing costs and potentially decrease funds available for distribution 
thus  higher market interest rates could cause the market price of our publicly traded securities to go down 
we are dependent on external sources of capital 
to qualify as a reit  we must distribute to our stockholders each year at least of our reit taxable income determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding any net capital gain 
in addition  we intend to distribute all or substantially all of our net income so that we will generally not be subject to us federal income tax on our earnings 
because of these distribution requirements  it is not likely that we will be able to fund all future capital needs  including for acquisitions  from income from operations 
we therefore will have to rely on third party sources of debt and equity capital financing  which may or may not be available on favorable terms or at all 
our access to third party sources of capital depends on a number of things  including conditions in the capital markets generally and the market s perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings 
moreover  additional equity offerings may result in substantial dilution of stockholders interests  and additional debt financing may substantially increase our leverage 
our qualification as a reit is dependent on compliance with us federal income tax requirements 
we believe we have been organized and operated in a manner so as to qualify for taxation as a reit  and we intend to continue to operate so as to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes 
qualification as a reit for us federal income tax purposes  however  is governed by highly technical and complex provisions of the code for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations 
our qualification as a reit requires analysis of various facts and circumstances that may not be entirely within our control  and we cannot provide any assurance that the internal revenue service the irs will agree with our analysis 
these matters can affect our qualification as a reit 
in addition  legislation  new regulations  administrative interpretations or court decisions might significantly change the tax laws with respect to the requirements for qualification as a reit or the us federal income tax consequences of qualification as a reit 
if  with respect to any taxable year  we fail to maintain our qualification as a reit and specified relief provisions under the code were not applicable to such disqualification  we could not deduct distributions to stockholders in computing our net taxable income and we would be subject to us federal income tax on our net taxable income at regular corporate rates 
any us federal income tax payable could include applicable alternative minimum tax 
if we had to pay us federal income tax  the amount of money available to distribute to stockholders and pay indebtedness would be reduced for the year or years involved  and we would no longer be required to distribute money to stockholders 
in addition  we would also be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost  unless we were entitled to relief under the relevant statutory provisions 
although we currently intend to operate in a manner designed to allow us to qualify as a reit  future economic  market  legal  tax or other considerations may cause us to revoke the reit election

many also offer additional amenities such as sauna whirlpool spas  golf courses  tennis  shuffleboard and basketball courts  exercise rooms and various social activities such as concerts

property portfolio as of december   we owned or had an ownership interest in a portfolio of properties located throughout the united states and british columbia containing  residential sites 
the distribution of our properties throughout the united states reflects our belief that geographic diversification helps insulate the portfolio from regional economic influences

item legal proceedings california rent control litigation as part of the company s effort to realize the value of its properties subject to rent control  the company has initiated lawsuits against several municipalities in california 
the company s goal is to achieve a level of regulatory fairness in california s rent control jurisdictions  and in particular those jurisdictions that prohibit increasing rents to market upon turnover 
regulations in california allow tenants to sell their homes for a premium representing the value of the future discounted rent controlled rents 
in the company s view  such regulation results in a transfer of the value of the company s stockholders land  which would otherwise be reflected in market rents  to tenants upon the sales of their homes in the form of an inflated purchase price that cannot be attributed to the value of the home being sold 
as a result  in the company s view  the company loses the value of its asset and the selling tenant leaves the property with a windfall premium 
the company has discovered through the litigation process that certain municipalities considered condemning the company s properties at values well below the value of the underlying land 
in the company s view  a failure to articulate market rents for sites governed by restrictive rent control would put the company at risk for condemnation or eminent domain proceedings based on artificially reduced rents 
such a physical taking  should it occur  could represent substantial lost value to stockholders 
the company is cognizant of the need for affordable housing in the jurisdictions  but asserts that restrictive rent regulation does not promote this purpose because the benefits of such regulation are fully capitalized into the prices of the homes sold 
the company estimates that the annual rent subsidy to tenants in these jurisdictions may be in excess of million 
in a more well balanced regulatory environment  the company would receive market rents that would eliminate the subsidy and homes would trade at or near their intrinsic value 
in connection with such efforts  the company announced it has entered into a settlement agreement with the city of santa cruz  california and that  pursuant to the settlement agreement  the city amended its rent control ordinance to exempt the company s property from rent control as long as the company offers a long term lease which gives the company the ability to increase rents to market upon turnover and bases annual rent increases on the cpi 
the settlement agreement benefits the company s stockholders by allowing them to receive the value of their investment in this property through vacancy decontrol while preserving annual cpi based rent increases in this age restricted property 
the company has filed two lawsuits in federal court against the city of san rafael  challenging its rent control ordinance on constitutional grounds 
the company believes that one of those lawsuits was settled by the city agreeing to amend the ordinance to permit adjustments to market rent upon turnover 
the city subsequently rejected the settlement agreement 
the court initially found the settlement agreement was binding on the city  but then reconsidered and determined to submit the claim of breach of the settlement agreement to a jury 
in october  the first case against the city went to trial  based on both breach of the settlement agreement and the constitutional claims 
a jury found no breach of the settlement agreement  the company then filed motions asking the court to rule in its favor on that claim  notwithstanding the jury verdict 
the court postponed decision on those motions and on the constitutional claims  pending a ruling on some property rights issues by the united states supreme court 
in the event that the court does not rule in favor of the company on either the settlement agreement or the constitutional claims  then the company has pending claims seeking a declaration that it can close the property and convert it to another use 
the united states supreme court issued the property rights rulings in and the company awaits the court s decisions in the san rafael matters 
on january   the court issued a ruling that granted the company s motion for leave to amend to assert alternative takings theories in light of the united states supreme court s decisions 
the court s ruling also denied the company s post trial motions related to the settlement agreement and dismissed the park closure claim without prejudice to the company s ability to reassert such claim in the future 
as a result  the company has filed a new complaint challenging the city s ordinance as violating the takings clause and substantive due process 
the company expects the city to file a responsive motion to the amended complaint and for further legal proceedings to occur in the company s efforts to achieve a balanced regulatory environment incentivize tenant groups to file lawsuits against the company seeking large damage awards 
the homeowners association at contempo marin cmhoa  a site property in san rafael  california  sued the company in december over a prior settlement agreement on a capital expenditure pass through after the company sued the city of san rafael in october alleging its rent control ordinance is unconstitutional 
in the contempo marin case  the cmhoa prevailed on a motion for summary judgment on an issue that permits the company to collect only out of a monthly pass through amount of that the company believes had been agreed to by the cmhoa in a settlement agreement 
on may   the california court of appeal affirmed the trial court s order dismissing the company s claims against the city of san rafael 
the cmhoa continues to seek damages from the company in this matter 
the company has reached a tentative settlement with the cmhoa in this matter which allows the company to recover of the requested monthly pass through and does not provide for the payment of any damages to the cmhoa 
both the cmhoa and the company will bring motions for their respective attorneys fees following the settlement becoming final 
the company intends to vigorously defend this matter should the settlement not become final 
the company believes that such lawsuits will be a consequence of the company s efforts to change rent control since tenant groups actively desire to preserve the premium value of their homes in addition to the discounted rents provided by rent control 
the company has determined that its efforts to rebalance the regulatory environment despite the risk of litigation from tenant groups are necessary not only because of the million annual subsidy to tenants  but also because of the condemnation risk 
similarly  in june  the company won a judgment against the city of santee in california superior court case no 

the effect of the judgment was to invalidate  on state law grounds  two rent control ordinances the city of santee had enforced against the company and other property owners 
however  the court allowed the city to continue to enforce a rent control ordinance that predated the two invalid ordinances the prior ordinance 
as a result of the judgment the company was entitled to collect a one time rent increase based upon the difference in annual adjustments between the invalid ordinance s and the prior ordinances and to adjust its base rents to reflect what the company could have charged had the prior ordinance been continually in effect 
the city of santee appealed the judgment 
the court of appeal and california supreme court refused to stay enforcement of these rent adjustments pending appeal 
after the city was unable to obtain a stay  the city and the tenant association each sued the company in separate actions alleging the rent adjustments pursuant to the judgment violate the prior ordinance case nos 
gie and gie 
they seek to rescind the rent adjustments  refunds of amounts paid  and penalties and damages in these separate actions 
on january   the california court of appeal reversed the judgment in part and affirmed it in part with a remand 
the court of appeal affirmed that one ordinance was unlawfully adopted and therefore void and that the second ordinance contained unconstitutional provisions 
however  the court ruled the city had the authority to cure the issues with the first ordinance retroactively 
on remand the trial court is directed to decide the issue of damages to the company which the company believes is consistent with the company receiving the economic benefit of invalidating one of the ordinances and also consistent with the company s position that it is entitled to market rent and not merely a higher amount of regulated rent 
in the remand action  the city of santee filed a motion seeking restitution of amounts collected by the company following the judgment which motion was denied 
the company intends to vigorously pursue its damages in the remand action and to vigorously defend the two new lawsuits 
in addition  the company has sued the city of santee in federal court alleging all three of the ordinances are unconstitutional under the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the united states constitution 
thus  it is the company s position that the ordinances are subject to invalidation as a matter of law in the federal court action 
separately  the federal district court granted the city s motion for summary judgment in the company s federal court lawsuit 
this decision was based not on the merits  but on procedural grounds  including that the company s claims were moot given its success in the state court case 
the company has appealed the decision 
in october  the united states supreme court granted certiorari in state of hawaii vs 
chevron usa  inc  a ninth circuit court of appeal case that upheld the standard that a regulation must substantially advance a legitimate state purpose in order to be constitutionally viable under the fifth amendment 
on may  the united states supreme court reversed the ninth circuit court of appeal in an opinion that clarified the standard of review for regulatory takings brought under the fifth amendment 
the supreme court held that the heightened scrutiny applied by the ninth circuit is not the applicable standard in a regulatory takings analysis  but is an appropriate factor for determining if a due process violation has occurred 
the court further clarified that regulatory takings would be determined in significant part by an analysis of the economic impact of the regulation 
the company believes that the severity of the economic impact on its properties caused by rent control will enable it to continue to challenge the rent regulations under the fifth amendment and the due process clause

long lived assets in accordance with the statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 we allocate the purchase price of properties we acquire to net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired based on their fair values 
in making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price  we utilize a number of sources  including independent appraisals that may be available in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective property and other market data 
we also consider information obtained about each property as a result of our due diligence  marketing and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired 
we periodically evaluate our long lived assets  including our investments in real estate  for impairment indicators 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on factors such as operational performance  market conditions and legal factors 
future events could occur which would cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted 
real estate is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation 
depreciation is computed on the straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
we use a year estimated life for buildings acquired and structural and land improvements  a ten to fifteen year estimated life for building upgrades and a three to seven year estimated life for furniture  fixtures and equipment 
expenditures for ordinary maintenance and repairs are expensed to operations as incurred and significant renovations and improvements that improve the asset and extend the useful life of the asset are capitalized over their estimated useful life

the company determined that a taxable transaction in connection with the special distribution to stockholders would be in the company s best interests 
this was accomplished by the contribution of the company s interest in the operating partnership to mhc trust in exchange for all of the common and preferred stock of mhc trust 
due to the company s tax basis in its interest in the operating partnership  the company recognized million of taxable income as a result of its contribution  as opposed to a nontaxable reduction of the company s tax basis in its interest in the operating partnership 
this restructuring resulted in a step up in the company s tax basis in its assets  generating future depreciation deductions  which in turn will reduce the company s future distribution requirements 
this provides the company with greater financial flexibility and greater growth potential 
the company intends to continue to qualify as a reit under the code  with its assets consisting of interests in mhc trust 
mhc trust  in turn  also intends to qualify as a real estate investment trust under the code and will continue to be the general partner of the operating partnership

inflation substantially all of the leases at the properties allow for monthly or annual rent increases which provide us with the opportunity to achieve increases  where justified by the market  as each lease matures

funds from operations funds from operations ffo is a non gaap financial measure 
we believe ffo  as defined by the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit  to be an appropriate measure of performance for an equity reit 
while ffo is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance for equity reits  it does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by gaap  and it should not be considered as an alternative to these indicators in evaluating liquidity or operating performance 
ffo is defined as net income  computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of properties  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis 
we believe that ffo is helpful to investors as one of several measures of the performance of an equity reit 
we further believe that by excluding the effect of depreciation  amortization and gains or losses from sales of real estate  all of which are based on historical costs and which may be of limited relevance in evaluating current performance  ffo can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and among other equity reits 
investors should review ffo  along with gaap net income and cash flow from operating activities  investing activities and financing activities  when evaluating an equity reit s operating performance 
we compute ffo in accordance with standards established by nareit  which may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition differently than we do 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap  nor does it represent cash available to pay distributions and should not be considered as an alternative to net income  determined in accordance with gaap  as an indication of our financial performance  or to cash flow from operating activities  determined in accordance with gaap  as a measure of our liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs  including our ability to make cash distributions

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
our earnings  cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent on prevailing market interest rates 
the primary market risk we face is long term indebtedness  which bears interest at fixed and variable rates 
the fair value of our long term debt obligations is affected by changes in market interest rates 
at december   approximately or approximately billion of our outstanding debt had fixed interest rates  which minimizes the market risk until the debt matures 
for each increase in interest rates of or basis points  the fair value of the total outstanding debt would decrease by approximately million 
for each decrease in interest rates of or basis points  the fair value of the total outstanding debt would increase by approximately million 
at december   approximately or approximately million of our outstanding debt was short term and at variable rates 
earnings are affected by increases and decreases in market interest rates on this debt 
for each increase decrease in interest rates of or basis points  our earnings would increase decrease by approximately million annually
