we undertake no obligation to publicly revise these forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that arise after the date hereof 
overview we have commercialized the first phosphate based lithium ion technology and have brought to market our initial products utilizing this technology 
our mission is to drive the wide adoption of high performance  safe  low cost energy storage systems by drawing on the numerous benefits of our latest battery technology  saphion r  the experience of our management team and the significant market opportunity available to us 
the introduction of lithium ion technology to the market was the result of consumer demand for high energy  small battery solutions to power portable electronic devices 
the battery industry  consequently  focused on high energy solutions at the expense of safety 
additionally  due to safety concerns  lithium ion technology has been limited in adoption to small format applications  such as notebook computers  cell phones  and personal digital assistant devices 
our saphion r technology  a phosphate based cathode material  addresses the need for a safe lithium ion solution  especially in large format applications 
our business plan and strategy focus on the generation of revenue from product sales  while minimizing costs through a manufacturing plan that utilizes partnerships with contract manufacturers and internal manufacturing efforts through our newly formed wholly foreign owned enterprises wfoe s in china 
these wfoe s initiated operations in late fiscal we plan to drive the adoption of our saphion r technology by offering existing and new solutions that differentiate our own products and end users products in both the large format and small format markets 
in addition  we will seek to expand the fields of use of our saphion r technology through licensing of our intellectual property related to our battery chemistries and manufacturing processes 
to date  valence has achieved the following successes implementing our business plan o proven the feasibility of our technology  o launched new saphion r technology based products  including our n charge tm power system family and introduced our u charge r power system family of products  which is intended to be a direct replacement for existing lead acid battery solutions in the market today and serve emerging motive applications  o established relationships with top tier customers across many of the target markets for our products  while continuing to build our brand awareness in multiple channel  o closed and sold our high cost manufacturing facility in northern ireland and established key manufacturing partnerships in asia to facilitate low cost  quality production  o announced a joint technology development program with segway inc to develop long range battery packs using our saphion r technology for segway s human transporter product 
production of the segway battery packs began in march and they are currently available through segway s distribution channel  o established three china facilities to serve as our powder production  research and development  and assembly facilities  and o launched a phosphate based lithium ion power cell 
batteries designed with power cells can be discharged and charged more quickly than batteries designed with energy cells 
this makes them ideal for applications that require powerful bursts rather than slow discharges of energy  such as portable appliances and future generations of hybrid and electric vehicles 
our new saphion r power cell offers significant cycling  weight and longevity benefits over nickel metal hydride nimh and nickel cadmium nicad battery technologies 
in fiscal we were able to achieve several important goals in support of our business strategy 
total revenue grew by as compared to the prior year to million with battery and system sales growing 
we achieved improvement of our negative gross margin and expanded our development and channel launch of saphion r based products 
we continued our efforts to transition our manufacturing and other operations to china through the establishment and commencement of initial operations of two wholly owned subsidiaries in suzhou  china 
our business headquarters is in austin  texas 
our materials research and development center is in las vegas  nevada 
our european sales and oem manufacturing support center is in mallusk  northern ireland 
our manufacturing and product development centers are in suzhou and shanghai  china 
basis of presentation  critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts 
we believe our most critical accounting policies and estimates relate to revenue recognition  impairment of long lived assets  exit costs  contract settlement charges  and joint venture dissolution 
our accounting policies are described in the notes to consolidated financial statements  note  summary of significant accounting policies 
the following further describes the methods and assumptions we use in our critical accounting policies and estimates 
revenue recognition we generate revenues from sales of products including batteries and battery systems  and from licensing fees and royalties per technology license agreements 
product sales are recognized when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  seller s price to the buyer is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
product shipments that are not recognized as revenue during the period shipped  primarily product shipments to resellers that are subject to right of return  are recorded as deferred revenue and reflected as a liability on our balance sheet 
for reseller shipments where revenue recognition is deferred  we record revenue based upon the reseller supplied reporting of sales to their end customers or their inventory reporting 
for direct customers  we estimate a return rate percentage based upon our historical experience 
we review this estimate on a quarterly basis 
from time to time we provide sales incentives in the form of rebates or other price adjustments  these are recorded as reductions to revenue as incurred 
licensing fees are recognized as revenue upon completion of an executed agreement and delivery of licensed information  if there are no significant remaining vendor obligations and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
royalty revenues are recognized upon licensee revenue reporting and when collectibility is reasonably assured 
impairment of long lived assets we perform a review of long lived tangible and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying amounts to future undiscounted cash flows that the assets are expected to generate 
if long lived assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair value and is recorded in the period the determination was made 
see notes to consolidated financial statements  note  impairment charge  regarding impairment of tangible and intangible assets 
exit costs we incurred exit costs associated with the closure of our northern ireland manufacturing facility 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  we recognize liabilities for costs associated with exit or disposal activities at fair value in the period during which the liability is incurred 
we estimate the liabilities related to exit or disposal activities including lease termination costs  compensation of terminated employees  inventory obsolescence  costs to prepare assets for disposal or sale  and other expenses based upon our analysis of individual transaction circumstances  agreements and commitments 
some agreements may be revised  or actual results may be different from costs reasonably estimated at the incurrence of the liability 
in these cases  additional costs or reduced costs are recorded in the period incurred  and differences are disclosed in the footnotes to consolidated financial statements 
costs associated with exit or disposal activities are included in restructuring charges 
contract settlement charge since  pursuant to a letter of offer  we received employment and capital grants from the ireland development board  now known as invest northern ireland ini  for our former manufacturing facility in mallusk  northern ireland  totaling pound million 
under certain circumstances  ini had the right to reclaim a portion of these grants and had a security interest in the facility s land  building  and equipment 
on december   we entered into a settlement agreement with ini pursuant to which ini agreed to release us of all outstanding claims and other obligations owing to ini in connection with grants previously provided 
under the terms of the settlement agreement we agreed to pay ini pound million consisting of a pound million payment in cash and a pound million payment in common stock

under the terms of the joint venture agreement  we were to contribute of the joint venture s registered capital  consisting of capital equipment  a nonexclusive license to its technology  and engineering expertise 
fengfan was to contribute of the joint venture s registered capital  consisting of the cash required to fund the joint venture for the first two years  and also to acquire the land and facility needed for manufacturing operations 
as a result of our ownership of the joint venture  right to name the majority of the joint venture s board of directors and right to name the chief executive officer as of march   our consolidated financial statements included the consolidation of the balance sheet  results of operations and cash flows of the joint venture 
however  during the first quarter of fiscal  a dispute arose between us and our joint venture partner  resulting in a loss of control over the joint venture and our initiation of an action to enforce our rights under the joint venture agreement and  commencing with that quarter we accounted for our investment in the joint venture under the cost method with no further recognition of assets  liabilities  operating results  and cash flows 
on november   we entered into a settlement agreement  or the jv settlement agreement  with baoding fengfan group limited liability company  ltd  or fengfan  and baoding fengfan valence battery company  ltd  or the jv company 
under the terms of the jv settlement agreement  the parties agreed to liquidate and dissolve the jv company  terminate the jv company contracts and fully settle any and all remaining obligations among the parties

we achieved the largest growth in fiscal sales in education channels  accounting for almost million of our total product sales 
product shipments to resellers that are subject to right of return or monies received for exclusivity or future obligations are recorded on the balance sheet as deferred revenue 
we had million in deferred revenue on our balance sheet at march  as compared to million on march  we expect sales of the n charge tm power system to continue to grow moderately in fiscal we launched our large format products in late with the k charge system and u charge family during fiscal in fiscal  we launched our long range battery pack for use in segway inc human transporter as well as further expansions of our u charge family of products 
segway accounted for of our total product sales in licensing and royalty revenue for fiscal years through  license and royalty revenue was primarily derived from license fees and royalty payments  relating to our battery construction  from amperex technology limited atl including a one time license fee payment of million in fiscal and on going royalty payments as sales are made by atl using our technology 
we expect to continue to pursue a licensing strategy as our saphion r technology receives greater market acceptance 
gross margin loss gross margin loss as a percentage of revenue was for the year ended march  as compared to a gross margin loss of for the fiscal year ended march  and a gross margin loss of for the year ended march  although our gross margin loss has improved  we maintained a negative gross margin on our sales in all periods because of insufficient production and sales volumes to cover our indirect and fixed manufacturing operating costs 
fiscal years and margin improvements were offset by inventory valuation adjustments of million and million as of march  and  related to valuation of our work in process cell inventory and lower of cost or market tests for our early launch and us sourced large format products 
we have successfully transitioned our battery manufacturing and n charge tm product assembly operations to contract manufacturers in asia 
as of april  we completed the transition of our powder manufacturing to our wfoe s in suzhou  china 
we also transitioned our additional manufacturing pack assembly operations to our facilities in suzhou  china in fiscal during fiscal  we had significant expenses due to issues with our powder manufacturing 
we expect cost of sales to continue to decrease during fiscal  as a percentage of sales  as production volumes continue to increase  as we continue to implement our lower cost manufacturing strategy  and as we launch higher margin products 
operating expenses the following table summarizes our operating expenses during each of the past three fiscal years year ended march  change march  change march  dollars in thousands operating expenses research and product development    marketing    general and administrative    depreciation and amortization  gain on disposal of assets   asset impairment charge  restructuring charge contact settlement charge  ini  contact settlement charge  other total operating expenses    of total revenue we continued to focus on our operating expense management throughout fiscal operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to in fiscal versus in fiscal and in fiscal the decrease is the result of increased revenues  as well as our focus on expense reductions during fiscal  our final settlement with the ini  the gain on the sale of our mallusk  northern ireland facility  and reduced impairment and depreciation expenses related to our assets as we finalized our transition plans 
the decrease in operating expense as a percent of revenue was offset by relocation of manufacturing and development operations to china as well as settlements of other contracts

research and product development expenses totaled million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal we achieved year over year decreases in research and development in fiscal and of and  respectively 
decreases in research and development expenses were the result of cessation of process development work in our northern ireland facility and reductions in research headcount  temporary staff  and consulting expenses and material costs in our henderson  nevada facility 
we expect to continue to achieve reductions in research and product development expenses as we improve our product development efficiency and transition portions of our development efforts to asia 
marketing marketing expenses consist primarily of costs related to sales and marketing personnel  public relations and promotional materials 
after expanding our marketing expenses in fiscal to increase staffing  advertising and promotions to support brand awareness and expansion of sales channels for our products  we eliminated the lower performing of these programs and achieved decrease in marketing expenses in fiscal as compared to fiscal while achieving a growth in product revenue

the year over year increases in general and administrative expense in fiscal were caused by our ongoing relocation and establishment of manufacturing and development operations to china  increased costs of compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of  and costs related to shutting down our northern ireland facility 
other costs related to our manufacturing transition impairment charge there were impairment charges of  and  recorded during fiscal years and  respectively 
in  we reduced the carrying value of certain software related to our manufacturing cost and accounting processes 
in  as a result of our decision to relocate manufacturing operations from our leased henderson  nevada facility to a newly formed subsidiary in suzhou  china  equipment and fixtures in the nevada facility would not generate cash flows greater than their carrying value 
assets with carrying value of approximately  were written down in full to fair value  as we estimate that there will be no future cash flows from these assets 
during the second quarter of  we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million 
the charge was recorded pursuant to fasb statement no 
 accounting for impairment of disposal of long lived assets 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we decided to transfer manufacturing from our northern ireland facility to low cost manufacturing in china and consequently determined that the carrying value of certain manufacturing assets at our northern ireland facility exceed expected future cash flows from these assets 
additionally  we determined that the future cash flows expected to be generated from certain technology we acquired from telcordia in december did not exceed their carrying value 
the impairment charge was recorded against property  plant  and equipment and intellectual property with a carrying value of million to recognize these assets at their fair value 
fair value was determined based on estimated future cash flows to be generated by these assets  discounted at our market rate of interest of

supplier contract terminations during the third quarter of fiscal  as a result of our relocating our core operations to china and selection of lower cost suppliers  we terminated two supplier contracts related to producing product and manufacturing capital equipment 
in settlement of these contracts  we paid these suppliers termination fees which include the settlement expenses accrued in fiscal of approximately  restructuring charge in the third fiscal quarter of  we recorded restructuring charges of  related to the closing of our northern ireland facility 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we completed the transition of our battery production from our northern ireland manufacturing facility to our oem supplier 
remaining payment obligations for factory equipment operating leases that extended beyond december  were approximately  these lease payment obligations provide no economic benefit to us  and contractual lease costs of approximately  were recorded as restructuring charges during the quarter ended december  gain on sale of assets gain on sales of the facility and production and development equipment from our former mallusk  northern ireland facility was  and million in fiscal years and the majority of the gain is related to the sales of our northern ireland facility completed in fiscal additionally  we determined that some equipment was not required in our manufacturing and development operations in suzhou  china and was sold for fair value 
depreciation and amortization  interest expense and other expenses depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense totaled   and million for fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
the decrease in depreciation expenses resulted from the assets in our northern ireland facility being classified as held for sale and not depreciated beginning in the third quarter of fiscal  the impact of the impairment charges to intellectual property and property  plant and equipment and the impact of the sale of our henderson  nevada facility 
interest expense interest expense relates to our long term debt with a stockholder and third party  as well as mortgages on our northern ireland facility 
we completed the sale of our northern ireland facility and paid off the mortgages on december  interest expense was million  million and million for the fiscal years  and  respectively

the warrant exercise period originally ended on july   and was extended to july   at which time the warrants terminated unexercised 
the non cash expense related to the exercise period extension of  was determined using the black scholes model  with risk free rate of  expected life of years  and volatility of 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity at march   our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents of million and million remaining under the million backup equity funding commitment entered into in june with mr 
carl berg  our chairman of the board and principal stockholder 
subsequent to march  we have exhausted the million remaining under mr 
berg s funding commitment through a drawn down of million and receipt of net proceeds of million from the sale of stock under a controlled equity offering agreement with cantor fitzgerald 
although mr 
berg may continue to fund the company s operations he is under no obligation to do so 
we intend to improve our liquidity by the continued monitoring and reduction of manufacturing  facility and administrative costs 
however  notwithstanding these efforts  we do not expect our cash on hand and cash generated by operations will be sufficient to fund our operating and capital needs beyond the next three months 
as a result of our limited cash resources and history of operating losses  our auditors have expressed in their report on our financial statements included herein that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
we presently have no further commitments for financing by mr 
berg or any other source 
if we are unable to obtain financing from mr 
berg or others on terms acceptable to us  or at all  we may be forced to cease all operations and liquidate our assets 
our cash requirements may vary materially from those now planned because of changes in our operations  including the failure to achieve expected revenues  greater than expected expenses  changes in oem relationships  market conditions  the failure to timely realize our product development goals  and other adverse developments 
these events could have a negative impact on our available liquidity sources during fiscal the following table summarizes our statement of cash flows for the fiscal years ended march   and in thousands year ended march  march  march  net cash flows provided by used in operating activities    investing activities    financing activities    effect of foreign exchange rates net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents   our use of cash from operations during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal was million  million and million  respectively

is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  the adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which revises sfas sfas r also supersedes apb and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
sfas r eliminates the alternative to account for employee stock options under apb and requires the fair value of all share based payments to employees  including the fair value of grants of employee stock options to be recognized in the statement of operations  generally over the vesting period 
in march  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 which provides additional implementation guidance for sfas r 
among other things  sab provides guidance on share based payment valuations  income statement classification and presentations  capitalization of costs and related income tax accounting 
sfas r provides for adoption using either the modified prospective or modified retrospective transition method 
we will adopt sfas r on april  using the modified prospective transition method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning april  for all share based payments granted on or after that date and for all awards granted to employees prior to april  that remain unvested on that date 
we will continue to use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock option awards 
adoption of sfas r s fair value method will have an effect on results of operations  although it will not have a material impact on our overall financial position 
the future impact of sfas r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depends on levels of share based payments granted 
however  had sfas r been adopted in prior periods  the effect would have approximated the sfas pro forma net loss and net loss per share disclosures as shown in note to the consolidated financial statements  sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as currently required  thereby reducing net operating cash flows and increasing net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
in march  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations fin 
fin clarifies that an entity must record a liability for a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the obligation can be reasonably estimated 
we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows

changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
this statement requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
this statement redefines restatements as the revising of previously issued financial statements to reflect the correction of an error 
sfas no 
requires that retrospective application of a change in accounting principle be limited to the direct effects of the change 
this statement also requires that a change in depreciation  amortization  or depletion method for long lived  non financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate affected by a change in accounting principle 
sfas no 
is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows
