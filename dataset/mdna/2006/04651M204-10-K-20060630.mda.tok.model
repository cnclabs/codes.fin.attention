june  march  balance sheet data cash working deficit capital total assets total debt stockholders deficit equity item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview going concern a weak holiday season for the industry combined with underperformance from new product launches and product launch delays have contributed to fiscal year results substantially below our expectations 
for the year ended march  
table of contents  we generated net losses of million  and  for the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  were not in compliance with certain financial covenants on our credit facility with hsbc  which has expired as of the date hereof 
historically  we have relied on iesa to provide limited financial support to us  however  as iesa continues to address its own financial condition  its ability to fund its subsidiaries operations  including ours  remains limited 
therefore  there can be no assurance we will ultimately receive any funding from them 
the uncertainties caused by these conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
the consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty 
we are exploring various alternatives to improve our financial position and secure other sources of financing 
such possibilities include a replacement of the credit facility  new arrangements to license intellectual property  the sale of selected intellectual property rights and sale of development studios 
to reduce working capital requirements and further conserve cash we will need to take additional actions in the near term  which may include further personnel reductions and suspension of certain development projects 
these actions may or may not prove to be consistent with our long term strategic objectives 
we cannot guarantee the completion of these actions or that such actions will generate sufficient resources to fully address the uncertainties of our financial position 
as of the date of this filing  we have raised approximately million  of which million was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal  through sales of certain intellectual properties  however  these amounts are insufficient to fully address the uncertainties of our financial position 
we continue to seek additional funding 
business and operating segments we are a global publisher and developer of video game software for gaming enthusiasts and the mass market audience  and a distributor of video game software in north america 
we develop  publish  and distribute games for all platforms  including sony playstation  playstation  playstation  and psp  nintendo game boy advance  gamecube  ds  and wii  microsoft xbox and xbox  and personal computers  referred to as pcs 
we also publish and sublicense games for the wireless  internet  and other evolving platforms  an area to which we expect to devote increasing attention 
our diverse portfolio of products extends across most major video game genres  including action  adventure  strategy  role playing  and racing 
our products are based on intellectual properties that we have created internally and own or that have been licensed to us by third parties 
we leverage both internal and external resources in the development of our games  assessing each project independently to determine which development team is best suited to handle the product based on technical expertise and historical development experience  among other factors 
additionally  through our relationship with iesa  our products are distributed exclusively by iesa throughout europe  asia and other regions 
through our distribution agreement with iesa  we have the rights to publish and sublicense in north america certain intellectual properties either owned or licensed by iesa or its subsidiaries  including atari interactive 
we also manage the development of product at studios owned by iesa that focus solely on game development 
in addition to our publishing and development activities  we also distribute video game software in north america for titles developed by third party publishers with whom we have contracts 
as a distributor of video game software throughout the us  we maintain what we believe to be state of the art distribution operations and systems  reaching well in excess of  retail outlets nationwide 
the distribution channels for interactive software have expanded significantly in recent years 
consumers have access to interactive software through a variety of outlets  including mass merchant retailers such as wal mart and target  major retailers  such as best buy and toys r us  and specialty stores such as gamestop electronics boutique 
additionally  our games are made available through various internet and online networks 
our sales to key customers wal mart  gamestop electronics boutique  target  and best buy accounted for approximately    and  respectively  of net revenues for the year ended march  humongous discontinued operations treatment in the fourth quarter of fiscal  following the guidance established under fasb statement no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  management committed to a plan to divest of humongous 
during the second quarter of fiscal  selected humongous assets were sold to our majority stockholder  iesa in exchange for  of their shares valued at million 
humongous book value approximated million and consisted primarily of intellectual property  existing inventory  license rights  and an allocation of goodwill of million 
the difference of approximately million between the sale price and the humongous book value was recorded to additional paid in capital  as no gain can be recorded on sales of businesses with entities under common control 

table of contents immediately following the sale  we entered into a distribution agreement  dated as of august   the humongous distribution agreement  with humongous  inc formerly humongous  a newly formed wholly owned subsidiary of iesa  under which were to be the sole distributor in the us  canada  and mexico of products developed by humongous  inc this agreement had a term through march   with an option to extend through march   at the discretion of humongous inc although this distribution agreement was expected to generate continuing cash flows from the distribution of their product  it was expected that iesa would have sold humongous  inc to a third party within twelve months from the disposal date of august  as of june  we have determined that  while humongous is expected to be sold  the potential buyer has requested us to continue to distribute humongous  inc s products beyond the assessment period ending august   and therefore will not eliminate our significant continuing involvement 
therefore under guidance established under fasb statement no 
 we no longer qualify to consider humongous a discontinued operation and have reclassified its results back to continuing operations and its assets and liabilities as held and used for all periods presented 
key challenges the video game software industry has experienced an increased rate of change and complexity in the technological innovations of video game hardware and software 
in addition to these technological innovations  there has been greater competition for shelf space and creative talent as well as increased buyer selectivity 
as a result  the video game industry has become increasingly hit driven  which has led to higher per game production budgets  longer and more complex development processes  and generally shorter product life cycles 
the importance of the timely release of hit titles  as well as the increased scope and complexity of the product development process  have increased the need for disciplined product development processes that limit costs and overruns 
this  in turn  has increased the importance of leveraging the technologies  characters or storylines of existing hit titles into additional video game software franchises in order to spread development costs among multiple products 
in this environment  we are determined to achieve balances between internal and external development  and licensed and proprietary products 
due primarily to our limited funds  we have during the past two years reduced substantially our expenditures on product development and sold the intellectual property related to some game franchises that had generated substantial revenues for us 
this has both materially reduced our revenues and made distribution a larger percentage of our business 
we are reviewing our operating strategy  and it is likely that we will increasingly focus on distribution in various forms of products developed by others as a source of revenue 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to accounts and notes receivable  inventories  intangible assets  investments  income taxes and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition  sales returns  price protection  other customer related allowances and allowance for doubtful accounts revenue is recognized when title and risk of loss transfer to the customer  provided that collection of the resulting receivable is deemed probable by management 
sales are recorded net of estimated future returns  price protection and other customer related allowances 
we are not contractually obligated to accept returns  however  based on facts and circumstances at the time a customer may request approval for a return  we may permit the return or exchange of products sold to certain customers 
in addition  we may provide price protection  co operative advertising and other allowances to certain customers in accordance with industry practice 
these reserves are determined based on historical experience  market acceptance of products produced  retailer inventory levels  budgeted customer allowances  the nature of the title and existing commitments to customers 
although 
table of contents management believes it provides adequate reserves with respect to these items  actual activity could vary from management s estimates and such variances could have a material impact on reported results 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the failure of our customers to make payments when due or within a reasonable period of time thereafter 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an inability to make required payments  additional allowances may be required 
for the years ended march    and  we recorded allowances for bad debts  returns  price protection and other customer promotional programs of approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
as of march  and march   the aggregate reserves against accounts receivable for bad debts  returns  price protection and other customer promotional programs were approximately million and million  respectively 
inventories we write down our inventories for estimated slow moving or obsolete inventories equal to the difference between the cost of inventories and estimated market value based upon assumed market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those assumed by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
for the years ended march    and  we recorded obsolescence expense of approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
as of march  and march   the aggregate reserve against inventories was approximately million and million  respectively 
research and product development costs research and product development costs related to the design  development  and testing of new software products  whether internally or externally developed  are charged to expense as incurred 
research and product development costs also include payments for royalty advances milestone payments to third party developers for products that are currently in development 
once a product is sold  we may be obligated to make additional payments in the form of backend royalties to developers which are calculated based on contractual terms  typically a percentage of sales 
such payments are expensed and included in cost of goods sold in the period the sales are recorded 
rapid technological innovation  shelf space competition  shorter product life cycles and buyer selectivity have made it difficult to determine the likelihood of individual product acceptance and success 
as a result  we follow the policy of expensing milestone payments as incurred  treating such costs as research and product development expenses 
due to recently implemented enhancements in our internal project planning and acceptance process and anticipated additional improvements in our ability to assess post release consumer acceptance  we are currently considering a change from expensing such costs when incurred to a method of deferral and amortization  when appropriate over each product s life cycle 
such change may be implemented prospectively as early as our next fiscal year 
management believes that the ability to amortize such costs over the product s life cycle will result in a better matching of costs and revenues 
licenses licenses for intellectual property are capitalized as assets upon the execution of the contract when no significant obligation of performance remains with us or the third party 
if significant obligations remain  the asset is capitalized when payments are due or when performance is completed as opposed to when the contract is executed 
these licenses are amortized at the licensor s royalty rate over unit sales to cost of goods sold 
management evaluates the carrying value of these capitalized licenses and records an impairment charge in the period management determines that such capitalized amounts are not expected to be realized 
such impairments are charged to cost of goods sold if the product has released or previously sold  and if the product has never released  these impairments are charged to research and product development 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our current tax exposures in each jurisdiction including the impact  if any  of additional taxes resulting from tax examinations as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets 
to the extent recovery of deferred tax assets is not likely based on our estimation of future taxable income in each jurisdiction  a valuation allowance is established 
the estimated effective tax rate is adjusted for the tax related to significant unusual items 
changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pre tax income can affect the overall effective tax rate 

table of contents as of march   we have combined net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million for federal and state tax purposes 
these loss carryforwards are available to offset future taxable income  if any  and will expire beginning in the years through we experienced an ownership change in as a result of the acquisition by iesa 
under section of the internal revenue code  when there is an ownership change  the pre ownership change loss carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation which could reduce or defer the utilization of these losses 
pre acquisition losses of approximately million are subject to an annual limitation approximately million 
we are considering transactions that might subject additional loss carryforwards to an annual limitation 
a full valuation allowance has been recorded against our net deferred tax asset of million  based on our historical operating results and the conclusion that it is more likely than not that such asset will not be realized 
management reassesses its position with regard to the valuation allowance on a quarterly basis 
related party transactions we are involved in numerous related party transactions with iesa and its subsidiaries 
these related party transactions include  but are not limited to  the purchase and sale of product  game development  administrative and support services and distribution agreements
