overview we provide integrated end to end solutions for wireless voice and data communications networks with offerings ranging from high level technical consulting  to system design and turnkey deployment  to operations and maintenance services 
we have been successful on occasion in using initial opportunities to provide high level technical consulting services to secure later stage system design and deployment contracts 
long term engagements to provide design and or deployment services also enable us to secure ongoing operations and maintenance projects 
providing ongoing operations and maintenance services also positions us well for additional opportunities as new technologies continue to be developed and wireless service providers must either upgrade their existing networks or deploy new networks utilizing the latest available technologies 
we provide these services through a regional organization  which comprises two principal regions and several smaller divisions 
our primary operating segments are americas and emea europe  middle east and africa 
americas headquartered in mclean  virginia  the americas region provides the full range of service offerings to wireless operators and equipment vendors through a network of project offices in north america and south america 
in  americas generated approximately of our total revenue 
emea based in london  the europe  middle east and africa region is responsible for operations in the uk  italy  the netherlands  algeria  germany  spain  greece  saudi arabia and the middle east 
in  emea generated approximately of our total revenue 
nonreportable segments this segment of our business includes our operations in asia  the wireless institute  lcc wireline and corporate 
in  these combined operations generated less than of our total revenues 
we provide training to our engineers and customers through our wireless institute  which covers the latest technologies developed and employed throughout the world 
lcc wireline ceased operations in the first quarter of our primary sources of revenues are from engineering design and system deployment services 
revenues from services are derived both from fixed price and time and materials contracts 
we recognize revenues from fixed price service contracts using the percentage of completion method based on the ratio of individual contract costs incurred to date on a project compared with total estimated costs on completion 
anticipated contract losses are recognized as they become known and estimable 
we recognize revenues on time and materials contracts as the services are performed 
cost of revenues includes direct compensation and benefits  living and travel expenses  payments to third party subcontractors and consultants  equipment rentals  expendable computer software and equipment  and allocated  or directly attributed  facility and overhead costs identifiable to projects 
general and administrative expenses consist of compensation  benefits  office and occupancy  and other costs required for the finance  human resources  information systems  and executive office functions 
sales and marketing expenses consist of salaries  benefits  sales commissions  travel and other related expenses required to implement our marketing  sales and customer support plans 
we generate cash from fixed price contracts by billings associated with contract milestones  which are typically agreed with our customers at the time the contracts are negotiated 
for our time and materials contracts  we usually bill our customers on a monthly basis as services are performed 
on large network deployment contracts  which involve the design and construction of complex wireless networks  it is increasingly common for our customers to require fewer contract milestones than in previous years 
this results in extending the periods during which we are obliged to fund our operating costs until a milestone can be billed to the customer 
this increases the capital that we require to operate the business  and is evidenced by increases in unbilled receivables on our balance sheet 
this is an integral part of our business and we are constantly striving to manage our working capital requirements 
another critical statistic that we monitor is our contract backlog  which at december   comprised firm backlog of million and implied backlog of million 
we expect that our contract backlog will vary from time to time as we deliver contract revenues and win new awards 
since  we have engaged in a number of business dispositions  acquisitions and investments  some of which have either generated significant cash proceeds or created significant requirements for cash and these transactions significantly affect the year to year comparability of our financial statements 
for example  in  we sold our tower business for cash proceeds of about million  and in  we sold certain of our interests in nextwave telecom  inc  or nextwave  for cash proceeds of about million 
later in that year and during  we acquired operations in our emea region  which required cash of approximately million 
in we sold further interests in nextwave for another million and we initiated our investment in the joint venture in china  which required total cash commitments of about million 
in  we sold an unsecured claim against nextwave for million and recorded an impairment charge of million for our investment in the joint venture in china  following changes in the local business conditions 
in the second quarter of  the company received cash payment of approximately million from nextwave for the exercise of all warrants held by the company 
the exercise was made in accordance with the terms of nextwave s reorganization plan under bankruptcy proceedings 
in the fourth quarter of  we sold off the one remaining tower that we owned for million 
we expect to continue to consider business dispositions  acquisitions and investments as a way of supporting our longer term strategies 
trends that have affected or may affect results of operations and financial condition the major trends that have affected or may affect our business are as follows project related revenues derived from a limited set of customers in each market where we do business  the acceleration or the delay associated with the introduction of new technologies and services by our customers  the management and the services composition of our fixed price contracts  the impact of the percentage of subcontracted work versus self perform work on our large programs and the associated margin degradation  customers agreeing to exclude construction services from fixed price contracts  and increased spending by wireless service providers in the areas of network design  deployment and optimization 
our business is characterized by a limited number of projects awarded by a limited number of customers 
this can lead to volatility in our results as projects initially ramp up and then wind down 
as projects are completed  we are faced with the task of replacing project revenues with new projects  either from the same customer or from new customers 
in addition  the wireless industry is composed of a relatively small number of wireless service providers and equipment vendors  and this inevitably leads to issues of customer concentration 
consequently  our business may be affected in any single market by the changing priorities of a small group of customers 
we tend to benefit from projects undertaken by our customers to introduce new technologies and services in their networks and we tend to suffer when projects are delayed 
revenues from g networks constituted approximately and of our total revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively  and it is expected to be an area of business growth in the future 
a large proportion of the contracts awarded by our customers are fixed price  and we expect this trend to continue 
a recent trend is for the award of fixed price contracts to cover the design and deployment of a certain geographic network area on a full turnkey basis  including planning  engineering design  site acquisition  construction and deployment services 
in  approximately of our revenues were generated by work done by subcontractors  for construction related activities  compared to in to the extent that we are successful in reducing the amount of construction related activities in our north america deployment operations  we expect that the composition of our revenues by delivery method will vary so as to increase the proportion of services that we perform ourselves through our own workforce and decrease the services that we deliver through third parties  typically subcontractors for construction 
a consequence of this change in mix may be to reduce our north american revenues and to increase our average gross margins because subcontracted work generally commands lower margins 
recently  we have seen a trend with respect to fixed price contracts where our customers have agreed to exclude actual construction services from these contracts and to contract for them directly with the construction service providers 
we believe our americas region may benefit from increased spending by certain united states wireless service providers 
this increased spending can be attributed to several trends i the implementation of new technologies such as g wireless and broadband wireless  ii activity generated by efforts to consolidate networks resulting from merger activity in  iii network quality enhancement programs to reduce churn  iv network expansion and capacity programs geared toward enabling new and enhanced services  and v other miscellaneous network upgrades and enhancements required for market share maintenance and competitive reasons 
we have also observed an increase in spending on wireless networks in developing countries 
however  the increase in worldwide terrorism may affect our business in these countries 
for example  the us state department has issued security advisories for us nationals in saudi arabia  algeria and certain other countries in the middle east 
while we tend to staff these projects largely with local or regional personnel  we do recognize that undertaking work in such areas at this time carries a higher level of operating and political risk than in other more developed areas 
results of operations the discussion below provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
revenues  cost of revenues and gross margins years ended december  in thousands in thousands in thousands revenues americas emea nonreportable segments of revenue of revenue of revenue cost of revenues americas emea nonreportable segments gross margin americas emea nonreportable segments americas in  the wireless market improved and opportunities increased for both rf wireless design work and for network deployment 
in the second half of  we began to recognize revenues associated with two large network deployment contracts awarded earlier in that year  us cellular and sprint 
the award of these major contracts  together with the steady growth in the region s rf wireless design business  enabled the region to bring its gross margins into a more normal expected range 
during the year  the region increased its use of subcontractors for the construction of cell sites in its network deployment business  and this also contributed to an increase in its cost of revenues 
in  subcontractors represented of the total revenue delivered by the region 
in  the revenue and gross margins for the region were dominated by the execution of the us cellular and sprint network deployment contracts  which were in backlog at the start of the year 
network deployment represented million of revenue  up over the previous year 
we continued to use subcontractors for the construction of cell sites in our network deployment business  and in about of our network deployment revenue was attributable to subcontractors compared to in the rf wireless design business represented revenue of million  an increase of over the previous year 
cost of revenues and gross margins for reflected the mix of the business and the high proportion of subcontractor costs  so that gross margins for network deployment and for rf wireless design amounted to and respectively  compared to and in  respectively 
the overall gross margin for the region was not materially different in compared to in  total revenues for the region were million  a decline of million from deployment revenues were million  down million from the decline is primarily due to the winding down of the us cellular project 
rf wireless design revenues were million  up million from cost of revenues was million for  a decline of million compared to the gross margin for the region during was compared to for a review of the company s deployment contract with a major customer in the north central region of the united states determined that the margin on the contract was significantly less than previously expected  primarily due to escalating construction costs 
as a result it was necessary to adjust the inception to date gross profit downward to recognize the effects of the lower margin 
this resulted in a decrease to earnings of million in the second quarter 
in late september  the company successfully amended this contract and a similar contract with the same customer in the southeast region of the united states 
as a result  in the third quarter of  it was necessary to adjust the inception to date gross profit for the two contracts upward to recognize the positive benefits of the contract amendments 
this resulted in an increase to earnings of million in the third quarter 
in the fourth quarter of construction costs continued to increase due to increased international demand for building materials and rising labor costs for construction in the united states associated with reconstruction along the gulf coast 
as a result  we had to lower the booking margins for these two contracts 
this caused earnings to be million lower in the fourth quarter than they would have been if the margin adjustments had not been made 
gross margin for the deployment business in was 
gross margin for rf wireless design was for the same period 
the loss from operations for was million  as compares to income from operations of million in because the company is seeking to reduce the amount of construction work that it subcontracts then bills to its north american deployment customers  it is reasonable to expect that revenues in the americas will decline in the near term 
however  this should improve the gross margin percentage and reduce the construction risk associated with deployment revenues 
emea in  operations in the developed countries  primarily europe  grew and we won additional projects in algeria 
total revenues in amounted to million  an increase of million over the previous year  million of this increase was attributable to algeria 
gross margin for the region increased to of revenue  which reflected improved efficiencies as the acquired operations in developed countries grew in volume  coupled with a higher proportion of self perform services from the algerian projects  which typically carry lower cost of revenues 
in  we expanded our operations in lesser developed countries as we commenced a multi year service project in saudi arabia and continued our consultancy and deployment activities in algeria 
revenues for the year grew to million  an increase of million over the previous year 
growth in our business in developed countries accounted for about million of this increase  while lesser developed countries accounted for about million  of this latter increase  million was attributable to saudi arabia 
developed countries generated about of our revenue and about of our gross profits  while lesser developed countries generated about of our revenues and of our gross profits 
gross margins improved from of revenues in to in  largely due to the increased mix of more profitable business in lesser developed countries  most of which is represented by time and materials contracts 
in  revenues for the year grew to million  an increase of million over the previous year 
the entire growth in revenue was attributable to the lesser developed countries 
saudi revenue growth for was million with algerian revenue growth of million 
lesser developed countries generated of gross profits 
overall gross margins improved in the year to from the in  largely due to the higher margins produced in the lesser developed countries 
nonreportable segments nonreportable segments generated revenues of million and million in and  respectively  which consisted of revenues from our asia operations  our wireless institute and lcc wireline 
in  we formed lcc wireline  which focused on providing technical services to clecs and ilecs 
it is this operation that accounted for the growth from to in revenues of about million and gross profits of million 
in  we purchased a share in a joint venture in beijing  china  with the objective of pursuing opportunities in china primarily through this joint venture 
in  we determined with our partner  bright oceans communications consulting boco  that this no longer represented a viable strategy  and we agreed with our partner to close the joint venture 
liquidation of the joint venture was completed in the fourth quarter of in the non reportable segments generated revenues of million  down million from this decline is primarily attributable to the wireline division  which ceased operations in the first quarter of and the closure of our beijing  china office as part of the restructuring in the second quarter of during  there was a loss from operations of million for the nonreportable segments  which compares to a loss from operations of million for the majority of this loss is attributable to corporate general and administrative costs  which are included in the nonreportable segment and are not allocated to the americas or emea

the increase was largely attributable to sales commissions in our new businesses in emea  particularly in saudi arabia 
in  sales and marketing expenses increased by million dollars 
sales and marketing costs increased million in emea due primarily to an increase in commission expense relating to the technical consulting contract in saudi arabia 
sales and marketing expenses declined million in the americas and million in the nonreportable segments primarily as a result of the cost restructuring undertaken during the second quarter 
net bad debt expense recovery in  the company wrote off million attributable to a provision against the receivable arising on a project in algeria 
in  the entire amount previously provided for in for the algerian project was subsequently recovered 
in the company had bad debt expense of million 
in  we had bad debt expense of million  of which million was recorded in the fourth quarter 
the bad debt expense was evenly divided amongst the segments and was not associated with any single customer nor with a single project 
shareholder note compensation shareholder note compensation relates to cash and non cash compensation arising from the loan made to our then chief executive officer  c 
thomas faulders  iii  in  a portion of which was subsequently deemed discharged in on december   we entered into an agreement with mr 
faulders  pursuant to which we purchased certain shares that mr 
faulders held in our company and returned these shares to our treasury account  where they are available for reissue 
mr 
faulders used the proceeds from his sale of these shares  approximately million  to reduce his indebtedness under the loan agreement  and we deemed the balance of the loan  approximately million  to have been paid in full 
this represents non cash compensation to mr 
faulders 
we also paid mr 
faulders cash compensation in the form of a bonus of approximately million to assist him in covering his tax obligations resulting from this agreement 
the total of the non cash compensation of million and the cash compensation of million is included in operating expenses in other general and administrative expenses in  other general and administrative expenses increased by million or compared to the previous year  reflecting a full year s cost of support for the acquired operations  their subsequent growth  and support for the additional contracts in algeria 
in  other general and administrative expenses increased by a further million or  primarily attributable to increases in costs in our emea region of million and in our corporate costs of million 
in emea  the increase was driven by support for new businesses in saudi arabia and germany  expansion of our activities in the netherlands  and severance and downsizing costs for italy 
the increase in our corporate costs was attributable to the costs of compliance with the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of in  other general and administrative expenses were million  an increase of million or 
most of this increase occurred in the nonreportable segments which includes corporate general and administrative expenses 
corporate general and administrative expenses were higher due to increased employee benefits costs  the costs of bringing onboard a new ceo  and costs associated with the restatement 
other general and administrative expenses for emea in include a management performance bonus 
restructuring in  following the completion of the xm project and the general reduction in the us market s wireless infrastructure spending  we restructured our operations and recorded a restructuring charge of million 
of this total charge  approximately million related to excess office space and million to severance costs for about employees 
most of the severance costs were expended in  and the reserve currently represents the future costs of excess office space  offset by our estimates of future income from sublease agreements 
the reduction in costs in reflects changes to our estimates of future reserve requirements following changes to either our business needs or our subleasing arrangements 
during the second quarter of  we adopted a restructuring plan and recorded a net restructuring charge of million 
included in the restructuring charge was million for severance related to the elimination of positions in corporate  north america and asia pacific 
an additional million was related to costs associated with closing facilities and disposing of assets 
because we reoccupied some of the leased office space that had previously been included in the reserve for restructuring  the reserve was reduced by million in the second quarter of in the fourth quarter  we reduced the restructuring reserve by approximately million due to a recovery of sublease income 
depreciation in  we ceased using the trade name acquired at the time of the purchase of smith woolley telecom in january therefore  depreciation and amortization expense in included the write off about million  which was the unamortized balance of intangible cost allocated to the trade name

interest expense in  detron established a line of credit with nmb heller nv nmb 
the line of credit provides that nmb will provide credit to detron in the form of advance payments collateralized by detron s outstanding receivables 
the agreement provides for nmb to advance up to of the receivable balance 
there is no maximum on the amount of receivables detron can assign to nmb 
detron must repay the advances from nmb within days or upon customer payment whichever occurs first 
interest on the advance payments will be calculated at a rate equal to nmb s overdraft base rate plus subject to a minimum of per year 
as of december  and detron had million and million outstanding under the credit facility at an interest rate of 
the agreement had an initial term of two years and was terminated on january  on july   the company  and commerce funding corporation cfc entered into an assignment and transfer of receivables agreement the agreement pursuant to which the company may elect to transfer certain of its accounts receivable to cfc in exchange for cash 
at the same time  the company  lcc wireless design and cfc entered into a fee agreement and each also entered into a general continuing guaranty agreement together collectively referred to as the financing documents 
outstanding advances under the financing documents bear interest at the prime rate as reported in the wall street journal 
cfc shall be entitled to various fees under the financing documents  including initially a monthly administrative fee of  on september   the financing documents were amended to increase the maximum amount which the company may owe to cfc by an additional  for a total of  the terms and conditions were the same as provided for in the original fee agreement except that the monthly administration fee increased from  to  on february   the financing documents were amended to increase the maximum amount which the company may owe to cfc by an additional amount of  for a total of  the terms and conditions were the same as provided for in the amended fee agreement except that the monthly administration fee increased from  to  at december   the company had  outstanding under the financing documents 
total interest expense for the year was  of which  was attributable to interest and fees arising from the financing arrangement with cfc 
gain loss on investments in  we received cash of approximately million for the sale of our general unsecured claim against nextwave  which we acquired as part of our acquisition of koll telecommunications llc in in the second quarter of  the company received cash payment of approximately million from nextwave for the exercise of all warrants held by the company 
the exercise was made in accordance with the terms of nextwave s reorganization plan under bankruptcy proceedings 
in the fourth quarter of  we sold off the one remaining tower that we owned for million 
we expect to continue to consider business dispositions  acquisitions and investments as a way of supporting our longer term strategies 
impairment of investments in we recorded impairment charges of million relating to our investment in the boco joint venture in china 
other income loss in  we recorded gains on foreign currencies of million  mostly attributable to the appreciation of the euro against the dollar in the second half of the year 
in  we recorded losses on foreign currencies of million due to the appreciation of the dollar against the euro and the british pound throughout the year 
income loss before taxes years ended december  in thousands segment income before taxes americas emea nonreportable transactions restructuring charge recovery americas emea nonreportable transactions income loss before taxes americas emea nonreportable transactions tax expense the increase in the income tax provision and effective tax rate from to is primarily attributable to additional valuation allowances and other adjustments against net operating losses 
as a net result of these additional valuation allowances and adjustments  we incurred a charge to the income tax provision of approximately million 
in addition  there were significant increases in branch income  primarily in saudi arabia  which was subject to tax in both the branch jurisdiction and in the parent company jurisdiction 
in  we recorded tax expense of million 
of that amount  million is for foreign taxes primarily associated with our profitable operations in saudi arabia and algeria 
this is partially offset by a tax benefit of million in the united states attributable to an expected tax refund of income tax paid in prior years 
as of december   a valuation allowance has been established because we do not have a sufficient history of taxable income at this time to conclude that it is more likely than not that the tax benefit of the net operating loss carryforwards will be realized 
we reached this conclusion after reviewing our historical operating losses for tax and financial statement purposes as well as our recent history of earnings and taxable income 
an additional valuation allowance of million has been established in we believe that  as of december   our cumulative historical losses  along with other qualitative factors and uncertainties concerning our business and industry  outweigh the positive evidence supporting the realizability of the tax benefit of our net operating loss carryforwards 
however  it is possible that an analysis of our financial results in future periods will provide sufficient positive evidence to indicate that the tax benefit of our cumulative loss carryforward can be realized  at which time we would expect a reversal of some or all of the remaining valuation allowance 
net loss in  revenues of million generated an operating loss of million 
gain on sale of an investment plus net interest income contributed million  resulting in a loss before taxes of million 
tax benefit was million  equivalent to an effective tax rate of  resulting in a reported net loss of million 
in  revenues of million generated an operating loss of million  which included shareholder note compensation of million 
gain on sale of an investment plus foreign exchange gains contributed million  resulting in a loss before taxes of million 
we recorded tax expense of million  which resulted in a reported net loss of million 
in  revenues of million generated an operating loss of million 
other expenses  primarily losses on foreign currencies  increased the loss by million  resulting in a loss before taxes of million 
we recorded tax expense of million  which resulted in a reported net loss of million 
liquidity and capital resources the following discussion relates to our sources and uses of cash and cash requirements during   and sources and uses of cash years ended december  in thosands net cash used in operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents net decrease in cash and cash equivalents in  the level of operational activities increased significantly  with revenues increasing to million and operating losses decreasing to million 
cash used in operations increased to million which consisted of million to fund operating losses and million to finance growth in our operating assets and liabilities  offset by the receipt of million of tax refunds 
cash used in investing activities was million  of which million was for property and equipment purchases and million for business acquisitions primarily the joint venture in china 
financing activities generated million  of which million was the net proceeds from the public offering of  shares of our class a common stock 
additionally  million was provided by the drawdowns on the line of credit established for detron in the netherlands 
the effect of exchange rates caused cash to increase by million 
overall  cash decreased by million in in  the level of operational activities grew by more than  with revenues increasing to million and operating losses decreasing to million after expensing the shareholder note compensation of million 
cash used in operations decreased to million  which consisted of million to fund operating losses and million to finance growth in our operating assets and liabilities 
cash used in investing activities was million  of which million was for property and equipment purchases and million for the joint venture in china 
financing activities generated million  of which million was the net proceeds from the exercise of options and million from the sale of short term investments and reduction of restricted cash  offset by net repayments of million on the line of credit established for detron 
the effect of exchange rates caused cash to decrease million 
overall  cash decreased by million in in operational activities were about the same as however  revenues of million resulted in an operating loss of million 
cash used in operating activities in the period was million  primarily as a result of the loss from operations 
cash used in investing activities was million  a large part of which was attributable to the purchase of test and measurement equipment in the emea region  while cash generated by financing activities was million primarily associated with million of increased borrowings 
the effect of exchange rates caused cash to decrease million 
overall  cash decreased by million in cash requirements years ended december  in thousands cash and cash equivalents restricted cash short term investments total cash and short term investments line of credit working capital future requirements of cash are likely to be affected by the continued changes in working capital  which are primarily caused by changes in receivables and work in progress as work is performed ahead of contractual billing milestones  as milestones are achieved and billed  and as payments are received from the customers 
if we are successful in our strategy to exclude construction costs from north america deployment contracts and are able to sell more high margin services such as rf engineering and consulting  our need to fund high levels of working capital should decline 
over the next year  we expect that working capital will remain at similar levels to those experienced over the past year  and we expect that our cash balances will remain comparable to current levels 
we believe that for at least the next twelve months we have adequate cash and access to financing to fund our operations 
existing contractual obligations are primarily limited to operating leases  mostly for office facilities 
those obligations are set out below 
fixed lease obligations are partly offset by income from sublease agreements 
our operating lease obligations at december  are as follows in thousands payment due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years operating lease obligations sublease income purchases of property and equipment are primarily related to project requirements  but are relatively insignificant compared to other requirements 
from time to time  we have made acquisitions and investments in joint ventures  and it is possible that this may be a source of cash requirements at some time in the future 
there are no immediate plans or commitments of this nature  which would result in significant cash requirements 
taxes are likely to be a cash requirement in the future for profitable foreign operations 
in  we established a line of credit for our subsidiary in the netherlands  collateralized by detron s outstanding accounts receivable  and in we have repaid advances so that only million of the line of credit was outstanding at december  this line of credit was terminated in the first quarter of during  we sold  shares of our class a common stock for net proceeds of approximately million as part of a public offering 
we may consider selling additional shares in the future  either to provide additional working capital or for specific purposes  such as acquisitions 
in  we negotiated the terms and conditions of a line of credit of million for the issue of standby letters of credit  which will be used to support the issue of bid and performance bonds and guarantees 
each standby letter of credit issued under such line of credit is required to be fully collateralized by cash 
in the case of any standby letter of credit denominated in a foreign currency  the cash collateral requirement is of the us dollar equivalent of the foreign currency amount of the letter of credit 
as of december   we had utilized approximately million of the facility 
we had no material cash commitments as of december  other than to fund the payment for the purchase of the minority interest of detron for approximately million please see note of our consolidated financial statements on page

revenue recognition our principal sources of revenues consist of design and system deployment services 
we provide design services on a contract basis  usually in a customized plan for each client  and generally charge for engineering services on a time and materials or fixed price basis 
we generally offer deployment services on a fixed price  time certain basis 
the portion of our revenues from fixed price contracts was in and in we recognize revenues on fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion method 
with the percentage of completion method  expenses on each project are recognized as incurred  and revenues are recognized based on the ratio of the current costs incurred for the project to the then estimated total costs of the project 
we compare costs incurred to date against project milestones to determine if the percentage of completion is reasonable 
accordingly  revenues recognized in a given period depend on  among other things  the costs incurred on each individual project and our then current estimate of the total costs at completion for individual projects 
considerable judgment on the part of our management may be required in determining estimates to complete a project including the scope of the work to be completed  and reliance on the customer or other vendors to fulfill some task s 
if in any period we significantly increase the estimate of the total costs to complete a project  we may recognize very little or no additional revenues with respect to that project 
if total contract cost estimates increase  gross profit for any single project may be significantly reduced or eliminated 
if the total contract cost estimates indicate that there is a loss  the loss is recognized in the period the determination is made 
at december  and  respectively  we had million and million of unbilled receivables 
allowance for doubtful accounts the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
specifically  our management must make estimates of the probability of collection of accounts receivable 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable balances  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the valuation allowance for doubtful accounts 
for the years ended december  and  we derived and  respectively  of total revenues from our ten largest customers  indicating significant customer concentration risk with our receivables 
these ten largest customers constituted and of our net receivable balance as of december  and  respectively 
lastly  we frequently perform services for development stage customers  which carry a higher degree of risk  particularly as to the collection of accounts receivable 
these customers may be particularly vulnerable to the current tightening of available credit and general economic slowdown 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements an estimate for income taxes is required for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process requires estimating the actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenues  for tax accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which the deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event the actual results differ from these estimates  we may need to increase or decrease the valuation allowance  which could have a material impact on the financial position and results of operations 
considerable management judgment may be required in determining our provision for income taxes  the deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against the net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million and million as of december  and  respectively  due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of the deferred tax assets before they expire 
the additional valuation allowance we recorded on the deferred tax assets for the year ended december  was approximately million 
these deferred tax assets primarily consist of net operating losses and tax credits carried forward 
the net deferred tax assets as of december  and were million and million  respectively 
restructuring charge in we recorded restructuring charges of million 
included in these restructuring charges was a charge for excess facilities aggregating million 
this facility charge primarily relates to leased office space  which we no longer occupy 
the facility charge equals the existing lease obligation less anticipated rental receipts to be received from existing and potential subleases 
this requires significant judgments about the length of time the space will remain vacant  anticipated cost escalators and operating costs associated with the leases  the market rate at which the space will be subleased  the broker fees or other costs necessary to market the space 
these judgments were based upon independent market analysis and assessment from experienced real estate brokers 
the restructuring charge calculation assumes as of december  that we will receive million in sublease income  of which million is committed 
during the second quarter of  we adopted a restructuring plan and recorded a net restructuring charge of million 
included in the restructuring charge was million for severance related to the elimination of positions in corporate  north america and asia pacific 
an additional million was related to costs associated with closing affiliates and disposing of assets 
because we reoccupied some of the leased office space that had previously been included in the reserve for restructuring in a prior period  the reserve was reduced by million in the second quarter of in the fourth quarter  we reduced the restructuring reserve by approximately million due to a recovery of sublease income

recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued a revision of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 share based payment sfas no 
r 
this statement will require compensation costs related to share based payment transactions to be recognized in the financial statements 
sfas no 
r replaces fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
we currently account for share based compensation to employees using apb opinion s intrinsic value method and recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
upon our adoption of sfas r on january   we will begin recognizing an expense for unvested share based compensation that has been issued as of january  and equity instruments issued after that date 
the adoption of sfas no 
r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our results of operations and the classification of certain cash flows 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
r to have a significant impact on our financial position 
the ultimate impact of the adoption of sfas no 
r can not be predicted at this time because it will be dependent on levels of share based compensation granted in the future 
however  valuation of employee stock options under sfas no 
r is similar to sfas no 
with minor exceptions 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for pro forma disclosure of results of operations and earnings per share under the fair value method of sfas in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections sfas no 
which replaces accounting principles board opinion no 
accounting changes and sfas no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements an amendment of apb opinion no 

sfas applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle and to changes required by an accounting pronouncement in the unusual instance that the pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions 
it establishes retrospective application  or the latest practicable date  as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle 
sfas no 
is effective for accounting changes and correction of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  and  accordingly  is required to be adopted by us on january  we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
the exposure to exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign subsidiaries 
subsidiaries with material foreign currency exposure are in great britain  algeria and italy 
for our foreign subsidiaries  exchange rates can have an impact on the united states dollar value of their reported earnings and the intercompany transactions with the subsidiaries 
customers outside of the united states accounted for and of our revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in connection with the increased availability of g equipment in europe  we anticipate continued growth of our international operations  particularly in europe  the middle east and africa  in and beyond 
as a result  fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies against the united states dollar may have a significant impact on our reported results 
revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated monthly into united states dollars at the weighted average exchange rate 
consequently  as the value of the dollar strengthens or weakens relative to other currencies in our major markets the resulting translated revenues  expenses and operating profits become lower or higher  respectively 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates also can have an impact on the united states dollar amount of our shareholders equity 
the assets and liabilities of the non us subsidiaries are translated into united states dollars at the exchange rate in effect on the date of the balance sheet for the respective reporting period 
the resulting translation adjustments are recorded in shareholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss 
the euro and british pound were weaker relative to other foreign currencies at december   compared to december  consequently  the accumulated other comprehensive income component of shareholders equity decreased million during the year ended december  as of december   the net amount invested in non us subsidiaries subject to this equity adjustment  using the exchange rate as of the same date  was million 
we are exposed to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations due to the operations of short term intercompany transactions between the london office and its consolidated foreign subsidiaries and between the mclean office and its consolidated foreign subsidiaries 
while these intercompany balances are eliminated in consolidation  exchange rate changes do affect consolidated earnings 
foreign subsidiaries with amounts owed to or from the london operations at december  denominated in euros include italy in the amount of million and algeria in the amount of million 
foreign subsidiaries with amounts owed to or from the mclean operations at december  denominated in euros or british pounds include italy in the amount of million and the united kingdom in the amount of million 
these balances generated a foreign exchange loss of million included in our consolidated results at december  a hypothetical appreciation of the euro and british pound of would result in a million increase to our operating profits in generated outside the united states 
this was estimated using a appreciation factor to the average monthly exchange rates applied to net income or loss for each of our subsidiaries in the respective period 
foreign exchange gains and losses recognized on any transactions are included in our consolidated statements of operations 
although currency fluctuations can have an impact on our reported results and shareholders equity  such fluctuations can affect our cash flow and could result in economic gains or losses 
we currently do not hedge any of these risks in our foreign subsidiaries because i our subsidiaries generally earn revenues and incur expenses within a single country and  consequently  do not incur currency risks in connection with the conduct of their normal operations  ii other foreign operations are minimal  and iii we do not believe that hedging transactions are justified by the current exposure and cost at this time
