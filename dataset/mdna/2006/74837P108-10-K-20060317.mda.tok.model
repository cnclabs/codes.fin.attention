overview we operate in a single industry segment where we design and sell field programmable gate arrays  or fpgas  embedded standard products  or esps  associated software and programming hardware 
our fpga and esp devices are standard products that can be programmed to perform desired logic functions 
we design these devices based on our proprietary vialink technology 
we believe that the underlying attributes of our vialink technology  including low power consumption  high reliability  design security and design efficiency enable us to deliver differentiated silicon solutions to our customers 
our objective is to become the market leader in providing the lowest power programmable logic solutions 
we believe that our products provide our customers with the lowest power consumption  highest design security  and highest reliability of full featured fpga programmable logic products 
we believe these devices enable system manufacturers to meet their time to market  lower total power consumption and add features or performance to their embedded applications 
competitively  our products can offer significant power  performance  time to market  cost  and design security benefits when compared to traditional fpgas  lower cost of ownership  time to market and increased system flexibility benefits when compared to the use of application specific integrated circuits  or asics  and increased system flexibility  product differentiation and design security benefits when compared to application specific standard products  or assps 
we believe that developing products around our vialink technology will continue to allow us to provide products that address the design flexibility  system power  performance  intellectual property security and price points demanded by our target markets 
in  we introduced our first fpgas based upon our vialink technology 
our mature product family consists of our pasic  pasic and pasic products 
in september  we introduced our first embedded standard products  or esps  which are products that combine standard functions and programmable logic in a single device 
these products provide engineers with the ease of use  guaranteed functionality  high performance  low non recurring engineering charges and immediate availability of application specific standard products  or assps  combined with the flexibility and time to market advantages of programmable logic 
our esp product family includes quickram  quickpci  and v products 
our advanced esp product family includes eclipse products  as well as our new eclipse ii  quickpci ii  polarpro and quickmips products 
our new products target power sensitive and power critical applications where system designers want to minimize power consumption  add features to a system  improve the performance of a system and achieve a fast time to market 
in the fourth quarter of  we completed the design of our eclipse ii and quickpci ii product families and additions to our quickmips products 
we designed eclipse ii and quickpci ii to provide a low power solution for applications requiring medium to small amounts of programmable logic 
eclipse ii and quickpci ii devices are the lowest power fpga products available on the market today 
these devices offer the lowest power consumption during all phases of operation power up  quiescent and dynamic operation 
our polarpro architecture and related products were announced in november these products improve on our eclipse ii and quickpci ii low power leadership by providing lower power consumption and a more cost effective architecture 
our polarpro architecture combines the industry s lowest power fpga with embedded circuitry for implementing high bandwidth bus to bus interfaces 
all device circuitry is optimized for low power consumption through the new and innovative very low power mode  or vlp  which provides an instant ability to lower power consumption when the device function is not needed 
when put in vlp mode  we believe that our polarpro products draw less than micro amps of quiescent current 
polarpro products also exhibit the fpga industry s lowest dynamic power consumption  with operational power consumption up to three times lower than competing alternatives 
based on our engineering analysis of portable media players  we believe designers of handheld  battery powered products using polarpro products can now extend battery life by as much as four times as compared to a standard product implementation  setting a new standard for low power consumption through the use of fpgas 
our first polarpro product  the qlp  is currently being sampled and we expect it to be released for production by the second quarter of we expect to sample additional polarpro products during in addition to offering the lowest power  full featured fpgas  our products also provide high design security  small form factor  instant on and high reliability 
the low power consumption and high performance of our eclipse ii  quickpci ii and polarpro products is compelling in power critical and power sensitive applications such as handheld  battery powered  prosumer devices 
this compelling advantage is allowing us to engage with new customers in the portable electronics markets  including manufacturers of portable gps systems and personal video recorders 
we compete in various markets  including instrumentation and test  data communications and telecommunications  consumer  video  audio and graphics imaging  high performance computing  and military and aerospace systems 
based on current customer design activity  we expect that consumer applications will represent a higher proportion of our revenue in the future 
our proprietary vialink programmable metal to metal technology is the core of our fpga products and the foundation of our esp products 
our vialink technology allows us to create devices smaller than competitors comparable products  thereby minimizing silicon area and cost 
in addition  our vialink technology has lower electrical resistance and capacitance than other programmable technologies and  consequently  supports higher signal speed and low power consumption 
our user programmable platform facilitates full utilization of a device s logic cells  clocks and input output pins 
these logic cells have been optimized to efficiently implement a wide range of logic functions at high speed  thereby enabling greater usable device density and design flexibility 
our architecture uses our vialink technology to maximize interconnects at every routing wire intersection  which allows more paths between logic cells 
as a consequence  system designers are able to use our devices with smaller gate counts to implement their designs than if they had used competing fpgas 
the abundance of interconnect resources also provides a dense connection between the assp and the fpga portions of embedded standard products 
our vialink technology also provides our products with what we believe to be bulletproof intellectual property security  especially compared to sram based fpga or asic solutions 
we believe intellectual property security is important to system designers who choose to implement proprietary algorithms or features in programmable logic 
we believe that important industry trends in our target markets include lower power consumption  higher performance  shorter time to market  intellectual property security  higher asic development expenses and higher product development risks 
we believe our products are designed to address these trends 
the market for programmable logic devices is expected to grow more quickly than the semiconductor industry  and we believe the fpga programmable logic market will grow more quickly than the market for complex programmable logic devices  or cplds 
one factor fueling this high growth is the migration from asic circuit designs to programmable logic circuit designs 
system designers often choose programmable logic solutions over asic solutions  due to the relatively low development cost  low development risk  quick time to market and high adaptability or flexibility of programmable logic devices  and due to the ability of programmable logic suppliers to reduce the unit costs of their products over time 
within the programmable logic device market  we believe that the market for low power embedded applications will be a relatively high growth market  as original equipment manufacturers  or oems  serving the consumer or professional portable markets accelerate the offering of devices such as portable  d gps products incorporating micro hard drive capability or personal video recorders incorporating wi fi and a micro hard drive 
this adoption of new features by embedded system designers is increasing the use of programmable logic  since embedded processors often do not have the native ability to interface to components such as wi fi modules or micro hard disk drives  which were designed to work in a personal computer environment 
our eclipse ii  quickpci ii and polarpro products offer compelling advantages in these programmable interconnect applications  where customers benefit from their low power consumption  small form factor and high bandwidth 
in  we entered into a share purchase agreement  foundry agreement and other related agreements  as amended  with tower 
under the terms of the agreements  we agreed to make a strategic investment of up to million in tower as part of tower s plan to build and equip a new wafer fabrication facility 
the facility produces mm wafers in geometries of micron  using advanced complementary metal oxide semiconductor  or cmos  technology acquired from toshiba 
during and  we paid tower a total of million to fulfill our investment requirements under the terms of the agreement 
in partial consideration for the investment  we received  tower ordinary shares with an original cost of million 
we wrote down the tower shares due to an other than temporary decline in their market value by million  million  million and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
the cumulative effect of these write downs is that the adjusted cost of our tower ordinary shares is per share or million 
during fiscal  we sold  of the available for sale tower ordinary shares for total proceeds of approximately million and recognized a gain in the amount of  as of december   we held  available for sale tower ordinary shares valued at per share  the market value of these shares at the end of we intend to continue to hold  tower ordinary shares in order to receive competitive product pricing and  accordingly  have classified these shares as a long term investment on our balance sheets 
the remaining  shares are recorded as a short term investment on our balance sheets 
we also received million in prepaid wafer credits in partial consideration for the investment  million of which remained available as of december  the credits have no stated maturity and we have guaranteed capacity at tower through at least these credits are recorded within long term other assets on the balance sheets and can be applied toward wafer purchases from tower at of the value of future purchases 
we sell programmed and unprogrammed products through distributors and directly to system manufacturers 
we recognize revenue at the time of shipment of products directly to system manufacturers 
however  we sell the majority of our products through distributors who earn a negotiated margin on the sale of our products 
we defer recognition of revenue from sales of unprogrammed products to distributors until after they have sold our products to systems manufacturers 
we recognize revenue on programmed products at the time of shipment to our distributors 
during and  approximately and  respectively  of the units shipped to our distributors were programmed by us and  accordingly  are not returnable 
the percentage of sales derived through distributors was  and in  and  respectively 
the percentage of sales derived through direct sales was  and in   and  respectively 
two distributors of our products accounted for and of revenue in three distributors of our products accounted for  and of revenue in three distributors of our products accounted for  and of revenue in one us based instrumentation and test customer  honeywell  accounted for of revenue in  which included significant purchases of pasic and pasic products under our end of life program 
one chinese systems manufacturer  purchasing our products through a distributor  accounted for percent of revenue in we anticipate that a limited number of distributors and customers will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue and that individual distributors could account for a larger portion of our revenue 
our international sales were  and of revenue in  and  respectively 
revenue from sales to international customers is expected to continue to represent a significant portion of our revenue 
all of our sales originate in the united states and are denominated in us dollars 
we outsource the wafer manufacturing  assembly and test of all of our products 
we currently rely upon taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company ltd  or tsmc  cypress semiconductor corporation  tower  kawasaki microelectronics  inc and samsung semiconductor  inc 
to manufacture our products  and we rely primarily upon amkor technology  inc to assemble  test and program our products 
our wafer suppliers lead times are often as long as three months and sometimes longer 
in addition  tower requires us to provide them with a monthly wafer start forecast 
under the terms of our agreement with them  we are limited in the quantity that we can increase or decrease our wafer forecast and we are committed to take delivery of and pay for a minimum portion of the forecasted wafer volume 
our long manufacturing cycle times are at odds with our customers desire for short delivery lead times and  as a result  we typically purchase wafers based on our internal forecasts of customer demand 
critical accounting policies and estimates the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements 
the us securities and exchange commission  or sec  has defined critical accounting policies as those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
based on this definition  our critical policies include revenue recognition including sales returns and allowances  inventory valuation including identification of excess quantities and product obsolescence  allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation of investments  valuation of long lived assets  accounting for income taxes  and estimating accrued liabilities 
we believe that we apply judgments and estimates in a consistent manner and that such consistent application results in financial statements and accompanying notes that fairly represent all periods presented 
however  any factual errors or errors in these judgments and estimates may have a material impact on our statement of operations and financial condition 
revenue recognition we supply standard products which must be programmed before they can be used in an application 
our products may be programmed by us  distributors  end customers or third parties 
once programmed  our parts cannot be erased and  therefore  programmed parts are only useful to a specific customer 
we generally recognize revenue as products are shipped if evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured  and product returns are reasonably estimable 
revenue is recognized upon shipment to oem customers  for both programmed and unprogrammed parts  provided that legal title and risk of ownership have transferred 
we also sell to distributors under agreements that allow for price adjustments and  in the case of unprogrammed parts  certain rights of return on unsold inventory 
because programmed parts can only be used by a specific customer  it is our practice to agree upon any price adjustments with a distributor prior to shipment 
furthermore  distributors are not allowed any future price adjustments and have no rights of return on programmed parts 
accordingly  revenue is recognized upon delivery to a distributor since title and risk of ownership have transferred to the distributor  the price is fixed  no right of return exists  and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
unprogrammed parts shipped to distributors may be used by multiple end customers and distributors may have certain return and price adjustment privileges on unsold inventory 
accordingly  revenue of unprogrammed parts is deferred until resale to the end customer 
software revenue from sales of design tools is recognized when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery of the software has occurred  no significant obligations with regard to implementation or integration remain  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
software revenue amounted to less than one percent of our revenue for fiscal  and inventory valuation we value our inventory at the lower of standard cost or net realizable value 
standard cost approximates actual cost on a first in first out basis 
manufacturing overhead is included in product costs based on capacity 
we routinely evaluate the value and quantities of our inventory in light of current market conditions and market trends 
our analysis may take into consideration historic usage  expected demand  anticipated sales price  new product development schedules  the effect new products might have on sales of existing products  product obsolescence  customer design activity  customer concentrations  product merchantability and other factors 
market conditions are subject to change and actual consumption of our inventory may differ from expected demand 
during the introduction of a new product  we may begin production of products that have not been qualified and we may experience yields that are lower than anticipated 
such factors may be material to our financial statements 
historically  the lives of our products are unusually long and obsolescence has not been a significant factor in the valuation of our inventories 
as a result of our evaluations  we have recorded reserves for quantities in excess of demand  cost in excess of market value  and product obsolescence 
we recorded charges against inventory of   and million in  and  respectively 
these charges were recorded primarily due to quantities in excess of expected demand 
estimating allowance for doubtful accounts we estimate uncollectible accounts receivable at each reporting period 
in specific  we analyze the aging of accounts receivable and also bad debt history  payment history  customer concentration  customer credit worthiness  and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
our accounts receivable balance was million  net of the allowance for doubtful accounts of million  as of december  valuation of investments at december   we held  available for sale tower ordinary shares valued at approximately million  of which approximately million was recorded as a short term investment 
the market value of these shares was per share at december  the available for sale securities are marked to market on our balance sheets at the end of each reporting period 
these changes are also reflected in our consolidated statement of comprehensive income 
if the market value of the available for sale shares changes during a reporting period  we record comprehensive gain or loss in the equity section of the balance sheets and we increase or decrease the value of the shares on our balance sheets 
if the market value of the shares were to decline below the adjusted cost and if the decline is determined to be other than temporary  we would record a write down of marketable securities as a charge to our statement of operations and reduce the adjusted cost of the shares 
during   and  we wrote down the value of our tower shares due to declines in value that we determined to be other than temporary 
this determination included factors such as market value and the period of time that the market value had been below the adjusted cost 
the tower shares purchased in were obtained at an average price of per share 
in  we wrote down the cost of these shares by million  or to per share  based on the market price of tower s stock at that time 
the tower shares we purchased in were obtained at an average price of per share 
at december   all tower shares held by us were written down by million  or to per share  based on the market price of tower s stock at the end of our fiscal year 
at december   all tower shares held by us were written down by million  or to per share  based on the market price of tower s stock at the end of our fiscal year 
at june   all tower shares held by us were written down by million  or to an adjusted cost of per share  based on the market price of tower s stock at the end of our fiscal quarter 
as of december   we held  available for sale tower ordinary shares with an unrealized gain of  recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income  representing the difference between the adjusted cost per share and per share  their market value on the last trading day of the reporting period 
a decline in the market value of the tower shares would have approximately a  effect on the market value of the shares 
valuation of long lived assets we assess whether the value of identifiable intangibles and long lived assets  including property and equipment and prepaid wafer credits  has been impaired annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant under performance relative to historical or projected future revenue and operating results  significant changes in expected demand for the related products  significant changes in the manner of our use of or the expected cash flow from the assets  significant changes in the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative economic events or trends affecting our business 
our assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of an asset or asset group from their expected future pre tax cash flows  undiscounted and without interest charges  of the related operations 
if these cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset or asset group  we recognize an impairment loss for the difference between estimated fair value and carrying value  and the carrying value of the related assets is reduced by this difference 
the measurement of impairment requires management to estimate future cash flows and the fair value of long lived assets 
during the fourth quarter of  we evaluated the revenue potential of our products based upon discussions with potential customers  consultations with external advisors  review of actual sales levels and analysis of current and future design opportunities 
based upon this evaluation  we determined that the future revenue outlook for our quickmips products was lower than previously expected 
accordingly  we performed an impairment assessment on the long lived assets associated with these products 
our preliminary assessment  based upon undiscounted cash flows  indicated that these assets were impaired 
in order to determine the fair value of these assets  we performed a probability weighted assessment of the revenue and related cash flows  discounted using a risk free interest rate 
based upon this assessment  we recognized a million long lived asset impairment as an operating expense  which was allocated to the related long lived assets on a pro rata basis using the carrying value of the assets immediately before the impairment charge 
this million charge reduced the net carrying value of our property and equipment by million and our other long term assets by million 
this write down did not affect the carrying value of related inventory 
during  and  we wrote off long lived assets with a net book value of   and  respectively  related to assets identified as having no future value to our operations 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from different tax and accounting treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  allowance for doubtful accounts  depreciation and amortization and employee related accruals 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included on our balance sheets 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
our deferred tax assets  consisting primarily of net operating loss carryforwards  amounted to million as of december  we have also recorded a valuation allowance of million as of december  due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on the uncertainty of our estimates of taxable income and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
these carryforwards  if not utilized to offset future taxable income and income taxes payable  will expire beginning in for federal and state purposes 
estimating accrued liabilities we review our accounts payable and accrued liabilities at each reporting period  and accrue liabilities as appropriate 
during this analysis we consider items such as manufacturing activity  commitments made to or the level of activity with vendors  payroll and employee related costs  historic spending  budgeted spending  and anticipated changes in the cost of services

interest expense interest income and other  net income loss before income taxes provision for income taxes net income loss comparison of fiscal years ended december  and revenue 
our revenue for and was million and million  respectively  representing a growth of million or from to the revenue increase was due to a million increase in our mature product family revenue  primarily related to end of life purchases of our pasic products and higher customer demand  and a million increase in advanced esp product family revenue  due to a million increase in sales of our new eclipse ii  quickpci ii and quickmips products  partially offset by a decline in eclipse sales from a japanese customer purchasing through a distributor 
these increases in revenue were partially offset by a million decline in our esp product family revenue  primarily due to changes in customer demand 
our combined esp and advanced esp products contributed and of our revenue in and  respectively 
our foundry agreement with the supplier that fabricates our pasic and pasic products expired at the end of we previously announced an end of life for these products and asked our customers to take delivery of lifetime buy orders before the end of these products contributed million and million of our revenue in and  respectively 
we currently believe that a majority of our customers that use pasic and pasic products have purchased enough product to satisfy their demand throughout the expected life of their products 
while we have limited production capacity for these products beyond  we experienced a significant reduction in pasic and pasic revenue near the end of further  we believe pasic and pasic products will contribute less than of our revenue by the second quarter of and we expect that these products will contribute no revenue in the third quarter of in order to maintain or grow our revenue from its current level after the end of life period for our pasic and pasic products  we are dependent upon increased revenue from our existing products  especially our eclipse ii and quickpci ii products  and the development of additional new products such as polarpro 
we continue to seek to expand our revenue  including the pursuit of high volume sales opportunities in the consumer market segment  by providing low power solutions incorporating industry standards such as pci or ide 
our industry is characterized by intense price competition and by lower prices as order volumes increase 
while winning large volume sales opportunities will increase our revenue  we believe these opportunities may decrease our average selling price and gross profit as a percentage of revenue 
gross profit 
gross profit was million and million in and  respectively  which was and of revenue for those periods 
the million improvement in gross profit in was primarily due to higher revenue and better product mix  which contributed approximately million of this improvement  production variances improved by approximately million  as our costs included significant yield variances associated with the initial production of our new products at tower  lower inventory reserves and adverse purchase commitments of  which was due primarily to one time charges totaling  in related to wafers of one product not expected to yield usable die  and lower unabsorbed overhead of approximately  which was due primarily to lower depreciation and amortization expense of  our lower depreciation and amortization expense was largely a result of the impairment of long lived assets recorded in the fourth quarter of the sale of previously reserved inventory reduced our cost of revenue by million and million in and  respectively 
research and development expense 
research and development expense was million and million in and  respectively  which represented and of revenue for those periods 
the decrease of approximately million in was primarily due to million of lower charges for pre production material and other expenses associated with the development of our new products and  of lower depreciation expense  partially offset by higher consulting expenses of  for the design our next generation products 
during  new product expenses were primarily associated with our eclipse ii  quickpci ii and quickmips products 
during  these expenses were primarily associated with polarpro and other new products 
we believe that continued or increased investments in product development and process technology are essential for us to remain competitive in the markets we serve 
we expect that these development efforts will allow us to expand our product offering and provide additional value to our customers and stockholders 
selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expense was million and million in and  respectively  which represented and of revenue for those periods 
sg a expense increased on a dollar basis in as compared to while declining as a percentage of revenue due to the proportionately greater increase in revenue during the  annual increase in sg a expense was primarily the result of higher salaries and personnel costs of  higher legal expenses of  due to collection efforts  compliance activities and the filing of a shelf registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission  higher commissions to independent sales representatives of  due to higher revenue amounts  and board of director fees of  long lived asset impairment charge 
during the fourth quarter of  we evaluated the revenue potential of our products based upon discussions with potential customers  consultations with external advisors  review of actual sales levels and analysis of current and future design opportunities 
based upon this evaluation  we determined that the future revenue outlook for our quickmips products was lower than previously expected 
accordingly  we performed an impairment assessment on the long lived assets associated with these products 
our preliminary assessment  based upon undiscounted cash flows  indicated that these assets were impaired 
in order to determine the fair value of these assets  we performed a probability weighted assessment of the revenue and related cash flows  discounted using a risk free interest rate 
based upon this assessment  we recognized a million long lived asset impairment as an operating expense  which was allocated to the related long lived assets on a pro rata basis using the carrying value of the assets immediately before the impairment charge 
this million charge reduced the net carrying value of our property and equipment by million and our other long term assets by million 
this write down did not affect the carrying value of related inventory 
write down of marketable securities 
in the second quarter of and the fourth quarter of  we determined that our investment in tower stock had suffered a decline in value that was determined to be other than temporary and recorded impairment charges of million and million  respectively 
the impairment charges were recorded for the difference between our adjusted cost and the quoted market price of the stock on the last trading day of the reporting period 
as a result of these write downs  the adjusted cost of our tower ordinary shares was million  or per share  as of december  the market value of our investment in tower stock as of december  was million  or per share  based on the quoted market price of the stock on the last trading day of the fiscal year 
the  difference between the adjusted cost and the market value was recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income on the balance sheets at december  interest expense 
interest expense declined to  in as compared to  in this  decrease was primarily due to lower average outstanding debt balances 
interest income and other  net 
interest income and other  net  consists primarily of interest income on invested cash  foreign exchange gains and losses  and other tax expense 
interest income and other  net  increased to income of  in as compared to income of  in the  increase in interest income and other  net is primarily due to increased interest income received as a result of higher invested cash balances and higher interest rates  partially offset by foreign exchange rate losses 
provision for income taxes 
we recorded a provision for income taxes of  in  which consisted primarily of income taxes on foreign operations 
no provision for income taxes was recorded in due to our pretax losses 
our ability to utilize our income tax loss carryforwards in future periods is uncertain and  accordingly  we recorded a full valuation allowance against the related tax benefit 
we will continue to assess the realizability of the deferred tax assets in future periods 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state tax purposes of approximately million and million  respectively 
these carryforwards  if not utilized to offset future taxable income and income taxes payable  will expire beginning in for federal and state purposes 
we recorded net income of million in as compared to a net loss of million in this million improvement is primarily due to five factors higher revenue of million  higher gross profit of million due to the revenue increase and due to a improvement in gross margin as a percent of revenue  a million reduction in operating expenses attributable to research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses  the absence of charges for long lived asset impairment  which accounted for million of operating expenses  and interest and other income  net  which improved by  as compared to comparison of fiscal years ended december  and revenue 
our revenue for and was million and million  respectively  representing a growth of million or from to the revenue increase was primarily due to increased sales volume of our pasic  pasic  eclipse and pasic products  which increased by million  million  million  and  respectively 
the increase in our pasic and pasic product revenue was due to increased customer demand and end of life purchases 
these increases in revenue were partially offset by a million decline in sales of our quickram products  which benefited in from sales to one customer in china 
this customer  purchasing products through a distributor  accounted for of our revenue in as compared to of revenue in our combined esp and advanced esp products contributed and of our revenue in and  respectively 
our foundry agreement with the supplier that fabricates our pasic and pasic products expired at the end of we previously announced an end of life for these products and have asked our customers to take delivery of lifetime buy orders before the end of these product families contributed million and million of our revenue in and  respectively 
gross profit 
gross profit was million and million in and  respectively  which was and of revenue for those periods 
the million improvement in gross profit in was primarily due to changes in product mix and lower product costs which contributed to improved gross profit by approximately million  higher revenue which contributed to improved gross profit by approximately million  and lower additions to the excess and obsolete inventory reserve of  this was partially offset by higher unfavorable yield and other manufacturing variances of  primarily due to initial production of our new products  one time charges totaling  related to wafers of one product not expected to yield usable die  and higher unabsorbed overhead of  in and  charges to inventory reserves were  and million  respectively 
the sale of previously reserved inventory reduced our cost of sales by million and million in and  respectively 
research and development expense 
research and development expense was million and million in and  respectively  which represented and of revenue for those periods 
the increase of approximately million in was primarily due to an increase of  in outside services and an increase of  for equipment and supplies  which were incurred primarily to bring our new eclipse ii and quickmips products to production in in and  research and development expense included  and  for the write off of long lived assets  respectively  primarily related to design software that is no longer in use 
other research and development expenses increased by approximately  during selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expense was million and million in and  respectively  which represented and of revenue for those periods 
sg a expense remained relatively unchanged on a dollar basis in as compared to while declining as a percentage of revenue due to the proportionately greater increase in revenue during the  increase in sg a expense in as compared to was primarily the result of a million increase in consulting and auditing expenses related to sarbanes oxley compliance matters and a computer software upgrade  partially offset by a decrease of  in additions to our allowance for doubtful accounts  a decrease of  in depreciation expense and a decrease of  in salary related expenses 
long lived asset impairment charge 
during the fourth quarter of  we evaluated the revenue potential of our products based upon discussions with potential customers  consultations with external advisors  review of actual sales levels and analysis of current and future design opportunities 
based upon this evaluation  we determined that the future revenue outlook for the quickmips products was lower than previously expected 
accordingly  we performed an impairment assessment on the long lived assets associated with these products 
our preliminary assessment  based upon undiscounted cash flows  indicated that these assets were impaired 
in order to determine the fair value of these assets  we performed a probability weighted assessment of the revenue and related cash flows  discounted using a risk free interest rate 
based upon this assessment  we recognized a million long lived asset impairment as an operating expense  which was allocated to the related long lived assets on a pro rata basis using the carrying value of the assets immediately before the impairment charge 
this million charge reduced the net carrying value of our property and equipment by million and our other long term assets by million 
this write down did not affect the carrying value of related inventory 
deferred compensation 
as a result of granting stock options to employees prior to our initial public offering at below market value  we recorded aggregate deferred compensation of  in no deferred compensation has been recorded as a result of stock option grants to employees since deferred compensation is presented as a reduction of stockholders equity and amortized ratably over the vesting period of the applicable options  generally four years 
we amortized  in and as of december  we had fully amortized these expenses 
the amortization of deferred compensation is recorded as research and development and sg a expenses  depending on the related employees activities 
write down of marketable securities 
during  we determined that our investment in tower stock had suffered a decline in value that was determined to be other than temporary 
this determination included factors such as market value and the period of time that the market value had been below the adjusted cost 
accordingly  we recorded an impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of based on the quoted market price of the stock on the last day of the reporting period 
as a result of this write down  the adjusted cost of our tower ordinary shares was per share at the end of fiscal  compared to per share at the end of fiscal unrealized income on available for sale tower ordinary shares included within stockholders equity was million at december  gain on sale of investment in tower semiconductor ltd 
in  we sold  available for sale tower ordinary shares for total proceeds of approximately million and recognized a gain in the amount of  interest expense 
interest expense was  in as compared to  in this increase was primarily due to higher interest rates 
interest income and other  net 
interest income and other  net  includes interest income on invested cash  foreign exchange gains and losses  and other tax expense 
interest income and other  net  was income of  in as compared to income of  in the  improvement in interest income and other  net is primarily due to increased interest received as a result of higher invested average cash balances and higher interest rates 
provision for income taxes 
in and  we incurred tax losses 
however  our ability to utilize these losses in future periods is uncertain and  accordingly  we recorded a full valuation allowance against the related tax benefit 
as such  no provision for federal or state income taxes was recorded for and our net loss increased to million in from million in this million increase is primarily attributable to charges for long lived asset impairment of million and the write down of marketable securities of million that we did not incur in during  we recorded  of gains on the sale of tower shares 
during  our million increase in revenue and million improvement in gross profit were partially offset by an increase of million in combined research and development and sg a expenses 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operating losses and capital investments through sales of common stock  private equity investments  capital and operating leases  bank lines of credit and cash flow from operations 
as of december   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of our cash and cash equivalents of million  available credit under our revolving line of credit with silicon valley bank of approximately million  available credit under our equipment line of credit of approximately million  and our investment in tower with a market value of approximately million 
as of december   our interest bearing debt consisted of million outstanding from silicon valley bank and million outstanding under a capital lease to acquire electronic design automation software and related maintenance 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was million 
capital expenditures  which are largely driven by the development of new products and manufacturing levels  could be up to million in the next twelve months 
in june  we modified our amended and restated loan and security agreement with silicon valley bank 
terms of the modified agreement include an million revolving line of credit available through june and an additional million of borrowing capacity under an equipment financing line of credit that is available to be drawn against through june the revolving line of credit provides for formula advances based upon a percentage of eligible accounts receivable and for non formula advances not to exceed million 
as of december   we had no balances outstanding under the revolving line of credit and had available formula and non formula advances totaling million 
as of december   we had million outstanding under previous equipment lines of credit and million available to be drawn against future equipment purchases 
advances under the new equipment line of credit must be repaid in either or equal monthly installments  depending upon the nature of the items financed 
the bank has a first priority security interest on substantially all of our tangible and intangible assets to secure any outstanding amounts under the modified agreement 
under the terms of the modified agreement  we must maintain a minimum tangible net worth and an adjusted quick ratio 
the modified agreement also has certain restrictions including  among others  the incurrence of other indebtedness  the maintenance of depository accounts  the disposition of assets  mergers  acquisitions  the granting of liens and the payment of dividends 
we were in compliance with all loan covenants as of december  as of december   we also had million outstanding under a capital lease obligation to finance electronic design automation software and related maintenance 
the capital lease obligation has an imputed interest rate of per annum and is being repaid in quarterly amounts of  through november net cash from operating activities in and  net cash provided by operating activities was million and  respectively 
the cash provided by operating activities resulted from net income of million  adjusted for non cash charges including depreciation and amortization of million  a million write down of marketable securities related to the decline in market value of our tower shares  and reserves for excess and obsolete inventory in the amount of  in addition  changes in working capital accounts used cash of million as a result of increased inventory of million due to the purchase of new product die and an increase in work in process inventory to fulfill customer demand  a decrease in accounts payable of  due to the timing of expenditures and inventory purchases at the at the end of each period and a  increase in accounts receivable due to a higher proportion of oem shipments during the last quarter of these cash uses were partially offset by cash provided by higher accrued liabilities of  due primarily to employee related accruals  lower other assets of  due primarily to lower prepaid maintenance and insurance expenses  and higher deferred income and royalty revenue of in  net cash provided by operating activities was  and resulted from a net loss of million  adjusted for non cash charges including depreciation and amortization of million  million of charges to cost of sales and operating expenses against long lived assets related primarily to the long lived asset impairment associated with our quickmips products  a million write down of marketable securities related to the decline in market value of our tower shares  and reserves for excess and obsolete inventory in the amount of  in addition  changes in working capital accounts used cash of  primarily as a result of increased inventories of million due to higher sales levels  build up of inventory in anticipation of pasic and pasic end of life purchases and the introduction of new products and a  increase in accounts receivable due to the timing of shipments within the last quarter of each year 
these cash uses were partially offset by higher accounts payable  accrued liabilities  deferred income and other obligations of million due to higher manufacturing volumes and inventory levels and lower other assets of  due primarily to lower prepaid expenses 
in  net cash provided by operating activities was million and resulted from a net loss of million  adjusted for non cash charges and other items including depreciation and amortization of million  reserves for excess inventory in the amount of million   for the write off of long lived assets related to specific products that are not expected to achieve volume production and software that is no longer used in the development of our products  gains on the sale of tower shares of  and amortization of deferred compensation costs of  in addition  changes in working capital accounts provided cash of million primarily as a result of lower inventories of million due to higher sales levels and a reduction in the number of weeks of inventory on hand for several products  lower other assets of million due primarily to lower prepaid expenses and the termination of our deferred compensation plan  lower accounts receivable of million due to improved collection efforts  higher accounts payable of  due to higher manufacturing volumes and higher deferred income and royalty revenue of  these sources of operating cash were partially offset by a decrease of  in accrued liabilities primarily due to the termination of the deferred compensation plan 
net cash from investing activities in and  net cash used for investing activities was million and million  respectively  and resulted from capital expenditures that were primarily for software and equipment to develop and produce our new products 
in  net cash provided by investing activities was  we received million from the sale of  tower shares and spent million for capital expenditures 
the capital expenditures were primarily for software and equipment to develop and produce our new products 
net cash from financing activities in  net cash used for financing activities was  the primary use of these funds was to reduce our long term and revolving debt  net of new borrowings  by million 
this was partially offset by million of proceeds from the issuance of common shares under our employee stock purchase program and upon the exercise of stock options by employees 
in  net cash used for financing activities was  the primary use of these funds was to reduce our long term and revolving debt  net of new borrowings  by million 
this was partially offset by million of proceeds from the issuance of common shares under our employee stock purchase program and upon the exercise of stock options by employees 
in  net cash provided by financing activities was million 
the primary source of these funds was the reclassification of million of restricted cash to cash and cash equivalents based upon the terms of an amended and restated silicon valley bank credit facility 
in addition  we received million from the issuance of common shares under our employee stock purchase program and upon the exercise of stock options by employees  and we used million to reduce our long term and revolving debt  net of new borrowings 
we require substantial working capital to fund our business  particularly to finance our operations  the acquisition of property and equipment  working capital and the repayment of debt 
our future liquidity will depend on many factors such as these  as well as our level of revenue and gross profit  market acceptance of our existing and new products  the expected decline in revenue from our pasic and pasic products  wafer purchase commitments  the amount and timing of research and development expenditures  the timing of new product introductions  production volumes  the quality of our products  sales and marketing efforts  our ability to obtain debt financing and to remain in compliance with the terms of our credit facilities  our ability to raise funds from the sale of tower shares and equity in the company  the exercise of employee stock options and participation in our employee stock purchase plan  and other factors related to the uncertainties of the industry and global economics 
however  we believe that our existing cash resources will be sufficient to fund any operating losses  capital expenditures of up to million  and provide adequate working capital for the next twelve months 
as our liquidity is affected by many factors as mentioned above and as discussed in our risk factors  there can be no assurance that we will not seek additional capital during the next twelve months or that such capital will be available on terms acceptable to us 
after the next twelve months  our capital and operating requirements will depend on many factors  including our level of revenue and gross profit  the market acceptance of our new products  the levels at which we maintain inventory and accounts receivable  costs of securing access to adequate manufacturing capacity  new product development efforts  capital expenditures and the level of our operating expenses 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  and the effect such obligations and commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years contractual cash obligations operating leases wafer purchases other purchase commitments total contractual cash obligations other commercial commitments notes payable to bank capital lease obligations total commercial commitments total contractual obligations and commercial commitments certain of our wafer manufacturers require us to forecast wafer starts several months in advance

recently issued accounting pronouncements on december   the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
r  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
and supersedes accounting principals board  or apb  opinion no 
sfas no 
r requires any share based payments  or sbps  to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be valued at fair value on the date of grant  and to be expensed over the applicable vesting period 
pro forma disclosure of the income statement effects of share based payments is no longer an alternative 
sfas no 
r  as amended  is effective for all stock based awards granted in fiscal years beginning after june  in addition  companies must also recognize compensation expense related to any awards that are not fully vested as of the effective date 
compensation expense for the unvested awards will be measured based on the fair value of the awards previously calculated in developing the pro forma disclosures in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
see notes and to our consolidated financial statements for information related to the pro forma effects on our reported net income loss and net income loss per share of applying the fair value recognition provisions of the previous sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to stock based employee compensation 
we are currently assessing the impact of adopting sfas no 
r and related fasb staff positions fsps and expect the impact upon adoption in fiscal year to be significant to our results of operations 
on march   the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 which provides guidance on the interaction between sfas no 
r  shared based payment  and certain sec rules and regulations 
sab no 
provides guidance that may simplify some of the sfas no 
r implementation challenges and enhances the information that investors receive 
we will apply the principles of sab no 
in conjunction with the adoption of sfas no 
r 
in may  as part of a broader attempt to eliminate differences between the international accounting standards board and generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  which replaces apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and fasb sfas no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
apb had required that changes in accounting principles be recognized by including the cumulative effect of the change in the period in which the new accounting principle was adopted 
sfas no 
requires retrospective application of the change to prior periods financial statements  unless it is impracticable to determine the period specific effects of the change 
the statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material effect on our financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued eitf issue no 
 accounting for purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty eitf 
the issue provided guidance on the circumstances under which two or more inventory transactions with the same counterparty should be viewed as a single nonmonetary transaction within the scope of apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions 
the issue also provided guidance on circumstances under which nonmonetary exchanges of inventory within the same line of business should be recognized at fair value 
eitf will be effective for transactions completed in reporting periods beginning after march  we are evaluating the impact that this issue will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued fsp fas and fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments fsp and  which clarifies when an investment is considered impaired  whether the impairment is other than temporary  and the measurement of an impairment loss 
it also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other than temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other than temporary impairments 
fsp and are effective for all reporting periods beginning after december  at december   we had no unrealized investment losses that had not been recognized as other than temporary impairments in our available for sale securities 
we do not anticipate that the implementation of these statements will have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and variable rate debt 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk 
we are adverse to principal loss and ensure the safety and preservation of invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
our investment portfolio is generally comprised of investments that meet high credit quality standards 
since these securities are subject to interest rate risk  they could decline in value if interest rates fluctuate 
due to the short duration and conservative nature of our investment portfolio  we do not anticipate any material loss with respect to our investment portfolio 
a move in interest rates as of december  would have an immaterial effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
foreign currency exchange rate risk all of our sales and cost of manufacturing are transacted in us dollars 
we conducted a portion of our research and development activities in canada and india and have sales and marketing offices in several locations outside of the united states 
we use the us dollar as our functional currency 
most of the costs incurred at these international locations are in local currency 
if these local currencies strengthen against the us dollar  our payroll and other local expenses will be higher than we currently anticipate 
since our sales are transacted in us dollars  this negative impact on expenses would not be offset by any positive effect on revenue 
operating expenses denominated in foreign currencies were approximately  and of total operating expenses in  and  respectively 
a majority of these foreign expenses were incurred in canada 
a currency exchange rate fluctuation of would have caused our operating expenses to change by approximately  in the year ended december  equity price risk our exposure to equity price risk for changes in market value relates primarily to our investment in tower semiconductor ltd  or tower 
tower s ordinary shares trade on the nasdaq national market under the symbol tsem 
since these securities are publicly traded on the open market  they are subject to market fluctuations 
temporary market fluctuations are reflected by increasing or decreasing the presented value of the related securities and recording other comprehensive income loss in the equity section of the balance sheet 
an other than temporary decline in market value is reflected by decreasing the cost of the related securities and recording a charge to operating expenses on the income statement 
we wrote down the tower shares due to an other than temporary decline in their market value by million  million  million and million   and  respectively the determination that the decline in market value was other than temporary included factors such as market value and the period of time that the market value had been below the adjusted cost in each of the respective periods 
a decline in the market value of tower shares as of december   would have caused us to reduce accumulated other comprehensive income by approximately  in the year ended december
