item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for further discussion 
because of the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system  misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 
in addition  as described in greater detail in part ii item a controls and procedures  management has excluded from its assessment of internal controls certain elements of the internal control over financial reporting for those parts of its business that were acquired via the purchase of oasis 
although the company s management has concluded that its system of internal controls over financial reporting was effective as of february   there can be no assurance that the company or its independent registered public accounting firm will not identify a material weakness in the system of internal controls over financial reporting in the future 
a material weakness in the company s system of internal controls over financial reporting would require management and the company s independent registered public accounting firm to evaluate the company s system of internal controls as ineffective 
this in turn could lead to a loss of public confidence  which could adversely affect the company s business and the price of its common stock 
corporate governance in recent years  the nasdaq national market  on which the company s common stock is listed  has adopted comprehensive rules and regulations relating to corporate governance 
these laws  rules and regulations have increased  and may continue to increase  the scope  complexity and cost of the company s corporate governance  reporting and disclosure practices 
failure to comply with these rules and regulations could adversely affect the company  and in a worst case  result in the delisting of its stock 
as a result of these rules  the company s board members  chief executive officer  chief financial officer and other corporate officers could also face increased risks of personal liability in connection with the performance of their duties 
as a result  the company may have difficulty attracting and retaining qualified board members and officers  which would adversely affect its business 
further  these developments could affect the company s ability to secure desired levels of directors and officers liability insurance  requiring the company to accept reduced insurance coverage or to incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage 
changes in accounting for equity compensation the company has historically used stock options as a key component of employee compensation in order to align employees interests with the interests of its stockholders  encourage employee retention  and provide competitive compensation packages 
the financial accounting standards board fasb has recently adopted changes to generally accepted accounting principles known as statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment revised sfas r that will require a charge to earnings for employee stock option grants and other equity incentives beginning in the first quarter of fiscal to the extent that this or other new regulations make it more difficult or expensive to grant options to employees  the company may incur increased compensation costs 
the company may also consider changes to its equity compensation strategy and find it more difficult to attract  retain and motivate employees 
any of these results could materially and adversely affect the company s business 
environmental regulation environmental regulations and standards are established worldwide to control discharges  emissions  and solid wastes from manufacturing processes

the company will not renew its hauppauge  new york facility lease  but does expect to renew the lease on its munich  germany and tokyo  japan offices 
it is not certain whether the company will negotiate new leases on its other facilities as existing leases expire 
such determinations will be made as existing leases approach expiration and will be based on an assessment of requirements and market conditions at that time 
further  management believes that additional space can be obtained  if necessary  based on prior experience and current and expected real estate market conditions 
item legal proceedings from time to time as a normal consequence of doing business  various claims and litigation may be asserted or commenced against the company 
in particular  the company in the ordinary course of business may receive claims that its products infringe the intellectual property of third parties  or that customers have suffered damage as a result of defective products allegedly supplied by the company 
due to uncertainties inherent in litigation and other claims  the company can give no assurance that it will prevail in any such matters  which could subject the company to significant liability for damages and or invalidate its proprietary rights 
any lawsuits  regardless of their success  would likely be time consuming and expensive to resolve and would divert management s time and attention  and an adverse outcome of any significant matter could have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated results of operations or cash flows in the quarter or annual period in which one or more of these matters are resolved 
the company believes that at this time there is no pending or threatened litigation that is likely to have a material adverse effect on the company

description of business standard microsystems corporation the company or smsc designs and sells a wide variety of silicon based integrated circuits that incorporate digital or analog signal processing technologies  or both referred to as mixed signal 
the company s integrated circuits and systems provide a wide variety of signal processing attributes that are incorporated by its globally diverse customers into a wide variety of end products in the mobile and desktop personal computer pc  consumer electronics and infotainment  and industrial and other markets 
these semiconductor products generally provide connectivity  networking  or input output control solutions for a variety of high speed communication  computer and related peripheral  consumer electronic device  industrial control system  or auto infotainment applications 
the market for these solutions is increasingly diverse  and the company s various technologies are increasingly used in various combinations and in alternative applications 
critical accounting policies estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and page 
table of contents disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of sales and revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
smsc believes the following critical accounting policies and estimates are important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows  and require critical management judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
although management believes that its judgments and estimates are appropriate and reasonable  actual future results may differ from these estimates  and to the extent that such differences are material  future reported operating results may be affected 
revenue recognition sales and revenues and associated gross profit from shipments to the company s distributors  other than to distributors in japan  are deferred until the distributors resell the products 
shipments to distributors  other than to distributors in japan  are made under agreements allowing price protection and limited rights to return unsold merchandise 
in addition  smsc s shipments to its distributors may be subject from time to time to short term fluctuations as distributors manage their inventories to current levels of end user demand 
therefore  smsc considers the policy of deferring revenue on shipments to distributors to be a more meaningful presentation of the company s operating results  as it allows investors to better understand end user demand for the products that smsc sells through distribution channels  and it better focuses the company on end user demand 
this policy is a common practice within the semiconductor industry 
the company s revenue recognition is therefore highly dependent upon receiving pertinent  accurate and timely data from its distributors 
distributors routinely provide the company with product  price  quantity and end customer data when products are resold  as well as report the quantities of the company s products that are still in their inventories 
in determining the appropriate amount of revenue to recognize  the company uses this data and applies judgment in reconciling any differences between the distributors reported inventories and shipment activities 
although this information is reviewed and verified for accuracy  any errors or omissions made by the company s distributors and not detected by the company  if material  could affect reported operating results 
shipments made by the company s japanese subsidiary to distributors in japan are made under agreements that permit limited or no stock return or price protection privileges 
smsc recognizes revenue from product sales to distributors in japan  and to original equipment manufacturers oems  at the time of shipment  net of appropriate reserves for product returns and allowances 
for these revenues  the company must make assumptions and estimates of future product returns and sales allowances  and any differences between those estimates and actual results  if material  could affect reported operating results 
inventories the company s inventories are comprised of complex  high technology products that may be subject to rapid technological obsolescence and which are sold in a highly competitive industry 
inventories are valued at the lower of first in  first out cost or market  and are reviewed for product obsolescence and impairment in value  based upon assumptions of future demand and market conditions 
the company often receives orders from customers and distributors requesting delivery of product on relatively short notice and with lead times that are shorter than the manufacturing cycle time 
in order to provide competitive delivery times to its customers  the company builds and stocks a certain amount of inventory in anticipation of customer demand that may or may not materialize 
historically  forecasts of customer demand  particularly at a part number level  are challenging and can vary significantly from actual future demand 
in addition  as is common in the semiconductor industry  customers may be allowed to cancel orders with minimal advance notice 
these dynamics create risks that the company may forecast incorrectly and consequently produce excess or insufficient inventories 
when it is determined that specific inventory is stated at a higher value than that which can be recovered  the company writes this inventory down to its estimated realizable value with a charge to costs of goods sold 
while the company endeavors to appropriately forecast customer demand and stock commensurate levels of inventory  unanticipated inventory write downs may be required in future periods relating to inventory on hand as of any reported balance sheet 
page 
table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
these estimated losses are based upon historical bad debts  specific customer creditworthiness and current economic trends 
the company regularly performs credit evaluations consisting primarily of reviews of its customers financial condition  using information provided by the customers as well as publicly available information  if any 
if the financial condition of an individual customer or group of customers deteriorates  resulting in such customers inability to make payments within approved credit terms  additional allowances may be required 
valuation of long lived assets long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment  and intangible assets  are monitored and reviewed for impairment in value whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any such asset may not be recoverable 
the determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the related asset and its eventual disposition 
the estimated cash flows are based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about expected future operating performance  growth rates and other factors 
estimates of undiscounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to factors such as technological changes  economic conditions  and changes in the company s business model or operating performance 
if at the time of such evaluation the sum of expected undiscounted cash flows excluding interest is below the carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized  which is measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset 
goodwill is tested for impairment in value annually  as well as when an event or circumstance occurs indicating a possible impairment in value 
the company completed its most recent annual goodwill impairment review during the fourth quarter of fiscal  during which no impairment in value was identified 
unless an indicator of impairment is identified earlier  the next goodwill impairment review will be performed in the fourth quarter of fiscal marketable and non marketable long term equity investments are also monitored for indications of impairment in value 
the company records an impairment charge against these investments when the investment is judged to have experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
judgments regarding the value of non marketable equity investments are subjective and dependent upon management s assessment of the performance of the investee and its prospects for future success 
during the third quarter of fiscal  impairment charges totaling million were recorded against two such investments  both of which were subsequently sold during fiscal as of february   the company had no significant long term equity investments 
income taxes accounting for income tax obligations requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities  using enacted tax rates  for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets resulting from these differences must be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the company regularly evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets by assessing its forecasts of future taxable income and reviewing available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets 
at february   the company had million of deferred tax assets considered fully realizable and million of deferred tax liabilities 
factors that may affect the company s ability to achieve sufficient future taxable income for purposes of realizing its deferred tax assets include declines in sales and revenues or gross profit  increased competition and loss of market share  delays in product availability  and technological obsolescence 
legal contingencies from time to time  the company is subject to legal proceedings and claims  including claims of alleged infringement of patents and other intellectual property rights and other claims arising in the ordinary course of business 
these contingencies require management to assess the likelihood and possible cost of adverse judgments page 
table of contents or outcomes 
liabilities for legal contingencies are accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
there can be no assurance that any third party assertions against the company will be resolved without costly litigation  in a manner that is not adverse to its financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in addition  the resolution of any future intellectual property litigation may subject the company to royalty obligations  product redesigns or discontinuance of products  any of which could adversely impact future profitability 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  accounting for share based payments sfas r 
the scope of sfas r includes a wide range of share based compensation arrangements including stock options  restricted stock plans  performance based awards  stock appreciation rights  and employee stock purchase plans 
sfas r replaces sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  sfas and supersedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
sfas  as originally issued in  established as preferable a fair value based method of accounting for share based payment transactions with employees 
however  that statement permitted the option of continuing to apply the guidance in apb  provided that the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements disclosed pro forma net income and net income per share  as if the preferable fair value based method had been applied 
sfas r requires that compensation costs relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
compensation costs will be measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
sfas r is effective for the first annual reporting period that begins after june  smsc s fiscal year ending february  
the company is currently evaluating the impact of sfas r  but believes that the adoption of this statement will likely have a material adverse impact on its consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in november  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp nos 
fas and fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  which provides guidance on determining when investments in certain debt and equity securities are considered impaired  whether that impairment is other than temporary  and the measurement of an impairment loss 
this fsp also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other than temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other than temporary impairments 
the fsp is required to be applied to reporting periods beginning after december  smsc s fiscal quarter ending may  
the company does not expect the adoption of this fsp in the first quarter of fiscal to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections sfas  which changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of voluntary changes in accounting principles 
sfas requires retrospective application to prior periods consolidated financial statements of changes in accounting principles  unless impracticable 
sfas supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting changes apb  which previously required that most voluntary changes in accounting principles be recognized by including in the current period s net income the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle 
sfas also makes a distinction between retrospective application of an accounting principle and the restatement of consolidated financial statements to reflect the correction of an error 
sfas carries forward without changing the guidance contained in apb for reporting the correction of an error in previously issued consolidated financial statements and a change in accounting estimate 
sfas applies to voluntary changes in accounting principles that are made in fiscal years beginning after december  smsc s fiscal year ending february  
the company does not expect the adoption of sfas in the first quarter of fiscal to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
business acquisition on march   smsc announced the acquisition of karlsruhe  germany based oasis siliconsystems holding ag oasis  a leading provider of media oriented systems transport most or most technology  serving a top tier customer base of leading automakers and automotive suppliers 
oasis infotainment page 
table of contents networking technology has been widely adopted by many european luxury and mid market car brands  including audi  bmw  daimlerchrysler  land rover  porsche  saab and volvo 
the initial cost of the acquisition at march  was approximately million  including approximately million of cash  million shares of smsc common stock  valued at million  and an estimated million of direct acquisition costs  including legal  banking  accounting and valuation fees 
included with the net assets acquired from oasis was approximately million of cash and cash equivalents  therefore smsc s initial net cash outlay for the transaction  including transaction costs  was approximately million 
the terms of the agreement also provided the former oasis shareholders the opportunity to earn up to million of additional consideration  based upon achieving certain fiscal performance goals  the amount earned of which  if any  was indeterminable until february  based upon fiscal performance  the company determined that the former oasis shareholders earned an additional million of consideration  consisting of approximately million shares of smsc common stock valued for accounting purposes as of february  at million  and million of cash  all of which was paid during the first quarter of fiscal smsc s existing cash balances were used to fund the cash portion of the additional consideration 
this additional consideration was recorded as additional goodwill and a corresponding liability was reflected within current liabilities on the company s consolidated balance sheet at february   resulting in an aggregate purchase price for oasis of million 
refer to part iv item a financial statements note  for additional information on the final computation and settlement of this obligation 
results of operations fiscal year ended february  compared to fiscal year ended february  sales and revenues smsc s sales and revenues are comprised of sales of products across three strategically targeted vertical end markets  as well as intellectual property revenues consisting of royalties and similar contractual payments  as presented in the following table for fiscal and dollars in millions fiscal fiscal amount percent amount percent mobile and desktop pc consumer electronics and infotainment industrial and other total product sales intellectual property revenues total sales and revenues the company s sales and revenues for fiscal were million  consisting of million of product sales and million of intellectual property revenues  compared to fiscal sales and revenues of million  consisting of million of product sales and million of intellectual property revenues 
product sales in fiscal include million of sales from shipments of oasis products subsequent to the march  acquisition date 
sales of mobile and desktop pc products increased by approximately million or in fiscal  driven primarily by an increase in sales of mobile pc products reflecting strong market demand in mobile computing applications  as well as increased sales of environmental monitoring and control emc products  as the company broadened its emc product offerings in fiscal sales of mobile pc products in fiscal also included million of sales associated with a prior accounts receivable collectibility issue  as more fully described below 
smsc s sales of desktop pc products were up modestly in fiscal  despite softer market demand for desktop pcs 
sales from mobile pc product shipments were adversely impacted in fiscal by an accounts receivable collectibility issue with one of the company s taiwan based component distributors 
in the third quarter of fiscal page 
table of contents  the company determined that this long time customer  whose credit and payment history with the company had consistently been satisfactory  was experiencing financial distress and a lack of liquidity 
as collectibility was not reasonably assured  the company deferred recognition of approximately million of product sales and corresponding trade receivables for shipments made to this distributor during the second half of fiscal the related inventory for these product sales  at a cost of approximately million  had already been shipped to and resold by the distributor prior to identification of the collectibility issue and was fully charged to costs of goods sold in fiscal as the financial condition of this customer is still uncertain  the company has ceased conducting business with this distributor 
future recovery of the remaining unpaid obligation to smsc is as yet uncertain 
the company successfully arranged alternate channels for delivery of these products to its end customers  and no disruption occurred in the supply of the company s products 
sales of consumer electronics and infotainment products increased by approximately million or  primarily as a result of the march acquisition of oasis approximately million of the noted increase  as well as stronger sales of connectivity and networking products for consumer electronics applications 
expanded product offerings of connectivity and networking products in fiscal accounted for most of the organic sales growth in this end market this fiscal year 
industrial and other sales primarily represent sales from products used within industrial information networking and server applications in various business  service  factory  transportation and telecommunications environments 
sales of industrial and other products declined million  or  to million  as a decrease in market demand for smsc s embedded computing designs was experienced and only partially offset by increased demand for embedded networking technology 
the company expects that overall industrial market adoption rates of embedded technology and market penetration due to enhanced product offerings will increase in the future 
intellectual property revenues include million and million in fiscal and  respectively  received from intel corporation pursuant to the terms of a september business agreement 
intellectual property revenues for fiscal include payments under this agreement of million in the first  second and third quarters and million in the fourth quarter 
fiscal results include the payments of million in each of the fiscal year s quarterly periods 
sales and revenues by geographic region for fiscal years and were as follows fiscal in millions taiwan japan united states germany other intellectual property revenues received from intel are included within the united states 
the increase in germany is primarily due to the oasis acquisition 
product sales to electronic component distributors were reflected in the table above based on the geographic location of their respective operations  the geographic locations of the end customers may differ 
the company expects international shipments  particularly to asia  to continue to represent a significant portion of its sales and revenues for the foreseeable future 
a significant portion of the world s high technology manufacturing and assembly activity occurs in asia  where many of the company s significant customers conduct business 
costs of goods sold costs of goods sold include the purchase cost of finished silicon wafers manufactured by independent foundries including mask and tooling costs  costs of assembly  packaging  and mechanical and electrical testing  manufacturing overhead  quality assurance and other support overhead including costs of personnel and equipment page 
table of contents associated with manufacturing support  royalties paid to developers of intellectual property incorporated into the company s products  and adjustments for excess  slow moving or obsolete inventories 
costs of goods sold for fiscal were million  or of sales and revenues  compared to million  or of sales and revenues  in fiscal excluding intellectual property revenues  costs of goods sold were of product sales in fiscal  as compared to in fiscal the decrease in costs of goods sold as a percentage of revenues in fiscal  compared to fiscal  resulted from a combination of i the lower costs of goods sold as a percentage of sales associated with oasis products and ii million of revenue recognized during the current year period without any associated costs of goods sold  in connection with the previously discussed prior accounts receivable collectibility issue see sales and revenues discussion above 
partially offsetting these favorable factors were i declines in average selling prices on certain desktop i o product margins  as declines in average selling prices outpaced reductions in unit costs  and ii million of higher provisions for compensation expense related to stock appreciation rights sars 
research and development expenses research and development r d expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs of employees engaged in research  design and development activities  costs related to engineering design tools and computer hardware  subcontractor costs and device prototyping costs 
the company s r d activities are performed by highly skilled and experienced engineers and technicians  and are primarily directed towards the design of new integrated circuits  the development of new software drivers  firmware and design tools and blocks of logic  and investment in new product offerings based on converging technology trends  as well as ongoing cost reductions and performance improvements in existing products 
the company intends to continue its efforts to develop innovative new products and technologies  and believes that an ongoing commitment to r d is essential in order to maintain product leadership and compete effectively 
therefore  the company expects to continue to make significant r d investments in the future 
r d expenses for fiscal were million  or approximately of sales and revenues  compared to million  or approximately of sales and revenues  for fiscal the spending increase was primarily due to the addition of approximately million of r d expenses associated with the operations of oasis  the acquisition of which added approximately engineers and technicians to the company s engineering team  million for compensation expense from sars  and million of higher compensation and benefit costs driven by engineering staff additions 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or approximately of sales and revenues  for fiscal  compared to million  or approximately of sales and revenues  for fiscal the increase in fiscal spending  compared to fiscal  includes million of expenses associated with the operations of oasis  million of higher compensation expense from sars  million of higher general compensation and benefit cost exclusive of impact of oasis  and million of higher employee recruitment and relocation cost which were partially offset by million of lower legal  accounting and other professional fees  due in part to lower cost associated with litigation 
fiscal expenses also include approximately million of office lease expenses relating to prior periods 
amortization of intangible assets amortization expense was million and million in fiscal and  respectively  and represents the amortization of finite lived intangible assets associated with the company s march acquisition of oasis and june acquisition of gain 
in process research and development the million in process research and development expense recorded in fiscal represents the fair value of in process technology for oasis research projects that  as of the march  closing date of the oasis page 
table of contents acquisition  had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses 
these projects primarily focused on deployment of certain technology into consumer electronics applications 
the estimated fair value of this in process research and development was recorded as an expense as of the oasis acquisition date  in the fiscal quarter ended may  gains on real estate transactions during the third quarter of fiscal  the company sold its remaining parcel of idle real estate in hauppauge  new york  for net proceeds of million  after transaction costs 
this property had a carrying value of approximately million 
the contract of sale required the company to complete the remediation of certain soil contamination of uncertain origin identified at this property  at its expense 
in recognition of both the uncertain cost and uncertain completion date of the soil remediation obligation at that time  the company did not reflect the impact of this transaction within its statement of operations for the third quarter of fiscal the company subsequently completed the project during the fourth quarter of fiscal  and received final regulatory approval thereafter 
accordingly  the company then recognized a gain of million on this transaction  net of related remediation project costs  in the fourth quarter of fiscal settlement charge in june  smsc was named as a defendant in a patent infringement lawsuit filed by analog devices  inc adi  which alleged that some of the company s products infringed one or more of three of adi s patents  and sought injunctive relief and unspecified damages 
in september  the company filed an answer in the lawsuit  denying adi s allegations and raising affirmative defenses and counterclaims 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company and adi reached a settlement of this dispute  under which both parties agreed to dismiss all claims against each other 
as part of the agreement  the company made a one time payment of million to adi  which is reported as a settlement charge on the company s consolidated statement of operations for fiscal as part of the settlement  adi also granted the company a royalty bearing license to the patents in question
