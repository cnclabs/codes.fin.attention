item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations proposal by mutual on march   the chairman of the board of the company received a letter from the chairman of mutual that indicated that mutual was interested in acquiring the company and was prepared to negotiate an all cash acquisition by way of a tender offer and or merger for all the outstanding common stock of the company at per share 
the letter noted that the per share price of the proposed offer is less than both the gaap and stat book values per share of the company s stock as well as recent closing prices of the company s common stock on the american stock exchange  but it stated that the proposed offer would be within the range of values that mutual believed the company s shareholders would find acceptable for an all cash offer for all shares under the circumstances 
the letter indicated that the only conditions that mutual could foresee to a closing would be any approvals required from the state insurance departments which mutual stated that it was highly confident could be obtained in a relatively short time and assurances from am best company and fitch ratings that the respective ratings of mutual and the company would not be reduced as a result of the acquisition 
the letter indicated that mutual s offer to negotiate the proposed offer would remain outstanding until the close of business on april   provided  however  that mutual would consider extending the period of the offer to negotiate through april  if the company advises mutual by april  that its board of directors requires additional time to evaluate the proposal

assignments from the nyaip vary depending upon a company s ppa market share and the size of the nyaip 
the company is unable to predict the volume of future assignments from the nyaip 
in order to minimize the adverse impact of assignments from the nyaip  the company purchased territorial credits from an unaffiliated company pursuant to section a of the nyaip manual 
the credits against nyaip assignments were generated by the other insurance company for writing ppa business in certain localities in new york with ppa market availability problems 
the other insurance company  by nature of its concentration in ppa business in credit territories  generated more credits than it required to offset its nyaip assignments

critical accounting policies reserve for losses and lae the reserve for losses and lae is an estimate of the ultimate cost of settling all losses incurred and unpaid  including those losses not yet reported to the company  and is stated net of reinsurance 
the amount of loss reserves for reported claims is based upon a case by case evaluation of the circumstances and policy provisions pertaining to the claim case reserves relating to the loss 
reserves for claims that have occurred but have not been reported ibnr to the company and for the costs of settling or adjusting claims are determined using commonly accepted actuarial techniques based on historical information for each of the company s products  adjusted for current conditions 
the company s primary assumption when determining its reserves is that past experience  adjusted for the effect of current developments and trends  is relevant in predicting future events 
when establishing its loss reserves  the company analyzes historical data and estimates the impact of various loss development factors such as the historical loss experience of the company and of the industry  the mix of products sold  trends in claim frequency and severity  the company s claim processing procedures  changes in legislation  judicial decisions  legal developments  including the prevalence of litigation in the areas served by the company  and changes in general economic conditions including inflation 
management determines the amount of reserves for losses and lae to be recorded based upon analyses prepared by the company s internal and external actuaries and management s assessment of a reasonable amount of reserves 
the reasonable estimate is determined after considering the estimates produced using a variety of actuarial techniques for each of the company s products 
the following is a summary of the methods used 
table of contents paid loss development the paid loss development method is based on the assumption that past rates of claims payments are indicative of future rates of claims payments 
an advantage of this method is that paid losses contain no case reserve estimates 
additionally  paid losses are not as greatly influenced by changes in claims reserving practices as are incurred losses 
estimates can be distorted if changes in claims handling practices or procedures cause an acceleration or deceleration in claims payments 
furthermore  paid loss development may produce biased estimates for long tailed products where paid loss development factors are large at early evaluation points 
incurred loss development the incurred loss development method is based on the assumption that the past relative adequacy of case reserves is consistent with the current relative adequacy of case reserves 
because incurred losses include payments and case reserves  a larger volume of data is considered in the estimate of ultimate losses 
as a result  incurred loss data patterns may be less erratic than paid loss data patterns  particularly for coverages on which claims are reported relatively quickly but have a long payout pattern 
because this method assumes that the relative adequacy of case reserves has been consistent  changes in claims handling procedures or the occurrence or absence of large losses may cause estimates to be erratic 
bornhuetter ferguson with premium and paid loss the bornhuetter ferguson bf with premium and paid loss method is a combination of the paid loss development method and an expected loss ratio assumption 
the expected loss ratios are modified to the extent actual loss payments differ from payments expected based on the selected paid loss development pattern 
this method avoids possible distortions resulting from a large development factor being applied to a small base of paid losses in order to estimate ultimate losses 
this method will react slowly if actual ultimate losses differ substantially from losses inherent in the expected loss ratio 
bornhuetter ferguson with premium and incurred loss the bornhuetter ferguson bf with premium and incurred loss method is a combination of the incurred loss development method and an expected loss ratio assumption 
the expected loss ratios are modified to the extent actual incurred losses differ from expected incurred losses based on the selected incurred loss development pattern 
this method avoids possible distortions resulting from a large development factor being applied to a small base of incurred losses in order to estimate ultimate losses 
this method will react slowly if actual ultimate losses differ substantially from losses inherent in the expected loss ratio 
ultimate claims and average loss this method multiplies the estimated number of ultimate claims by a selected ultimate average loss for each accident year to produce ultimate loss estimates 
if loss development methods produce erratic or unreliable estimates  this method can provide more stable estimates  consistent with recent loss history 
this method may produce erratic results if there has been a change in the way claims 
table of contents are counted or in the mix of types of loss 
the occurrence or absence of large losses can also distort the average loss estimate 
allocated loss adjustment expenses alae are estimated separately from losses because alae payment patterns differ from loss payment patterns 
the company employs the following methods to estimate alae reserves 
paid alae development this method is analogous to the paid loss development method except paid alae is developed instead of paid losses 
paid alae patterns often are more stable than paid loss patterns 
however  paid alae typically develop more slowly than paid losses  resulting in a large leveraging impact on less mature accident years 
bornhuetter ferguson with ultimate loss and paid alae the bornhuetter ferguson bf with ultimate loss and paid alae method is a combination of the paid alae development method and an expected ratio of ultimate alae to ultimate loss 
the expected alae to loss ratios are modified to the extent paid alae differ from expected based on the selected paid alae development pattern 
this method avoids possible distortions resulting from a large development factor being applied to a small base of paid alae in order to estimate ultimate alae 
this is a useful method for estimating ultimate alae for less mature accident years 
estimated ultimate losses and lae and the resulting reserve for losses and lae are determined based on the results of the methods described above along with the following considerations how results of methods based on paid losses compare to methods based on incurred losses 
how results of paid and incurred development methods compare to results of paid and incurred bf methods 
whether diagnostic tests cause management to favor the results of one or more methods over the results of other methods 
such tests include closed claim to reported claim ratios average case reserves per open claim paid loss per closed claim paid loss to incurred loss ratios the reasonableness of ultimate loss alae ratios and ultimate severities management s consideration of other factors such as premium and loss trends  large loss experience  legislative and judicial changes and changes in underwriting guidelines and practices 
to the extent these considerations result in changes to the company s estimates of reserves for losses and lae related to prior accident years  the company recognizes such changes in the accounting period in which the change becomes known 
as stated previously  the above methods assume that past experience adjusted for the effects of current developments and trends is an appropriate basis for predicting future events 
a range of reasonably likely reserves by product as of december   net of reinsurance  developed by the company s actuaries are shown in the table below 
generally the low and the high values in the range represent 
table of contents reasonable minimum and maximum amounts of these actuarial indications using the methods described above 
range of net loss lae reserves s products low recorded high personal auto homeowners commercial auto workers compensation commercial general liability commercial property other all products the products shown in this table are those used by the company in its loss reserving process 
the company s reserve for unpaid losses and lae as appears in the table that follows  are segregated by product type as defined in the company s annual statement filed with insurance department regulators 
because the reserve estimates by product are independent of each other it is highly unlikely that the actual results for each of the products will be consistent with all of the high estimates  or with all of the low estimates  at the same time 
accordingly  the low and the high estimates for all products shown above are greater than the sum of the low estimates and less than the sum of the high estimates resulting in a narrower range 
despite the many factors considered in the reserving process  it is reasonably probable that actual payments for losses and lae will differ from those contemplated in the company s reserves 
such fluctuations could have a significant impact on the company s net income 
this is primarily due to the size of the company s reserves for losses and lae  at december  relative to its net income 
the following table presents the liability for the reserve for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses separated into case reserves  reserves for ibnr losses and reserves for lae by major product 
table of contents december  s case reserves ppa liability homeowners commercial auto liability workers compensation commercial package general liability other total case reserves ibnr ppa liability homeowners commercial auto liability workers compensation commercial package general liability other total ibnr reserve for lae ppa liability homeowners commercial auto liability workers compensation commercial package general liability other total reserve for lae subtotal reinsurance recoverables reserve for losses and lae deferred policy acquisition costs policy acquisition costs  such as commissions net of reinsurance commissions  premiums taxes and certain other underwriting expenses which vary directly with premium volume  are deferred and amortized over the terms of the related insurance policies 
deferred policy acquisition costs are evaluated on an aggregate basis at least quarterly to determine if recorded amounts exceed estimated recoverable amounts after allowing for anticipated investment income 
premium deficiencies  if any  are recorded as amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs 
actual amounts may vary from the company s estimates 
investments fixed maturity investments are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value 
net unrealized holding gains or losses  net of taxes  are shown as accumulated other comprehensive income 
investment income is recognized when earned  and gains and losses are recognized when investments are sold and in instances when a decline in the fair value of a security is determined to be other than temporary 
the company s investment committee  comprised of the chief operating officer  the chief investment officer and the chief financial officer  meets monthly and monitors the company s investment 
table of contents portfolio for declines in value that are other than temporary 
this assessment requires significant judgment 
the investment committee considers the nature of the investment  the severity and length of the decline in fair value  events specific to the issuer including valuation modeling  overall market conditions  and the company s intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
when a decline in the fair value of a security is determined to be other than temporary  the company adjusts the cost basis of that security to fair value and records a charge to earnings 
future increases in fair value and future decreases in fair value if not other than temporary are included in other comprehensive income 
liquidity and capital resources in developing its investment strategy the company determines a level of cash and short term investments which  when combined with expected cash flow  is estimated to be adequate to meet expected cash obligations 
due to declining written premiums however  the company s operating activities have resulted in a use of cash each year since the company s decreasing participation percentage in the pooled business over the remaining years of the reinsurance pooling agreement will likely result in continued negative cash flows from operations 
net cash used in operations was  in the company believes that careful management of the relationship between assets and liabilities will minimize the likelihood that investment portfolio sales will be necessary to fund insurance operations  and that the effect of such sales  if any  on the company s stockholders equity will not be material 
the company s objectives with respect to its investment portfolio include maximizing total return within investment guidelines while protecting policyholders surplus and maintaining flexibility 
the company relies on premiums as a major source of cash  and therefore liquidity 
cash flows from the company s investment portfolio  in the form of interest or principal payments  are an additional source of liquidity 
at december   the company owned investment securities  of which were in an unrealized loss position 
as of december  all of the company s fixed maturity investments were exchange traded or are readily marketable and are supported by the broker dealer community 
the total potential impact on the company s future earnings if the unrealized losses associated with its investment portfolio at december  were to become other than temporary would be  or  after taxes 
included in net investment losses for the year ended december  are write downs on two investment securities held in the company s investment portfolio at december  determined to have had an other than temporary impairment in market value 
the total amount of other than temporary impairments recorded as losses amounted to  in no other than temporary impairments were recorded in or at december    or of the company s investment portfolio was invested in non investment grade securities  compared to  or at december  the company designates newly acquired fixed maturity investments as available for sale and carries these investments at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses related to these investments are recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders equity 
at december   the company recorded as accumulated other comprehensive loss in its consolidated balance sheet  of net unrealized losses  net of taxes  associated with investments classified as available for sale 

table of contents at december  the company s portfolio of fixed maturity investments represented of invested assets 
management believes that this level of fixed maturity investments is consistent with the company s liquidity needs because it anticipates that cash receipts from net premiums written  investment income and maturing securities will enable the company to satisfy its cash obligations 
furthermore  a portion of the company s fixed maturity investments are invested in mortgage backed and other asset backed securities which  in addition to interest income  provide monthly paydowns of bond principal 
at december    or  of the company s fixed maturity portfolio was invested in mortgage backed and other asset backed securities 
the company invests in a variety of collateralized mortgage obligation cmo products but has not invested in the derivative type of cmo products such as interest only  principal only or inverse floating rate securities 
all of the company s cmo investments have a secondary market and their effect on the company s liquidity does not differ significantly from that of other fixed maturity investments
