critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of its financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
management believes that its critical accounting policies are limited to those described below 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note summary of significant accounting policies to the audited consolidated financial statements included in this report 
allowance for loan losses 
the company s allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable incurred losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date 
additions to the allowance may result from recording provision for loan losses and recoveries  while charge offs are deducted from the allowance 
allocation of the allowance is made for analytical purposes only  and the entire allowance is available to absorb any loan charged off 
the company has an established process for determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses that relies on various procedures and pieces of information to arrive at a range of probable outcomes 
no single statistic or measurement  in itself  determines the adequacy of the allowance 
the allowance has two components identified specific allocations and a percentage allocation based on loss history for different loan groups 
to determine the allocated component of the allowance  the company combines estimated allowances required for specifically identified loans that are analyzed individually and loans that are analyzed on a group basis 
first  management allocates specific portions of the allowance for loan losses based on identifiable problem loans 
problem loans are identified through a loan risk rating system and monitored through watchlist reporting 
specific allocations of allowance for loan losses are determined for each identified credit based on delinquency rates  collateral and other risk factors identified for that credit 
second  management s evaluation of the allowance for different loan groups is based on consideration of actual loss experience  the present and prospective financial condition of borrowers  industry concentrations within the loan portfolio and general economic conditions  and absent the availability of some of those factors  based upon peer industry data of comparable banks 
lastly  the unallocated component of the allowance is maintained to supplement the allocated component and to recognize the imprecision of estimating and measuring loss when evaluating loss allocations for individual loans or pools of loans 
the allocated and the unallocated components represent the total allowance for loan losses that would adequately cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the determination of the level of allowance and  correspondingly  the provision for loan losses  rests upon estimates and assumptions  including past loan loss experience  the nature and volume of the portfolio  information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values  economic conditions and other factors 
loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan is confirmed 
a loan is impaired when full payment under the loan terms is not expected 
impairment is evaluated in the aggregate for smaller balance loans of a similar nature such as residential mortgage and consumer loans  and on an individual loan basis for other loans 
commercial loans and mortgage loans secured by other properties are evaluated individually for impairment 
when analysis of a borrower s operating results and financial condition indicates that underlying cash flows of the borrower s business are not adequate to meet its debt service requirements  the loan is evaluated for impairment 
if a loan is impaired  a portion of the allowance is allocated so that the loan is reported  net  at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan s existing interest rate or at the fair value of collateral if repayment is expected solely from the collateral 
there are many factors affecting the allowance for loan losses  some are quantitative while others require qualitative judgment 
although management believes its process for determining the allowance adequately considers all of the potential factors that could potentially result in credit losses  the process includes subjective elements and may be susceptible to significant change 
to the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates  additional provision for loan losses could be required that could adversely affect earnings or financial position in future periods 
financial condition the company experienced significant growth during total assets of the company were  at december  compared to  at december   an increase of  or 
the significant increase in assets was mainly attributable to growth in the loan portfolio and was funded by a significant growth in deposits and fhlb advances 
asset growth has been substantial during each year since the bank began operations 
management anticipates that  in the near term  assets will increase at a rate similar to the bank s historical trends as management continues to market its institution  products and banking expertise  deliver a high level of customer service and develop its branch network 
earning assets 
the company s loan portfolio experienced another year of significant growth during loans were  at december  compared to  at december   an increase of  or 
the loan portfolio  which equaled and of earning assets at december  and  respectively  was primarily comprised of commercial and commercial real estate loans at both dates 
at december   commercial and commercial real estate loans were approximately of the loan portfolio and represented loans to business interests generally located within the bank s market area 
approximately of the loan portfolio at december  consisted of general commercial and industrial loans primarily secured by inventory  receivables and equipment  while of the loan portfolio consisted of commercial loans primarily secured by real estate 
the largest concentrations of credit within the commercial category are represented by owner occupied and investment real estate at  or of total loans  and building  development and general contracting at million  or of total loans 
the concentration and growth in commercial credits is in keeping with the bank s strategy of focusing a substantial amount of efforts on commercial banking 
business banking is an area of expertise for the bank s management and lending team 
residential mortgage and home equity lending  while only of loans at december   also experienced significant growth 
consumer loans  while only of total loans at december   reflected an increase of during from levels 
management believes that loan growth should continue as the bank expands its distribution network during  however  the company s main strategy for growth and profitability is expected to come largely from the commercial loan sector

these guidelines include loan review and early identification of problem loans to provide effective loan portfolio administration 
the credit policies and procedures are meant to minimize the risk and uncertainties inherent in lending 
in following these policies and procedures  the bank must rely on estimates  appraisals and evaluation of loans and the possibility that changes could occur because of changing economic conditions 
identified problem loans  which exhibit characteristics financial or otherwise that could cause the loans to become nonperforming or require restructuring in the future  are included on an internal watchlist 
senior management reviews this list regularly and adjusts for changing conditions 
at december   there were  of potential problem loans outstanding classified on the watchlist

in each quarter  the allowance for loan losses is adjusted by management to the amount management believes is necessary to maintain the allowance at adequate levels 
management allocates specific portions of the allowance for loan losses to specifically identified problem loans 
management s evaluation of the allowance is further based on consideration of actual loss experience  the present and prospective financial condition of borrowers  industry concentrations within the portfolio and general economic conditions 
management believes that the present allowance is adequate  based on the broad range of considerations listed above  and further  based upon peer industry data of comparable banks

management has a reporting system that monitors past due loans and has adopted policies to pursue its creditor s rights in order to preserve the bank s position 
the primary risk elements with respect to commercial loans are the financial condition of the borrower  the sufficiency of collateral  and lack of timely payment 
management has a policy of requesting and reviewing periodic financial statements from its commercial loan customers  and periodically reviews the sufficiency of collateral and its value 
although management considers the allowance for loan losses to be adequate to absorb losses that are incurred  there can be no assurance that charge offs in future periods will not exceed the allowance 
additionally  banking regulators can require an increase to the allowance for loan losses if they deem necessary to satisfy regulatory safety and soundness concerns

interest income and interest expense for the year ended december  totaled  and  respectively  providing for net interest income of  the substantial increase of  in net interest income in from and the increase over net interest income from were primarily attributable to an increase in the loans outstanding in both years  as well as an increase in the prime lending rate during and the net yield on average earning assets during was compared to for and for the increase in margin during was attributable to net interest spread expansion caused by the increase in general interest rates and its effects on the company s mostly variable rate mix of loans 
management anticipates that margins will continue to slightly improve due to the company s current asset sensitive balance sheet  assuming interest rates increase 
the company is also planning to increase its percentage of fixed rate loans and shorten the term of any out of market deposits and borrowings during to help offset any potential negative effects of interest rate decreases 
the level of net interest income is primarily a function of asset size  as the weighted average interest rate received on earning assets is greater than the weighted average interest cost of funding sources  however  factors such as types of assets and liabilities  interest rate risk  liquidity  and customer behavior also impact net interest income as well as the net yield

driven by net charge offs loan growth  and the portfolio composition and risk  the provision for loan losses was  for   for and  for this reflects a  or  increase from to the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans outstanding was  and at december    and  respectively 
the decrease in our allowance for loan loss as a percentage of total loans between and was a result of the timing of which the company recorded charge offs 
historically  the company has set a specific allowance for the estimated unrealizable value of the loan and recorded the charge off upon final resolution of the problem loan 
in  in an effort to apply current accounting and regulatory standards in a manner that is more consistent with our industry and peers  the company began recording charge off s at the time the expected net realizable value was less than the gross carrying value  rather than carrying these notes at gross with a specific reserve allocated against it 
the company maintains the allowance for loan losses at a level management feels is adequate to absorb probable losses incurred in the loan portfolio 
the evaluation is based upon the company s and the banking industry s historical loan loss experience  known and inherent risks contained in the loan portfolio  composition and growth of the loan portfolio  current and projected economic conditions and other factors 
given the lack of seasoning of the bank s portfolio in addition to considering the company s loss history  management has established the provision and allowance for loan losses in part based on the loss experience of peer financial institutions with similar heavy concentrations in commercial lending and in part based on general trends in the economy 
the company had  of nonperforming loans at december   a decrease of from the  of nonperforming loans at december  the company reported  of net charge offs  or 
of average loans during compared to  in net charge offs or 
of average loans during noninterest income 
total noninterest income was  for the year ended december  compared to  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease of in total noninterest income between and is reflective of a one time insurance settlement received during the fourth quarter of fees from trust and brokerage services grew resulting from an increasing base of accounts and assets under management and was  for compared to  for and  in mortgage broker fees were during  a decrease of or from for mortgage broker fees were for the decrease in was attributable to a conscious effort by the company to retain more loans in its own portfolio versus brokering for a third party 
total mortgage loan origination volume of approximately was virtually unchanged between and deposit service charges were in  showing an increase of or from deposit service charges decreased or between and service charge income increased in due to an overall expanded account base  a higher level of fees generated on business accounts and increased activity from nsf od charges 
in november  the bank received a reimbursement from its insurance carrier against losses recorded for the unauthorized mortgage issue detected in the reimbursement received was for  however the bank incurred expenses and losses against this claim of and  in and respectively 
other fee income increased mainly as a result of income generated from bank owned life insurance boli 
in addition to the above  noninterest income results included in losses on the sale of securities available for sale compared to gains on the sale of securities and loans totaling during and in noninterest expense 
noninterest expense totaled  for the year ended december  compared to  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  an increase of  or during over the increase in expenses is mainly attributable to the infrastructure growth of the company  including the addition new full time equivalent employees during this is evidenced by salary and benefit costs  which increased  or  and occupancy and equipment costs which increased  or  over their respective levels 
salary and benefits costs were  or of total noninterest expenses for  while occupancy and equipment costs were  or of total expenses 
loan and professional costs decreased during from prior year levels by or 
the decrease was attributable mainly to litigation costs related to the unauthorized mortgage issue insurance settlement that were incurred during other  various expense categories increased during  such as marketing  data processing  office supplies and postage  and courier services  but to a lesser dollar amount than those mentioned above 
other expense was for  for and a  for  which reflected a  or increase in and  or decrease in  as compared to the prior year 
other expense for included losses recorded for the unauthorized mortgage activity in the amount of during  salaries and benefits costs were  while occupancy and equipment expenses totaled  additional large overhead expenses in  included costs for loan and professional fees and services  which amounted to  and marketing expenses of significant noninterest expenses during were  for salary and benefit costs   for occupancy and equipment costs  and for loan and professional costs 
monitoring and controlling overhead expenses while providing high quality service to customers is of the utmost importance to the company 
the efficiency ratio  computed by dividing noninterest expense by net interest income plus noninterest income  was in compared to in and in the overall level of efficiency ratio continues to be high  but reflects expected infrastructure costs associated with growth as well as certain non recurring costs discussed above 
as anticipated  improvement in the efficiency ratio is dependent upon the growth in earning assets along with the development of fee based products and the resulting increases in revenue 
management expects that as additional asset growth and operating efficiencies are realized  the company will earn more on the larger base of earning assets while operating costs will increase at a lesser rate  resulting in an improved efficiency ratio

this type of funding is viewed by the company as only a secondary and temporary source of funds 
contractual obligations  commitments and off balance sheet risk in addition to normal loan funding and deposit flow  the company also needs to maintain liquidity to meet the demands of certain unfunded loan commitments and standby and commercial letters of credit 
the bank maintains off balance sheet financial instruments in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
loan commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer at any time  as the customer s needs vary  as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
we monitor fluctuations in loan balances and commitment levels and include such data in our overall liquidity management 
these instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized  if any  in the balance sheet 
the bank s maximum exposure to loan loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instruments for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the face amount of these instruments 
commitments to extend credit are recorded when they are funded and standby letters of credit are recorded at fair value 
the bank uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on balance sheet instruments 
collateral  such as accounts receivable  securities  inventory  property and equipment is generally required based on management s credit assessment of the borrower 
the company and the bank occupy their respective headquarters  offices and other facilities under long term operating leases and  in addition  are parties to long term contracts for data processing and operating systems

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk analysis the company s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk and  to a lesser extent  liquidity risk 
all of the company s transactions are denominated in us dollars with no specific foreign exchange exposure 
the company has no agricultural related loan assets and therefore has no significant exposure to changes in commodity prices 
any impact that changes in foreign exchange rates and commodity prices would have on interest rates is assumed to be insignificant 
interest rate risk is the exposure of the company s financial condition to adverse movements in interest rates 
the company derives its income primarily from the excess of interest collected on its interest earning assets over the interest paid on its interest bearing liabilities 
the rates of interest the company earns on its assets and owes on its liabilities generally are established contractually for a period of time 
since market interest rates change over time  the company is exposed to lower profitability if it cannot adapt to interest rate changes 
accepting interest rate risk can be an important source of profitability and stockholder value  however  excessive levels of interest rate risk could pose a significant threat to the company s earnings and capital base 
accordingly  effective risk management that maintains interest rate risk at prudent levels is essential to the company s safety and soundness 
evaluating the exposure to changes in interest rates includes assessing both the adequacy of the process used to control interest rate risk and the quantitative level of exposure 
the company s interest rate risk management process seeks to ensure that appropriate policies  procedures  management information and internal controls are in place to maintain interest rate risk at prudent levels with consistency and continuity 
in evaluating the quantitative level of interest rate risk  the company assesses the existing and potential future effects of changes in interest rates on its financial condition  including capital adequacy  earnings  liquidity and overall asset quality 
there are two interest rate risk measurement techniques which may be used by the company 
the first  which is commonly referred to as gap analysis  measures the difference between the dollar amount of interest sensitive assets and liabilities that will be refinanced or repriced during a given time period 
a significant repricing gap could result in a negative impact to the company s net interest margin during periods of changing market interest rates 
the following table depicts the company s gap position as of december  rate sensitivity analysis in thousands within three months three to twelve months one to five years after five years total assets federal funds sold  short term investments and interest earning deposits securities available for sale fhlbi and frb stock fixed rate loans variable rate loans allowance for loan losses other assets total assets liabilities interest bearing checking savings accounts money market accounts time deposits  time deposits  and over short term borrowings fhlb advances junior subordinated debt noninterest bearing checking other liabilities total liabilities stockholders equity total sources of funds net asset liability gap cumulative gap percent of cumulative gap to total assets a second interest rate risk measurement used is commonly referred to as net interest income simulation analysis 
a simulation model assesses the direction and magnitude of variations in net interest income resulting from potential changes in market interest rates 
key assumptions in the model include prepayment speeds on various loan and investment assets  cash flows and maturities of interest sensitive assets and liabilities  and changes in market conditions impacting loan and deposit volume and pricing 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain  subject to fluctuation and revision in a dynamic environment  therefore  a model cannot precisely estimate net interest income or exactly predict the impact of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income 
actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing  magnitude  and frequency of interest rate changes and changes in market conditions and the company s strategies  among other factors 
as growth has dictated  the company began utilizing simulation analysis as a tool for measuring the effects of interest rate risk on the income statement at the end of in addition to changes in interest rates  the level of future net interest income is also dependent on a number of other variables  including the growth  composition and absolute levels of loans  deposits  and other earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  economic and competitive conditions  potential changes in lending  investing  and deposit gathering strategies  client preferences  and other factors 
the following table provides information about the company s financial instruments used for purposes other than trading that are rate sensitive to changes in interest rates as of december  it does not provide when these items may actually reprice 
for loans receivable  securities  and liabilities with contractual maturities  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by contractual maturities as well as the company s historical experience of the impact of interest rate fluctuations on the prepayment of loans and mortgage backed securities 
for core deposits demand deposits  interest bearing checking  savings  and money market deposits that have no contractual maturity  the table presents principal cash flows and  as applicable related weighted average interest rates based upon the company s historical experience  and management s judgment as applicable  concerning their most likely withdrawal behaviors 
the current historical interest rates for core deposits have been assumed to apply for future periods in this table as the actual interest rates that will need to be paid to maintain these deposits are not currently known 
weighted average variable rates are based upon contractual rates existing at the report date
