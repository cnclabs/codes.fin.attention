item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a the following discussion of our results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with our selected consolidated financial data and the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this document 
overview since divesting ourselves of our unprofitable multi level marketing and direct marketing units in see discontinued operations  our business plan has been to focus on our core brands 
the natrol and laci le beau brands are sold in health food stores  in mass market drug  food and retail chains as well as club stores 
prolab products are sold through distributors who in turn service retail accounts 
prolab s distributor network focuses on health food stores  health clubs and fitness facilities that cater to body builders and other individuals seeking a high level of fitness 
with the integration of prolab as a brand within natrol  natrol s health food oriented sales professionals have become responsible for presenting appropriate prolab products to health food retailers  who in turn  order from distributors who carry prolab product 
in  more than of prolab sales were to distributors who sell prolab products outside the united states 
we are continually trying to expand the distribution of our best selling items to additional retail outlets and to create promotional opportunities for our products within our existing customer base 
we also provide contract manufacturing services to other supplement companies and sell a limited number of raw material ingredients to other nutraceutical companies 
key issues for management include product development  product introductions  inventory management  and controlling the cost of doing business in our various channels of trade 
the nutritional supplement business is dependent upon new product introductions for growth and to replace volume lost by products reaching the end of their product life cycles 
for these reasons  we continually research potential new products 
developing a single new product can be a multi year effort depending upon the complexity of the product and the amount of testing that must be completed to validate the product concept 
product introductions do not come without risk 
product launches can require substantial marketing support 
oftentimes retailers demand slotting fees or other up front expenditures 
if a product launch is not as successful as anticipated  additional promotional expenditures may be needed to sustain sales and reduce possible returns 
most vendors retain certain rights as they relate to product returns 
a broad product launch  one in which a new product is introduced into thousands of retail outlets  can cause a strain on corporate resources since inventories must be produced and delivered 
the resulting sales increase also leads to an increase in accounts receivable with customers 
nutritional supplements must maintain potency levels during their selling life 
as a result  products must be stamped with an expiration date and retailers will not accept product with limited shelf life into their warehouses 
shelf life issues require a high degree of supply chain management of raw materials and finished goods to ensure that shelf life is maximized and that the out of date inventory is minimized 
the competition for shelf space at retailers is intense 
our sales people have ongoing discussions with our retail customers with regards to the allocation of shelf space and the level of promotional support for products 
retailers look to their vendors for promotional support for the products on their shelves in order to maximize sales 
vendors such as natrol look to retailers for advantageous placement of their products and promotion of their products within stores and within a retailer s promotional media such as newspaper advertisements placed by retailers 
the cost of promotions and support to the retailer on the part of vendors such as natrol can be very high and management must continually review promotional efforts with retailers to ensure that sales are profitable 
during  we were challenged by nearly all of the issues outlined above 
our carb intercept product line was introduced in and sales were built steadily in and and we shipped million of carb intercept products in but  toward the end of  negative publicity began to surface regarding the low carbohydrate atkins diet and lifestyle 
the publicity caused consumers to change their attitude toward low carbohydrate products 
the result was that sales of carb intercept declined in to million  which resulted in our losing more than million in gross profit 
the sharp decline in carb intercept sales had the additional impact of making previously good raw material and finished goods inventory obsolete because the product would expire before it could be used or sold 
this problem caused us to write down inventory by approximately  the write down reduced our gross profit 
we also faced unusual margin pressure due to the rapidly increasing cost of two important raw materials  coenzyme q coq and whey 
coq accounts for a little more than of our sales volume and whey products account for a little more than of our sales volume 
the average raw material price of coq in was higher than in  which resulted in our spending approximately million more than we would have if the pricing of coq had remained at levels 
we were unable to pass much of this cost to consumers via price increases 
similarly  whey product pricing increased which cost us approximately million relative to and as with coq  very little of the extra cost could be passed on to consumers 
fortunately  the trends for appear to be that pricing for both of these categories is on the decline 
we cannot predict if the cost of these items will fully return to their levels 
another issue that we faced in was consolidation within the drug store channel of trade 
in late  the eckerd drug store chain was sold by its parent company  jc penney  to the cvs and the brooks drugstore chains 
when one chain is bought by another  the vendors to the acquired retailer will often gain or lose business depending upon the intent of the acquiring company 
in the case of the eckerd acquisition  eckerd carried more of our products than did cvs and brooks at the time of the acquisition 
the result was that during  cvs and brooks eckerd returned million more of our products than in the number of our items carried in the old eckerd stores was reduced 
we are working to expand our shelf space at these chains but there is no guarantee that our shelf space will expand in the immediate future 
how a consolidation will affect a vendor is difficult to quantify in exact terms immediately after the announced consolidating event because representatives of the acquirer and the acquired business are most often difficult to reach and it systems in each company typically do not work well with each other 
the result is that smaller vendors often have to wait for months before be able to obtain an accurate description of the acquirer s plans 
the returns are posted as a reduction of gross sales thereby reducing net revenue 
in  we also introduced brainspeed  a new product line in the cognitive care category 
the products were introduced in select retailers at mid year 
as is the challenge with any new product  the brainspeed product line needs to gain the attention of consumers and to this end we have advertised and used other means to build consumer awareness such as publicity to heighten the product line s visibility 
in  we will continue to build awareness and  hopefully  repeat business 
but  garnering the support of consumers is not a quick process and there is no guarantee that brainspeed will be the long term success we hope it to be 
future challenges include overcoming the issues we faced in and returning to profitability 
we have worked to better manage inventory and cut other costs 
we continually seek to develop new products that consumers will want 
but  replacing the approximately million of lost carb intercept volume is difficult in the best of circumstances 
seeking to be a product leader and innovator remains a core part of our business strategy and we continue to believe that additional opportunities for growth exist 
however  capitalizing upon these opportunities may require us to modify our business strategy which  itself  poses risk 
subsequent events on february   the board of directors of natrol  inc the company appointed mr 
wayne bos as a director of the company and appointed him chief executive officer designate and president designate and he assumed all responsibilities relative to this position on march  in connection with his appointment  mr 
bos was awarded fully vested options to purchase  shares of the company s common stock with a strike price of per share 
the strike price was equal to the price of the last reported trade immediately prior to the time the board determined to grant this option and therefore reflects the fair market value of our common stock at the time of the grant 
for a period of three years  mr 
bos s ability to sell the majority of the shares he receives upon exercise of these options is restricted  with the restrictions lapsing based upon the stock price reaching defined hurdles 
the grant is subject to shareholder approval 
in february  the tenant who leases  square feet of space in our  square foot shipping facility formally notified us of its intent to vacate the facility and we have commissioned a broker to find a new tenant 
this tenant was in arrears of its rent obligations at december  although this tenant is contractually bound for the entire term of the lease  and although we are attempting to collect rent due us  there is no guarantee that the tenant will be able to pay us for rent owed even if a formal legal settlement is reached 
rental income during was posted only as cash payments were received 
although the notification by the tenant was a subsequent event  in december  the company expensed deferred rent and prepaid commissions  which were related to the lease with the tenant of critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we sell our products to retail outlets through a direct sales force and a national distributor network 
we recognize revenue from sales only after product is shipped and risk of loss is transferred 
we have no consignment customers 
net sales represent product shipped less actual and estimated future returns  spoilage allowances  allowances for product deemed to be unsaleable by customers  and slotting fees  rebates and other expenditures which  using generally accepted accounting principles gaap should be accounted for as reductions of revenue 
estimates and allowances are based upon known claims and an estimate of additional returns 
we believe the amount of future returns can be reasonably estimated 
our recognition of revenue from sales to distributors and retailers is impacted by agreements giving them rights to return damaged and outdated products as well as the fact that as a practical business matter  our sales force  along with our customers  is constantly working to ensure the profitability of our products within retailers by rotating slow moving items out of stores and replacing those products with what we and the retailer expect will be more profitable  faster selling items 
our obligation to accept returns of slow moving items may or may not be contractually bound 
our accounting and sales staffs regularly monitor historical patterns of returns from individual customers as well as current and ongoing sales to customers and  when information is available  consumer purchases of our products from the our customers 
we have determined that historical trends with respect to product sales of individual items are not a good barometer of future returns of those items 
excellent historical sales with few returns does not guarantee strong future sales and a low level of future returns 
this is due to a number of factors including changes in consumer demand for individual items  increasing or decreasing competition from industry participants  different levels of periodic support from retail partners  the amount of advertising with which we may be able to support products  and  favorable or unfavorable publicity 
products that sell well at one account may not sell well at another account due to factors that are unique to the particular customer such as poor vs 
excellent product placement on the customer s shelves  the fact that customers do not carry the same products  the carrying by a customer of more or fewer competitive products  and pricing at the retail level which is controlled by the customer 
in order to reduce the amount of subjectivity when analyzing sales trends and reserving for future returns  we perform a detailed analyses of trends at each of our major customers  ie  those customers who have historically accounted for the bulk of returns 
this analysis takes into account sales patterns of individual products at each customer on a customer by customer basis as well as inventory levels at the customer  scheduled promotional events  and the probability that items will be discontinued 
we believe that this analysis creates appropriate estimates of necessary future reserves 
our use of the term returns throughout this document includes estimates of our liability for damaged and outdated product within our channels of trade 
over the last three years  returns and estimates of return liability were as follows in thousands description balance at beginning of year charged to cost and expense deductions balance at end of year allowance for sales returns year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  represents actual returns in recent years  as a result of a combination of the factors described above  gross sales have been materially offset by the estimated amount of returns and other charges to arrive at net sales 
it is also possible that returns could increase rapidly and significantly in the future 
accordingly  although we attempt to eliminate as much subjectivity as we believe possible  we note that estimating product returns requires a degree of management judgment 
for this reason  the accounting estimate related to product returns is a critical accounting estimate 
the total amount charged against sales for returns and damages and outdates in   and was million  million and million  respectively 
impairment of goodwill 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill not be amortized 
in accordance with the adoption  we identified all reporting units in conjunction with the provisions of sfas no 
and allocated all goodwill accordingly 
beginning in  goodwill began to be evaluated for impairment annually  or more frequently if changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable 
in  we tested goodwill for impairment using the two step process prescribed in sfas no 
the first step is a screen for potential impairment  while the second step measures the amount of the impairment  if any 
we performed the impairment test and determined that there was potential impairment of the natrol segment 
we performed the second step as of january  for the natrol segment and determined that the goodwill balance of  was impaired 
the impairment loss was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  net of income tax benefit of approximately million for the year ended december  the remaining goodwill balance at december  and was approximately million 
in the fourth quarter of  we completed our annual goodwill impairment testing and determined that goodwill was not impaired 
additionally  during march  we settled litigation with the former owners of prolab nutrition  inc we received million in cash  which was reflected in the financial statements for the quarter ending march  as a reduction of goodwill 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 we performed our annual impairment test of goodwill during the fourth quarter of and and concluded that it was not impaired in either year 
in and  we reported only one operating unit and  as a result  the impairment test was done for the company as a whole 
in all years in which impairment was tested  we considered a number of variables including  but not limited to  the market capitalization of the company  estimates of future earnings and discounted cash flows  third party assessments of the value of the company and transactions involving the purchase and sale of businesses similar to ours 
income taxes 
deferred income tax assets have been established for future tax benefits related to deductible goodwill for which we have recorded an impairment charge and for certain other temporary items  the aggregate benefit of which is approximately million 
realization of this benefit is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income in future periods 
although it is not assured  management believes it is more likely than not that the carrying value of this benefit will be realized 
the amount of the benefit that is considered realizable  however  could change if estimates of future taxable income are adjusted in future periods 
inventory 
we monitor inventory and analyze it on a monthly basis 
cycle counts are taken daily to verify inventory levels 
in addition  we analyze the movement of items within inventory in an effort to determine the likelihood that inventory will be sold or used before expiration dates are reached 
we provide an allowance against that portion of inventory that we believe is unlikely to be sold or used before expiration dates are reached 
at december   inventory allowances were approximately million 
the reserves are as high as they are because a large amount of inventory  such as carb intercept inventory that has been reserved for  has not been physically removed from our inventory 
until the inventory is physically removed  reserves remain in place 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
we recognize revenue from sales only after product is shipped 
we have no consignment sales 
net sales represent product shipped less actual and estimated future returns  spoilage allowances  allowances for product deemed to be unsaleable by customers  free goods shipped to customers for promotional or other purposes  rebates  slotting fees and other promotional expenditures 
estimates and allowances are based upon known claims and an estimate of additional returns when the amount of future returns from customers can be reasonably estimated 
net sales in decreased  or million  to million from million in net sales is calculated by subtracting from gross revenue certain expenses such as incentive rebates  shipping damages  and returns 
gross revenue decreased less than net sales because total deductions from gross revenue were million more in than in returns in were more than in this expense was offset in part by reducing other discounts 
off invoice promotional discounts in particular were million less in than in as discussed in the overview section of md a  the largest relative change in returns came from the cvs  brooks  eckerd drug store chains after the purchase of eckerd drug by the cvs and brooks drug store chains 
the returns from this group were million higher in than in the net revenue of natrol including laci le beau  epi  and prolab changed as follows from to years ended december  in thousands net revenue natrol including laci le beau epi prolab total net revenue the overriding reason behind the fall off in natrol sales was the decline in the carb intercept line of products 
gross shipments of carb intercept products fell from million in to million in this decline was partially offset by growth in other areas  including the introduction of the brainspeed product line in june net sales of the epi division fell million in during  we continued to de emphasize the epi division  a process that began in during  we ended our supply relationships with conagra  which had been supplying us garlic and vegetable powders  and with larex  which had been supplying us with arabinogalactan 
furthermore  in  we re examined the profitability of all contract manufacturing customers and made the decision to stop producing items that did not deliver minimum profit levels 
although revenue has declined  the net contribution of the epi division has improved due to higher margins on the remaining business and lower expenses to maintain the business that we now have 
the prolab business fell nearly million in a key factor was our canadian distributor whose sales in declined million when compared to during the year  we worked to resolve issues with this distributor as they relate to contractual minimum purchases  pricing  and strategies for building the prolab brand 
the issues were not resolved to what we believe are our best interests and as a result  at the end of the first quarter of  we stopped shipping this distributor product 
we are contractually prevented from using a different distributor in canada outside of quebec until we believe that despite the immediate problems this presents in terms of gross sales and net income  our long term prospects in canada are better if we sell directly in canada or find another distributor who is willing to build the prolab brand in a manner we believe is appropriate 
we believe that an additional reason for the decline in prolab sales has been the high cost of product to consumers 
the price of whey products increased during forcing us to implement two price increases 
the price increases did not make up for the lost margin to us 
even so  consumers purchased less from us in response to the price increases they received 
during  only the ester c product category accounted for more than of our net revenue 
in  both ester c and carb intercept each accounted for more than revenue 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased or million to as compared to million in gross margin decreased to from 
gross margin fluctuates depending upon product mix  the cost of raw materials  labor and overhead as well as the difference between gross revenue and net sales revenue 
as noted above under the caption net sales  deductions from gross revenue were more in than in  which negatively affected gross margins 
had the gross margin remained in  our gross profit would have fallen million due to the lower volume of sales 
a second important factor in the million drop in gross profit is the high cost of two important raw materials in  coq and whey 
coq accounts a little more than of our sales volume and whey products account for a little more than of our sales volume 
the average price of coq in was approximately higher than it was in  which resulted in our spending approximately million more than we would have if the pricing of coq had remained at levels 
we were unable to pass much of this cost to consumers via price increases 
similarly  whey product pricing increased which cost us approximately million relative to and as with coq  very little of the extra cost could be passed on to consumers 
fortunately  the trends for appear to be that pricing for both of these categories is on the decline 
we cannot predict if the cost of these items will fully return to their levels 
another significant issue was the sharp decline in carb intercept sales  which had the additional impact of making previously good raw material and finished goods inventory obsolete because the product would expire before it could be used or sold 
this problem caused us to write down inventory by approximately  reducing our gross profit 
the remainder of the difference in the gross profit was due to product mix  some increase in overhead and other promotional expenditures that affected margins 
selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising and promotional expenses  costs of distribution  and related payroll expenses and commissions 
selling and marketing expenses decreased by million or to million from million in of the million net decrease in selling and marketing expenses  approximately  was due to a decrease in the cost of shipping product because of the lower sales volume experienced in sales and marketing payroll was million less in than in the remainder of the decrease in expenditures was due to an overall decline other sales and marketing expenses 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs related to general management functions  research and development  finance  accounting and information systems  as well as professional fees 
general and administrative expenses increased  or to million from million in we spent  more on our sarbanes oxley compliance efforts in than in and  more on r d 
we documented our processes and controls in  using an outside consultant as part of our effort to meet the auditor attestation requirements of the sarbanes oxley law 
continuing to expand our r d capabilities is a core element of our business strategy  and  in  we continued this process 
these additional expenses were partially offset by  of lower legal expenditures and  in lower administrative payroll as well as minor reductions in other expense areas 
interest income expense  net 
interest expense was approximately  in versus  in interest income was approximately  in versus  in interest expense and interest income increased in as a result of rising interest rates in income tax provision benefit 
we had an income tax benefit of million in as opposed to an income tax expense of million in our effective tax rate was in versus in the difference in our effective tax rate was primarily due to tax benefits we were able to claim as a result of an r d tax credit study performed during the fourth quarter of year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
net sales in increased  or million  to million from million in net sales in were positively affected by a lower level of returns than in the level of returns  which includes charges from customers for damaged or outdated product  was approximately of gross revenue in as compared to of gross revenue in other deductions from gross revenue fell from in to in these other deductions are due to payment discounts given to customers for timely payment  audit claims from customers for such items as shipping shortages  and promotional support such as rebate incentives and pricing reductions which  according to gaap rules  must be recorded as reductions of revenue 
the level of promotional support recorded as a reduction of revenue declined from of gross shipments in to of gross shipments in the remainder of the savings was due to fewer payment discounts and a lower level of audit claims from customers 
the level of gross revenue in any period is a result of many factors including customer relations and the popularity of our products with consumers 
during  we improved the level of sales with club stores and mass market merchants and certain categories of products  weight loss products in particular  proved to be popular with consumers 
sales gains in these areas were partially offset by the loss of sales with other customers and declining sales of certain other product categories 
years ended december  in thousands net revenue natrol including laci le beau epi prolab total net revenue natrol products including laci le beau grew approximately relative to the largest sales declines were due to slower sales within the epi raw materials division 
bulk ingredient sales accounted for of gross sales in approximately of these sales or million were generated through the sales of garlic and other vegetable powders 
the balance of sales was from the sale of arabinogalactan 
sales of garlic and vegetable powders fell approximately in reasons for the decline include market conditions and competition from domestic and international suppliers 
this decline was partially offset by sales of arabinogalactan 
during  two product categories each accounted for more than of gross shipments 
during  only one category accounted for more than of gross shipments 
no customer accounted for or more of gross sales in or our top customers accounted for approximately and of our gross sales in and  respectively 
gross profit 
gross profit increased or million to million in as compared to million in gross margin increased to in from in gross margin fluctuates depending upon product mix  the cost of raw materials  labor and overhead as well as the difference between gross revenue and net sales revenue 
as noted above under the caption net sales  deductions from gross revenue were less in percentage terms in than in and this positively affected gross margins 
selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising and promotional expenses  costs of distribution  and related payroll expenses and commissions 
selling and marketing expenses increased by or million to million in from million in of the million net increase in selling and marketing expenses  approximately  was due to the increased cost of shipping product  approximately  was due to increased promotional expenditures  approximately  was due to increased public relations expenditures  and approximately  was due to increases in payroll outside of the shipping department and brokers commissions 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs related to general management functions  research and development  finance  accounting and information systems  as well as professional fees 
general and administrative expenses decreased or million in from million in to million in the largest savings in general and administrative expenses came from the closing of prolab s headquarters facility in october and the consolidation of all administrative functions for prolab into natrol s headquarters facility 
this consolidation reduced net payroll by approximately  when compared to we also saved approximately  when compared to through the implementation of our self insurance program for product liability insurance in july these savings were partially offset by the establishment of a research and development department within the administrative area in october we spent approximately  more on this department in than in also offsetting savings generated by the prolab closure and the self insurance program was our bonus incentive program 
this program was established in and resulted in the granting of approximately  in incentive payments to qualified employees 
interest income expense  net 
interest expense was approximately  in versus interest expense of approximately  in interest income in was approximately  versus approximately  in interest expense decreased in because we had less debt outstanding during the year 
interest income increased due to the average level of cash on hand earning interest 
income tax provision benefit 
income taxes were million in as compared to approximately  in the difference in income tax expense was primarily due to the differences in taxable income earned in versus our tax rate was in versus in the difference was due primarily to the fact that the some of our expenses cannot be expensed for tax purposes 
when earnings are at a low level  these permanent adjustments to taxable income have a proportionately greater effect on our tax rate than when total earnings are at a higher level 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had working capital of million  as compared to million in working capital at december  in  net cash used by operating activities was million versus million provided by operations in and net cash used of million in in  our net loss of million and a  net change in non cash charges  both of which used cash  were partially offset by a  net change in operating assets and liabilities which provided cash 
changes in operating assets and liabilities provided cash due a million increase in accounts payable  an  decrease in accounts receivable  a  decrease in income taxes receivable  a  increase in accrued expenses and a  decrease in pre 
aid expenses  which were partially offset by a million increase in accounts payable  and a  decrease in accrued payroll 
the increase in accounts payable and inventory were primarily due to an opportunistic purchase of raw materials of approximately million in late december the decrease in accrued payroll was due to the fact that no bonus payments were awarded under our management incentive bonus program in due to our loss in approximately  in bonus payments were granted for the year ended december  and this amount was accrued as a liability on our balance sheet at december  at december   the number of days sales outstanding in trade receivable was approximately days versus days and days in and  respectively 
net cash used in investing activities was  versus net cash provided by investing activities of approximately  in versus net cash used of million in we invested approximately  in plant and equipment in and other assets decreased  in  we invested  in plant and equipment and other assets grew by approximately  during the year 
these uses of cash were offset by the receipt of million due to the settlement of litigation with the former owners of prolab 
in  we deposited million with an insurance company to fund our self insurance program 
aside from this investment which is fully refundable should we decide not to self insure  nearly all of the cash used for investing activities from to has been for plant and equipment 
net cash used by financing activities in amounted to  as opposed to cash provided by financing activities of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in  we repaid approximately  on our long term debt 
we also raised approximately  from the sale of stock to employees exercising stock option or purchasing stock through the employee stock purchasing program espp 
in  we borrowed  in a five year note to purchase equipment  paid back  of debt and received  through the exercise of employee stock options and the sale of stock to employees through our espp 
during  we reduced debt by approximately  this use of cash was offset by approximately  raised through the exercise of employee stock option or the sale of stock to employees through our espp 
as of december   we had million in outstanding debt versus million at the end of all but  related to the term note cited above is related to a mortgage on our manufacturing headquarters facility and a mortgage on our shipping facility 
our cash balance at the close of was approximately excluding million in restricted cash as opposed to approximately million and million excluding million in restricted cash at the end of and  respectively 
we currently do not have a line of credit established 
we are  however  attempting to secure a line of credit 
although we believe that a line of credit should be obtainable  there is no guarantee that financial institutions will be willing to provide capital to us 
also  in providing us with additional funds  potential lenders may seek to institute covenants restricting us from certain activities and if we think it necessary to borrow funds with these restrictions in place  we may find that our ability to compete effectively in our market sector is hindered 
in order to meet our long term liquidity needs  we may be required to incur additional indebtedness or issue additional equity and debt securities  subject to market and other conditions 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
the failure to raise the funds necessary to finance our future cash requirements or consummate future acquisitions could adversely affect our ability to pursue our business strategy and could negatively affect our operations in future periods 
we believe that our cash balance together with cash generated from operations and the potential to borrow funds and raise capital should be sufficient to fund our anticipated working capital needs and planned capital expenditures for the next months 
however  if we do not meet our operating plan we may also need additional borrowings to fund working capital needs 
we currently have no outstanding debt on our books other than mortgage debt and the five year term note that is secured by our non real estate assets 
the balance of this term note on december  was  recently issued accounting standards in may  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
 accounting changes and error corrections 
this new standard replaces apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and fasb statement no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements  and represents another step in the fasb s goal to converge its standards with those issued by the iasb 
among other changes  statement requires that a voluntary change in accounting principle be applied retrospectively with all prior period financial statements presented on the new accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to do so 
statement also provides that a change in method of depreciating or amortizing a long lived nonfinancial asset be accounted for as a change in estimate prospectively that was effected by a change in accounting principle  and correction of errors in previously issued financial statements should be termed a restatement 
the new standard is effective for accounting changes and correction of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption of this standard is permitted for accounting changes and correction of errors made in fiscal years beginning after june  in march  the sec released staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payment sab  which provides interpretive guidance related to the interaction between sfas r and certain sec rules and regulations 
it also provides the sec staff s views regarding valuation of share based payment arrangements 
in april  the sec amended the compliance dates for sfas r  to allow companies to implement the standard at the beginning of their next fiscal year  instead of the next reporting period beginning after june  in february  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
 accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments 
this statement amends fasb statements no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
as we do not issue or expect to issue hybrid financial instruments  we do not believe this pronouncement will have any material effect on our financial reporting 
contractual obligations and commitments the following table discloses our obligations and commitments to make future payments under contractual obligations at december  payment due by period total less than year years years thereafter in thousands note payable interest on notes payable leases total we lease part of our shipping facility and future minimum lease payments due to us according to the lease are in thousands total however  as of year end  our tenant was in arrears 
in february   this tenant formally notified us of its intent to vacate the facility and we have commissioned a broker to find a new tenant 
although the tenant is responsible for all rent through the term of the lease  and although we are attempting to collect rent due us  there is no guarantee that the tenant will be able to pay us for rent owed even if a formal legal settlement is reached 
impact of inflation generally  inflation has not had a material impact on our historical operations or profitability 
we do not believe that the increase in the pricing of coq and whey are a reflection of the general inflation in the economy 
inflation affects the cost of raw materials  goods and services used by us 
in recent years  inflation has been modest 
the competitive environment somewhat limits our ability to recover higher costs resulting from inflation by raising prices 
we seek to mitigate the adverse effects of inflation primarily through improved productivity and cost containment programs 
we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our results of operations for the periods presented  except with respect to payroll related costs  and other costs arising from or related to government imposed regulations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risks is limited to interest rate risks 
the risks related to foreign currency exchange rates are immaterial and we do not use derivative financial instruments 
we are subject to interest rate market risk associated with our bank debt 
even so  we do not believe the risk associated with such borrowing is significant 
additionally  we do not believe that the risk is significant for our long term debt due to the low fixed rates and relative insignificance of the fixed long term debt to our balance sheet 
our long term debt is comprised of two fixed rate notes with a total principal balance of approximately  collateralized by our headquarters building and our shipping facility and one variable rate note with a principal balance of approximately  collateralized by our general assets 
the table below presents principal cash flows and related interest rates by fiscal year of maturity 
expected year of maturity thereafter total fair value december  in thousands notes payable our estimate of the fair value of our notes payable was based on an analysis of current market interest rates 
the weighted average interest rate for all years presented is for the fixed rate notes and for the variable rate note
