item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion of our results of operations and financial condition in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that are based upon current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results and the timing of certain events may differ materially from those projected in such forward looking statements due to a number of factors  including those discussed in the section entitled forward looking statements on page we have restated our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended june  and and for the nine months ended march  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations reflects the restatements described in notes and to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a client focused company that creates and implements innovative solutions to the challenges facing america s real estate  energy  environmental and infrastructure markets  and we are a leading provider of technical  financial  risk management and construction services to industry and government clients across the country 
we derive our revenue from fees for professional and technical services 
as a service company  we are labor intensive rather than capital intensive 
our revenue is driven by our ability to attract and retain qualified and productive employees  identify business opportunities  secure new and renew existing client contracts  provide outstanding services to our clients and execute projects successfully 
our income loss from operations is derived from our ability to generate revenue and collect cash under our contracts in excess of our direct costs  subcontractor costs  other contract costs  and general and administrative g a expenses 
the types of contracts with our clients and the approximate percentage of net service revenue nsr for the years ended june   and from each contract type are as follows years ended june  time and materials fixed price or lump sum cost type with various fee arrangements in the course of providing our services we routinely subcontract services 
generally  these subcontractor costs are passed through to our clients and  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states and consistent with industry practice  are included in gross revenue 
because subcontractor services can change significantly from project to project  changes in gross revenue may not be indicative of business trends 
accordingly  we also report nsr  net of subcontractor costs and other direct reimbursable costs  which is gross revenue less the cost of subcontractor services and other direct reimbursable costs  and our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations uses nsr as a point of reference 
for analytical purposes only  we categorize our revenue into two types acquisition and organic 
acquisition revenue consists of revenue derived from newly acquired companies during the first twelve months following their respective acquisition dates 
organic revenue consists of our total revenue less any acquisition revenue 
our cost of services includes professional compensation and related benefits  together with certain direct and indirect overhead costs such as rents  utilities and travel 
professional compensation represents the majority of these costs 
our g a expenses are comprised primarily of our corporate headquarters costs related to corporate executive management  finance  accounting  administration and legal 
these costs are generally unrelated to specific client projects and can vary as expenses are incurred to support corporate activities and initiatives 
our revenue  expenses and operating results may fluctuate significantly from year to year as a result of numerous factors  including unanticipated changes in contract performance that may affect profitability  particularly with contracts that are fixed price or have funding limits  seasonality of the spending cycle of our public sector clients  notably state and local government entities  and the spending patterns of our commercial sector clients  budget constraints experienced by our federal  state and local government clients  acquisitions or the integration of acquired companies  divestitures or discontinuance of operating units  employee hiring  utilization and turnover rates  the number and significance of client contracts commenced and completed during the period  creditworthiness and solvency of clients  the ability of our clients to terminate contracts without penalties  delays incurred in connection with a contract  the size  scope and payment terms of contracts  contract negotiations on change orders and collections of related accounts receivable  the timing of expenses incurred for corporate initiatives  reductions in the prices of services offered by our competitors  litigation  changes in accounting rules  and general economic or political conditions 
as previously announced  effective as of december   richard ellison  our chief executive officer retired from that position and christopher vincze  our chief operating officer was appointed as chief executive officer 
on march   we announced the appointment of timothy belton as our new chief operating officer 
in addition  effective april   harold c 
elston  jr  our chief financial officer retired from that position  and carl d 
paschetag  jr 
was appointed as chief financial officer  effective april  as of november   we entered into a forbearance agreement and global amendment to credit documents with wachovia bank and certain other lenders in connection with our credit agreement 
under the terms of the forbearance agreement  our lenders agreed to continue to make loans under the credit agreement up to million and to forbear in the exercise of their rights and remedies under the credit agreement through january  in january  the forbearance period was amended and extended to july  on march   we issued an aggregate of  shares of common stock for per share  for an aggregate purchase price of million  to certain accredited investors 
as a result of that equity financing  the maximum amount available under the credit agreement was reduced to million and gradually reduces further to million by june  however  the forbearance agreement contains a covenant that requires us to maintain a minimum availability of million increasing to million by virtue of cash received in the pacland settlement  effectively reducing the maximum amount available under the credit agreement 
critical accounting policies our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and related notes 
actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions 
we use our best judgment in the assumptions used to value these estimates  which are based on current facts and circumstances  prior experience and other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable 
our accounting policies are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report on form k 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements and are the policies which are most critical in the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations revenue recognition we recognize contract revenue in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts sop 
pursuant to sop  certain exit strategy contracts are segmented into two profit centers remediation and operation  maintenance and monitoring 
we earn our revenue from fixed price  time and materials and cost plus contracts as described below 
fixed price we recognize revenue on fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion method 
under this method for revenue recognition  we estimate the progress towards completion to determine the amount of revenue and profit to recognize on all significant contracts 
we generally utilize an efforts expended cost to cost approach in applying the percentage of completion method under which revenue is earned in proportion to total costs incurred divided by total costs expected to be incurred 
under the percentage of completion method  recognition of profit is dependent upon the accuracy of a variety of estimates  including engineering progress  materials quantities  achievement of milestones and other incentives  penalty provisions  labor productivity and cost estimates 
such estimates are based on various judgments we make with respect to those factors and can be difficult to accurately determine until the project is significantly underway 
due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process  actual completion costs often vary from estimates 
pursuant to sop  if estimated total costs on any contract indicate a loss  we charge the entire estimated loss to operations in the period the loss first becomes known 
prior to completion  our recognized profit margins on any fixed price contract depend on our estimates and will increase to the extent that our actual costs are below the estimated amounts 
conversely  if our costs exceed these estimates  our profit margins will decrease and we may realize a loss on a project 
if our actual costs exceed the original estimate  we must obtain a change order or contract modification  or successfully prevail in a claim  in order to receive payment for the additional costs 
unit price contracts are a subset of fixed price contracts 
under unit price contracts  our clients pay us a set fee for each service or unit of production 
we recognize revenue under unit price contracts as we complete the related service transaction for our clients 
if our costs per service transaction exceed our original estimates  our profit margins will decrease and we may realize a loss on the project unless we can obtain a change order or contract modification  or successfully prevail in a claim  in order to receive payment for the additional costs 
time and materials under our time and materials contracts  we negotiate hourly billing rates and charge our clients based on the actual time that we expend on a project 
in addition  clients reimburse us for our actual out of pocket costs of materials and other direct reimbursable expenses that we incur in connection with our performance under the contract 
our profit margins on time and materials contracts fluctuate based on actual labor and overhead costs that we directly charge or allocate to contracts compared to negotiated billing rates 
revenue on time and materials contracts is recognized based on the actual number of hours we spend on the projects plus any actual out of pocket costs of materials and other direct reimbursable expenses that we incur on the projects 
cost plus cost plus fixed fee 
under cost plus fixed fee contracts  we charge our clients for our costs  including both direct and indirect costs  plus a fixed negotiated fee 
in negotiating a cost plus fixed fee contract  we estimate all recoverable direct and indirect costs and then add a fixed profit component 
the total estimated cost plus the negotiated fee represents the total contract value 
we recognize revenue based on the actual labor costs  plus non labor costs we incur  plus the portion of the fixed fee we have earned to date 
we invoice for our services in accordance with agreed upon billing schedules 
cost plus fixed rate 
under our cost plus fixed rate contracts  we charge clients for our costs plus negotiated rates based on our indirect costs 
in negotiating a cost plus fixed rate contract  we estimate all recoverable direct and indirect costs and then add a profit component  which is a percentage of total recoverable costs  to arrive at a total dollar estimate for the project 
we recognize revenue based on the actual total costs we have expended plus the applicable fixed fee 
if the actual total costs are lower than the total costs we have estimated  our revenue from that project will be lower than originally estimated 
change orders claims change orders are modifications of an original contract that effectively change the provisions of the contract 
change orders typically result from changes in scope  specifications or design  manner of performance  facilities  equipment  materials  sites  or period of completion of the work 
claims are amounts in excess of agreed contract price that we seek to collect from our clients or others for client caused delays  errors in specifications and designs  contract terminations  change orders that are either in dispute or are unapproved as to both scope and price or other causes of unanticipated additional contract costs 
costs related to change orders and claims are recognized when they are incurred 
change orders are included in total estimated contract revenue when it is probable that the change order will result in a bona fide addition to contract value and can be reliably estimated 
claims are included in total estimated contract revenues only to the extent that contract costs related to the claims have been incurred and when it is probable that the claim will result in a bona fide addition to contract value which can be reliably estimated 
no profit is recognized on claims until final settlement occurs 
this can lead to a situation where costs are recognized in one period and revenues are recognized in a subsequent period when a client agreement is obtained or claims resolution occurs 
other contract matters we have fixed price exit strategy contracts to remediate environmental conditions at contaminated sites 
under most exit strategy contracts  the majority of the contract price is deposited into a restricted account with an insurer 
these proceeds  less any insurance premiums and fees for a policy to cover potential cost overruns and other factors  are held by the insurer and used to pay us as work is performed 
the arrangement with the insurer provides for the deposited funds to earn interest at the one year constant maturity t bill rate 
the interest is recorded when earned and reported as interest income from contractual arrangements on our consolidated statement of operations 
the net proceeds held by the insurer  and interest growth thereon  are recorded as an asset current and long term restricted investment on our balance sheet  with a corresponding liability related to the net proceeds current and long term deferred revenue 
consistent with our other fixed price contracts  we recognize revenue on exit strategy contracts using the percentage of completion method 
under this method for revenue recognition  we estimate the progress towards completion to determine the amount of revenue and profit to recognize on these contracts 
we utilize an efforts expended cost to cost approach in applying the percentage of completion method under which revenue is recognized in proportion to total costs incurred divided by total costs expected to be incurred 
when determining the extent of progress towards completion on exit strategy contracts  prepaid insurance premiums and fees are amortized  on a straight line basis  to cost incurred over the life of the related insurance policy 
pursuant to sop  certain exit strategy contracts are segmented into two profit centers remediation and operation  maintenance and monitoring 
in instances where we establish that our costs will exceed the contract value and interest growth thereon and such costs are covered by insurance  we will record an insurance recovery up to the amount of our insured costs 
an insurance gain  that is  an amount to be recovered in excess of our recorded costs  is not recognized until all contingencies relating to our insurance claim have been resolved 
we define the resolution of contingencies  with respect to insurance claims  as the receipt of insurance proceeds 
insurance recoveries are reported as insurance recoverable on our consolidated statement of operations 
pursuant to sop  if estimated total costs on any contract indicate a loss  we charge the entire estimated loss to operations in the period the loss first becomes known 
federal acquisition regulations far  which are applicable to our federal government contracts and are partially incorporated in many local and state agency contracts  limit the recovery of certain specified indirect costs on contracts 
cost plus contracts covered by far  and certain state and local agencies  also require an audit of actual costs and provide for upward or downward adjustments if actual recoverable costs differ from billed recoverable costs 
most of our federal government contracts are subject to termination at the discretion of the client 
contracts typically provide for reimbursement of costs incurred and payment of fees earned through the date of such termination 
these contracts are subject to audit by the government  primarily the defense contract audit agency dcaa  which reviews our overhead rates  operating systems and cost proposals 
during the course of its audits  the dcaa may disallow costs if it determines that we improperly accounted for such costs in a manner inconsistent with cost accounting standards 
our last audit was for fiscal and resulted in a thousand adjustment 
historically  we have not had any material cost disallowances by the dcaa as a result of audit  however there can be no assurance that dcaa audits will not result in material cost disallowances in the future 
allowances for doubtful accounts allowances for doubtful accounts are maintained for estimated losses resulting from the failure of our clients to make required payments 
allowances for doubtful accounts have been determined through reviews of specific amounts deemed to be uncollectible and estimated write offs as a result of clients who have filed for bankruptcy protection  plus an allowance for other amounts for which some loss is determined to be probable based on current circumstances 
if the financial condition of clients or our assessment as to collectibility were to change  adjustments to the allowances may be required 
income taxes at june   we had approximately million of gross deferred income tax benefits 
the realization of a portion of these benefits is dependent on our estimates of future taxable income and our tax planning strategies 
an million valuation allowance has been recorded in relation to certain state loss carryforwards which will more likely than not expire unused and state deferred tax assets from which a benefit is not likely to be realized 
we believe that sufficient taxable income will be earned in the future to realize the remaining deferred income tax benefits 
however  the realization of these deferred income tax benefits can be impacted by changes to tax codes  statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels 
business acquisitions assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations are recorded at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date 
at june   we had approximately million of goodwill  representing the cost of acquisitions in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired companies 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment testing 
additionally  goodwill is tested between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value 
the assessment of goodwill involves the estimation of the fair value of our two reporting units as defined by sfas for the year ended june   our reporting units consisted of the engineering consulting group and the co energy group ceg 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  it became clear that a technical error which occurred during the installation phase of a long term contract would result in a significant reduction of total expected revenue under this contract 
the reduction of revenue put the seventeen year contract into a forward loss position 
the impact of the loss contract triggered an impairment evaluation of the goodwill within the ceg reporting unit 
based on our co investor s unwillingness to provide further financial support and a review of the financial condition of the investment  including near term prospects  we decided not to provide the additional investment necessary to allow for any anticipated recovery of ceg 
as required by sfas no 
 we performed a two step interim impairment test to confirm and quantify the impairment 
during step one  we determined that the goodwill recorded in its ceg reporting unit was impaired because the fair value of the reporting unit was less than the carrying value of the reporting unit s net assets 
the fair value of the reporting unit was estimated using the discounted cash flow method 
in order to quantify the impairment  we performed step two by allocating the fair value of the ceg reporting unit to the reporting unit s individual assets and liabilities utilizing the purchase price allocation guidance of sfas the resulting implied value of the ceg reporting unit s goodwill was  primarily as a result of management s decision  subsequent to june   not to provide the additional investment necessary to allow for any anticipated recovery of ceg 
therefore  in june  we recorded an impairment charge of million to write off the goodwill 
in addition  we recorded a million impairment charge to write off the intangible assets of ceg 
we completed our required annual assessment of the recoverability of our engineering consulting reporting unit goodwill for fiscal in performing our goodwill assessment  we used current market capitalization and other factors as the best evidence of fair value 
for instance  we consider a number of other factors including the operating results  business plans  economic projections  anticipated future cash flows and a discount rate reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows 
there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment 
management completed this assessment during the third quarter of fiscal  based on information as of the december  assessment date  and determined that no impairment existed 
since the assessment date  our market capitalization has declined significantly  however  at june  and december   our market capitalization was in excess of our carrying amount  and management determined that no impairment existed at june  and december  there can be no assurance that future events will not result in an impairment of goodwill or other assets 
long lived assets we periodically assess the recoverability of the unamortized balance of our long lived assets including intangible assets based on expected future profitability and undiscounted expected cash flows and their contribution to our overall operations 
should the review indicate that the carrying value is not fully recoverable  the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the other intangible assets would be recognized as an impairment loss 
consolidation we determine whether we have a controlling financial interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity or a variable interest entity vie under generally accepted accounting principles 
voting interest entities 
voting interest entities are entities in which i the total equity investment at risk is sufficient to enable the entity to finance its activities independently and ii the equity holders have the obligation to absorb losses  the right to receive residual returns and the right to make decisions about the entity s activities 
voting interest entities are consolidated in accordance with accounting research bulletin arb no 
 consolidated financial statements  as amended 
arb no 
states that the usual condition for a controlling financial interest in an entity is ownership of a majority voting interest 
accordingly  we consolidate voting interest entities in which we have a majority voting interest 
variable interest entities 
vies are entities that lack one or more of the characteristics of a voting interest entity 
a controlling financial interest in a vie is present when an enterprise has a variable interest  or a combination of variable interests  that will absorb a majority of the vie s expected losses  receive a majority of the vie s expected residual returns  or both 
the enterprise with a controlling financial interest  known as the primary beneficiary  consolidates the vie 
in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation fin no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities  we consolidate all vies of which we are the primary beneficiary 
we determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of a vie by first performing a qualitative analysis of the vie that includes a review of  among other factors  its capital structure  contractual terms  which interests create or absorb variability  related party relationships and the design of the vie 
equity method investments 
when we do not have a controlling financial interest in an entity but exert significant influence over the entity s operating and financial policies generally defined as owning a voting interest of to for a corporation  or to for a partnership or limited liability company and have an investment in common stock or in substance common stock  we account for our investment in accordance with the equity method of accounting prescribed by accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock 
in fiscal  we made a investment in a privately held energy services contracting company co energy that specialized in the installation of ground source heat pump systems 
we have determined that co energy is a vie and became the primary beneficiary  resulting in the need to consolidate co energy into our financial statements beginning in april insurance matters  litigation and contingencies in the normal course of business we are subject to certain contractual guarantees and litigation 
generally  such guarantees relate to project schedules and performance 
most of the litigation involves us as a defendant in contractual disagreements  workers compensation  personal injury and other similar lawsuits 
we maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations 
however  we have elected to retain a portion of losses that may occur through the use of various deductibles  limits and retentions under our insurance programs 
this practice may subject us to some future liability for which we are only partially insured or are completely uninsured 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  we record in our consolidated balance sheets amounts representing our estimated losses from claims and settlements when such losses are deemed probable and estimable 
otherwise  these losses are expensed as incurred 
costs of defense are expensed as incurred 
if the estimate of a probable loss is a range  and no amount within the range is more likely  we accrue the minimum amount of the range 
as additional information about current or future litigation or other contingencies becomes available  management will assess whether such information warrants the recording of additional expenses relating to those contingencies 
such additional expenses could potentially have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
results of operations near term results have not been favorable 
despite this  nsr and backlog have remained solid 
we have begun to see evidence of increased market activity across a variety of the markets where we do business 
in addition  favorable federal legislation should stimulate activity in areas where we have strong market positions 
we expect our results of operations and financial condition during fiscal to be adversely affected by continued higher than expected operating costs  including an increase in costs relating to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of the impact of the sarbanes oxley regulatory structure on us became clear during the year ended june  while we expect the impact to be positive in the long term for streamlining our business  the complex requirements that have been imposed very rapidly on our diverse  decentralized operations have resulted in increased compliance costs  management diversion  and disruption to ongoing business processes 
bringing our individual business units processes into compliance is consistent with management s objective to fully integrate acquired operations but has added substantial short term costs 
in addition  costs associated with the restatements of our consolidated financial statements and costs relating to compliance with our agreements with our lenders including an increase in the interest on outstanding loans by an additional  our engagement of glass associates  inc for the provision of restructuring services  and legal costs are also expected to substantially increase our operating costs and adversely affect our fiscal results of operations and financial condition 
we also expect that the completion of certain loss and low margin contracts entered into prior to will negatively impact results during the greater part of fiscal we expect the majority of these contracts to be completed by the end of fiscal industry activity has picked up in recent months in concert with general economic activity 
backlog for exit strategy projects increased  and demand for our commercial land development and redevelopment services including brownfield development remains strong 
the labor market for civil engineers for land development projects remains tight in many areas  demanding an ongoing focus on recruiting senior professionals 
we envision continued growth in this market in with the passage by congress of the tea successor highway and transit bill  safetea lu  we anticipate a gradual ramping up of transportation activity in the states where we operate 
a number of our state dot projects have been delayed due to uncertainty in federal funding and budget problems at the state level 
with improving economic conditions in many states and certainty regarding federal funding  we anticipate increased activity in our transportation business in fiscal we recently streamlined our transportation business unit 
while municipal budgets are recovering from the budget constraints of earlier in the fiscal year  the market for municipal services remains competitive with increased local competition on bids 
our success with the port of houston s integrated security project has provided us with a strong position in that market 
the security market as a whole continues to mature and provide opportunities  though uncertainty remains regarding the total size of the commercial market outside of the direct expenditures by government on security personnel and hardware 
recent passage of the energy policy act should stimulate significant expansion of the domestic energy infrastructure market and provide us with opportunities in service areas where we are a major competitor  including permitting licensing of new or expanded energy facilities  engineering and construction for the electric transmission grid  and development of renewable energy and energy conservation projects 
in the course of providing our services  we routinely subcontract services 
generally  these subcontractor costs and other direct reimbursable charges are passed directly through to clients and  in accordance with gaap and industry practice  are included in gross revenue 
because subcontractor costs and other direct reimbursable charges can vary significantly from project to project  we consider nsr  which is gross revenue less subcontractor costs and other direct reimbursable charges  as a point of reference see page the following table presents the percentage relationships of items in the consolidated statements of operations to nsr years ended june  net service revenue interest income from contractual arrangements insurance recoverables operating costs and expenses cost of services general and administrative expenses goodwill and intangible asset write offs depreciation and amortization income loss from operations interest expense income loss before taxes  minority interest  equity earnings losses and accounting change federal and state income tax provision benefit minority interest income loss before equity earnings losses and accounting change equity in earnings losses from unconsolidated affiliates income loss before accounting change cumulative effect of accounting change net income loss dividends and accretion charges on preferred stock net income loss applicable to common shareholders our business consisted of two reportable segments in fiscal engineering consulting and ceg 
these segments were established based upon the different economic characteristics and risk profile of the segments 
engineering consulting provides consulting  engineering and construction management services to four principal market areas  namely real estate  energy  environmental and infrastructure 
ceg is a privately held energy services contracting company that specializes in the installation of ground source heat pump systems 
our ownership in ceg is 
we consolidated the operations of ceg for the fourth quarter of fiscal and all of fiscal as we determined that ceg is a variable interest entity and that we are the primary beneficiary 
prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal  we accounted for ceg as an equity investment 
our fiscal and financial statement disclosures have been restated to reflect ceg as a segment in all periods presented 
the following table presents the approximate percentage of nsr by reportable segment years ended june  engineering and consulting ceg results of operations by reportable segment compared to engineering consulting years ended june  change gross revenue less subcontractor costs and other direct reimbursable charges net service revenue cost of services income loss from operations equity in earnings from unconsolidated affiliates the following table presents the percentage relationship of certain items to nsr years ended june  net service revenue cost of services income loss from operations overall  the engineering consulting fiscal operating results were not favorable and were significantly impacted by poor operating performance and by certain charges 
specifically  operating performance results were not favorable due to organic operating costs added during the year despite declining organic revenue  primarily at our infrastructure offices  higher than anticipated sarbanes oxley compliance costs  and the postponement of several large government related emissions tests 
additionally  we incurred significant costs associated with loss contracts identified during fiscal we also recorded several charges  cumulatively equal to approximately million primarily in the fourth fiscal quarter  that were not incurred in fiscal or incurred to a lesser extent in fiscal including the following a pre tax charge of approximately million to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts for specific receivables that management determined it would no longer pursue pre tax charges of approximately million for contract loss reserves a pre tax charge of approximately million to write off certain distributed generation assets electrical generators  related equipment and engineering designs whose value has declined primarily due to high natural gas costs a pre tax charge of approximately million for restructuring costs to reduce and rebalance the workforce within a portion of our infrastructure group see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements a pre tax charge of approximately million for a settlement with the new york city department of transportation related to an infrastructure group contract for construction support services gross revenue increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal acquisitions provided million of gross revenue growth in fiscal  while gross revenue from organic activities experienced a million decline in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to a decrease in exit strategy revenues as discussed in the nsr section below 
nsr decreased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal acquisitions provided million of nsr growth in fiscal  while nsr from organic activities experienced a million decline in fiscal compared to fiscal organic activities continued to be affected by challenging economic conditions  particularly for large capital projects which generally lag behind initial periods of economic upturns 
nsr from organic activities decreased during fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to the postponement of several large government related emissions tests and the softness in the infrastructure market which resulted in an estimated nsr decrease of approximately million in fiscal in addition  organic nsr decreased million which was primarily attributable to an exit strategy contract which went into insurance coverage during fiscal on exit strategy contracts we record proceeds from the restricted account held by the insurer as revenue up until the restricted account is depleted 
insurance proceeds received after the restricted account is depleted are recorded as insurance recoverables 
during  prior to the exit strategy contract reaching insurance coverage  proceeds were recorded as revenue whereas in fiscal insurance proceeds received were reported as an insurance recoverable 
the adverse impacts of the above items were partially offset by million of higher revenue attributable to increased demand from our energy clients 
interest income from contractual arrangements increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal primarily due to higher one year constant maturity t bill rates 
insurance recoverables increased million  to million in fiscal due to the exit strategy contract where costs were incurred that were covered by insurance 
cost of services cos increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal acquisitions accounted for approximately million  or  of the increase in fiscal compared to last year while organic cost of services increased million or 
specifically  organic cos increased due to the approximately million of cost increases at two of our operations that principally service the infrastructure market 
the increased costs were primarily attributable to new office openings  increases in staff headcount and higher than expected marketing costs 
these additional costs were not supported by a corresponding increase in nsr 
as a result a million restructuring charge was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal to reduce and rebalance the workforce within these offices 
the restructuring is expected to reduce operating costs and expenses by approximately million annually 
organic cos also increased by million to support growing customer demand from our energy clients 
to serve this increase in demand  we increased our billable headcount 
in addition  organic cos in fiscal includes the following charges approximately million higher than anticipated allowance for doubtful accounts charges  approximately million of contract loss reserves  a million write off related to certain distributed generation assets whose value has declined primarily due to high natural gas costs  and a million settlement with the new york city department of transportation related to a contract for construction support services 
consolidated g a expenses increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal in fiscal  we incurred approximately million of external costs in connection with our efforts to become compliant with the requirements of section sox 
the remainder of the increase was primarily related to a million increase in litigation related costs and other internal costs related to sox 
consolidated depreciation and amortization increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in depreciation and amortization expense in fiscal is primarily due to the amortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions completed in the current year and the additional depreciation expense resulting from capital expenditures completed in fiscal and as a result of the above factors  income loss from operations decreased by million  or  to a million loss in fiscal from million in income in fiscal acquisitions provided million of income from operations in fiscal income loss from operations  exclusive of acquisitions  decreased by million due to the reasons above 
equity in earnings from unconsolidated affiliates  net of taxes increased million  or  to million earnings in fiscal from in fiscal in october  we exercised an option to redeem our investment in an environmental liability management company formed by a customer 
as a result  we received million and recognized a gain of million net of initial investment during the three months ended march  as equity in losses from unconsolidated affiliates 
the amount earned was related to cost savings generated on an environmental remediation program managed by us 
in fiscal  interest expense increased million  or  to million from million in fiscal the increase resulted primarily from higher borrowings to finance acquisitions and higher interest rates throughout the year 
the provisions benefit for federal and state income taxes reflect effective rates of in fiscal and in fiscal this decrease was primarily due to losses incurred by certain entities for which no associated state tax benefit has been derived as well as minority interest losses on which no tax benefit is available in fiscal we believe that there will be sufficient taxable income in future periods to enable utilization of available deferred income tax benefits 
ceg years ended june  change gross revenue less subcontractor costs and other direct reimbursable charges net service revenue cost of services goodwill and intangible asset write offs loss from operations equity in earnings losses from unconsolidated affiliates as discussed in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements  pursuant to the requirements of fin r  we consolidated the financial statements of co energy in the fourth quarter of fiscal and all of fiscal as it was determined that we are the primary beneficiary of co energy a variable interest entity or vie 
as such  the fiscal financial data presented above only reflects the operations of ceg for the fourth quarter of fiscal gross revenue increased million  or  in fiscal  compared to fiscal the increase is primarily the result of fiscal including a full year of ceg operations compared to fiscal only including the fourth quarter of ceg operations 
nsr decreased million  or  in fiscal  compared to fiscal the decrease is primarily the result of cost over runs on certain fixed fee projects that resulted in the reversal of revenue under the percentage of completion method of accounting 
cost of services increased million  or  in fiscal  compared to fiscal the increase is the result of fiscal including a full year of ceg operations compared to fiscal only including the fourth quarter of ceg operations 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  it became clear that a technical error which occurred during the installation phase of a long term contract would result in a significant reduction of total expected revenue under this contract 
the reduction of revenue put the seventeen year contract into a forward loss position 
the impact of the loss contract triggered an impairment evaluation of the goodwill within the ceg reporting unit

therefore  in june  we recorded an impairment charge of million to write off the goodwill 
in addition  we recorded a million impairment charge to write off the intangible assets of ceg 
loss from operations increased million  or  in fiscal  compared to fiscal  for the reasons described above 
equity in earnings losses from unconsolidated affiliates was in fiscal as ceg was consolidated as a vie 
the equity loss in fiscal was for the first three fiscal quarters of the year prior to the consolidation of ceg 
compared to engineering consulting years ended june  change gross revenue less subcontractor costs and other direct reimbursable charges net service revenue cost of services income from operations equity in earnings losses from unconsolidated affiliates the following table presents the percentage relationship of certain items to nsr years ended june  net service revenue cost of services income from operations gross revenue increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal organic activities existing business provided million or of gross revenue growth in fiscal with acquisitions providing the remaining million or of the gross revenue growth 
the increase from organic activities relates principally to significant subcontractor efforts incurred on certain exit strategy and other construction contracts during fiscal nsr increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal acquisitions provided million or of nsr growth in fiscal  with organic activities providing the remaining million or of the nsr growth 
organic activities continued to be affected by challenging economic conditions  particularly for large capital projects which generally lag behind initial periods of economic upturns  although in the fourth quarter organic activities provided approximately of the nsr growth 
nsr from acquired companies is considered part of acquisition growth during the twelve months following the date acquired 
interest income from contractual arrangements decreased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal primarily related to lower average restricted investment balances throughout fiscal insurance recoverables decreased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due to lower recoverables from exit strategy contracts 
cost of services increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was primarily from the increase in nsr 
as a percentage of nsr  cost of services decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the improvement over the prior year resulted from cost reductions made to align capacity with the pace of activity 
consolidated g a expenses increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal these increases were primarily due to additional costs required to support our growth  costs associated with our initial efforts to become compliant with the requirements of sox and an additional million of costs necessary to complete our fiscal audit 
the additional audit costs were recorded in the first quarter of fiscal consolidated depreciation and amortization increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to the additional depreciation expense related to capital expenditures completed in fiscal and  as well as the additional depreciation expense associated with acquisitions completed in fiscal as a result of the above factors  income from operations increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal for fiscal  acquisitions provided million of the growth in operating income  while organic activities reduced income from operations by million 
equity in losses from unconsolidated affiliates  net of taxes increased million  or  to in fiscal from million in losses in fiscal interest expense increased by approximately in fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily due to higher average borrowings outstanding against our revolving credit facility to finance acquisition payments 
our percentage of debt to capitalization ratio was reduced by approximately to in fiscal the provisions for federal and state income taxes reflect effective rates of in fiscal and in fiscal this increase was primarily due to the distribution of revenue in states with higher state income taxes 
ceg years ended june  change gross revenue less subcontractor costs and other direct reimbursable charges net service revenue cost of services loss from operations equity in earnings losses from unconsolidated affiliates as discussed in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements  pursuant to the requirements of fin r  we consolidated the financial statements of co energy as of april   and all of fiscal as it was determined that we are the primary beneficiary of co energy a variable interest entity or vie 
as such  the financial data presented above only reflects the operations of ceg for the fourth quarter of fiscal prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal  we used the equity method of accounting for its investment in ceg 
impact of inflation our operations have not been materially affected by inflation or changing prices because most contracts of a longer term are subject to adjustment or have been priced to cover anticipated increases in labor and other costs and the remaining contracts are short term in nature 
liquidity and capital resources we primarily rely on cash from operations and financing activities  including borrowings under our revolving credit facility  to fund operations 
our liquidity is assessed in terms of our overall ability to generate cash to fund our operating and investing activities and to reduce debt 
cash flows provided by operating activities were million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal sources of cash generated from operating activities during fiscal totaled million and consisted primarily of million from increases in accounts payable primarily related to higher subcontractor costs in q fiscal compared to q fiscal  million from increases in deferred revenues related to the award of new exit strategy contracts in fiscal  the million increase in environmental remediation liabilities  million from an increase in other accrued liabilities primarily due to increased sox and audit costs in fiscal and an an increase in contract loss reserves  the million increase in restricted investments primarily related to the award of new exit strategy contracts in fiscal  and  non cash expenses of million million for depreciation and amortization  million for the provision for doubtful accounts and million for changes in deferred taxes and other non cash items 
the cash provided was partially offset by the million increase in accounts receivable that is explained below  the million increase in long term prepaid insurance related to the award of new exit strategy contracts in fiscal  and the million increase in insurance recoverable primarily related to one exit strategy project 
accounts receivable include both billed receivables associated with invoices submitted for work previously completed and unbilled receivables work in progress 
the unbilled receivables are primarily related to work performed in the last few months of the fiscal year 
the magnitude of accounts receivable for a professional services company is typically evaluated as days sales outstanding dso  which is calculated by dividing both current and long term receivables by the most recent six month average of daily gross revenue after adjusting for acquisitions 
dso  which measures the collections turnover of both billed and unbilled receivables  has increased to at june  from at last year end 
more recently  we have been successful in significantly reducing dso 
our goal is to reduce dso to less than days 
under exit strategy contracts  the majority of the contract price is deposited into a restricted account with an insurer 
these proceeds  less any insurance premiums for a policy to cover potential cost overruns and other factors  are held by the insurer and used to pay us as work is performed 
the arrangement with the insurer provides for deposited funds to earn interest at the one year constant maturity t bill rate 
as such  there is a risk that the deposited funds will not grow at the rate anticipated when the contract was executed resulting in a lower amount of funds to perform the contractual requirements 
however  this risk is mitigated by a finite risk cost cap insurance policy which provides coverage for cost increases from unknown or changed conditions up to a specified maximum amount significantly in excess of the estimated cost of remediation 
investing activities used cash of approximately million in fiscal compared to million last year 
the investments in fiscal consisted of million for acquisitions approximately million for current year acquisitions and approximately million for additional purchase price payments related to acquisitions completed in prior years  million for capital expenditures for additional information technology and other equipment to support business growth  an additional million for investments in unconsolidated affiliates  and million of restricted investments related to exit strategy projects 
during fiscal  financing activities provided cash of million  consisting of million of net borrowings from our credit facility to support investing activities and million from the exercise of stock options and warrants  partially offset by million to repay long term debt 
at june   we had borrowings outstanding pursuant to our revolving credit facility of million at an average interest rate of  compared to million of borrowings outstanding at an average interest rate of at june  events of default have occurred under the credit agreement as a result of our failure to timely deliver audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended june  and our violation of the coverage and leverage ratios due to lower than expected earnings 
as a result  on november   january   february  and march  we entered into forbearance agreements and global amendments to our credit agreement with our lenders that extend through july  under the terms of these agreements  the lenders agreed to continue to make loans under the credit agreement and forbear in the exercise of their rights and remedies under the credit agreement 
the maximum amount available under the credit agreement was reduced to million following our million equity financing which closed in march and gradually reduces to million by june  however  the forbearance agreement contains a covenant that requires us to maintain a minimum availability of million increasing to million by virtue of cash received in the pacland settlement  effectively reducing the maximum amount available under the credit agreement 
we are also required to pay an additional interest on outstanding loans under the credit agreement and to provide the lenders or their consultants full access to our financial records and provide the lenders with certain financial and other deliverables 
we also agreed that we will not  without the consent of the lenders  incur additional indebtedness  pledge any of our assets  pay any cash dividends or make any distributions to our shareholders  except with respect to the payments of dividends or the redemption of preferred stock with common stock  become a party to a merger  consolidation  or acquisition or sell or otherwise dispose of our assets 
in addition  borrowings under the credit agreement are collateralized by all of our assets 
in may and june  we received several term sheets from financial institutions 
the term sheets all provided for either a revolving line of credit secured by accounts receivable and tangible and intangible assets  or a revolving line of credit and subordinated debt where the revolving line of credit would be secured by a first lien on accounts receivable and tangible and intangible assets and the subordinated debt would be secured by a second lien on those same assets 
we are now pursuing the refinancing of the outstanding debt with two institutions that have both indicated their ability to complete the refinancing by the july  termination date of the forbearance agreement 
both institutions are in the process of finalizing their due diligence 
we believe that we will refinance the outstanding debt with one of the financial institutions  or  in the event that both institutions withdraw from the refinancing  we would then go forward in refinancing the outstanding debt with another financial institution for which we have received a term sheet 
in addition  we have been discussing with potential investors the raising of additional capital through the issuance of common stock 
we expect that the cash generated from operations  the cash on hand at june   available borrowings under the revolving credit facility which expires on july   proceeds from asset sales  and the cash generated from the recent completion of a million private placement discussed in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital requirements 
we are currently in the process of replacing our existing line of credit with a facility from another lender 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth  as of june   certain information concerning our obligations to make future principal and interest payments variable interest components used interest rates of between for estimating future interest payment obligations under contracts  such as debt and lease agreements dollars in thousands 
the rates used to project the future interest payments on our subordinated notes were between and 
the rate used to project the future interest payments on our long term debt was and included the additional interest discussed in the liquidity and capital resources section above payments due by period contractual obligations total year years years beyond long term debt subordinated notes operating leases capitalized lease obligations total contractual obligations we have entered into several long term contracts pursuant to our exit strategy program under which we are obligated to complete the remediation of environmental conditions at sites 
see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the obligations pursuant to exit strategy contracts 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements other than operating leases for most of our office facilities and certain equipment 
rental expense for operating leases was approximately million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal minimum operating lease obligations payable in future years ie  primarily base rent are presented above in contractual obligations 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb directed the staff to issue the proposed fsp eitf issue a as final and it will be retitled fsp fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  fsp fas 
it replaces existing guidance and clarifies that an impairment should be recognized as a loss at a date no later than the impairment is deemed other than temporary  even if the decision to sell has not been made 
fsp fas is effective for other than temporary impairment analysis conducted in periods beginning after september  we believe that our current policy on other than temporary impairments complies with fsp fas accordingly  we do not expect the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our financial results 
in june  the fasb issued fsp no 
fas  issuer s accounting under fasb statement no

this fsp clarifies that freestanding warrants and other similar instruments on shares that are redeemable either puttable or mandatorily redeemable should be accounted for as liabilities under fasb statement no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas  regardless of the timing of the redemption feature or price even though the underlying shares may be classified as equity 
this fsp is effective for us beginning july  we do not expect the adoption of this fsp will have a material impact on our financial results 
in june  the eitf issued eitf issue no 
 determining the amortization period for leasehold improvements purchased after lease inception or acquired in a business combination eitf 
eitf states that leasehold improvements that are placed in service significantly after the beginning of the lease term should be amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the assets or a term that includes required lease periods and renewals that are deemed to be reasonably assured at the date the leasehold improvements are purchased 
the pronouncement is effective for us beginning after july  we do not expect the adoption of this issue will have a material impact on our financial results 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  a replacement of principles board apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas requires  among other things  retrospective application  unless impracticable  to prior period financial statements for voluntary changes in accounting principles and changes required by an accounting pronouncement in the unusual circumstances in which the pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions 
sfas also requires that a change in depreciation  amortization  or depletion method for long lived  nonfinancial assets should be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle 
the guidance for reporting the correction of an error in previously issued financial statements and the change of an accounting estimate will not change from apb opinion no 
sfas is effective for us beginning july  we do not expect the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our financial results 
in march  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations fin 
the interpretation clarifies the requirement to record abandonment liabilities stemming from legal obligations when the retirement depends on a conditional future event 
fin requires that the uncertainty about the timing or method of settlement of a conditional retirement obligation be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists 
fin is effective for us beginning july  we do not expect the adoption of this interpretation will have a material impact on our financial results 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r  which is a revision of sfas no 
 requires us to expense the value of stock option awards 
in march  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payment  sab regarding the staff s interpretation of sfas r 
we will follow the guidance prescribed in sab in connection with the adoption of sfas r  which is effective for us beginning july  sfas r must be applied to new awards and previously granted awards that are not fully vested on the effective date 
if we adopted sfas r in prior years  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note of this report 
we will use the modified prospective method for adoption of sfas r  and expect that the related compensation cost to be recognized during fiscal will range from million to million before income taxes 
sfas r also requires that the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets sfas  which eliminates the exception from fair value measurement for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception from fair value measurement for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
sfas is required to be adopted in fiscal periods beginning after june  we do not expect the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our financial results 
in december  the fasb issued staff position no 
fsp  application of fasb statement  sfas  accounting for income taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of 
fsp clarifies guidance that applies to the new deduction for qualified domestic production activities 
when fully phased in  the deduction will be up to of the lesser of qualified production activities income or taxable income 
fsp clarifies that the deduction should be accounted for as a special deduction under sfas and will reduce tax expense in the period or periods that the amounts are deductible on the tax return 
fsp is effective for us beginning july  we do not expect the adoption of this fsp will have a material impact on our financial results 
in april  the fasb issued staff position no 
 disclosure requirements under fasb  disclosure of information about capital structure  and relating to contingently convertible securities 
the fasb staff confirmed through this fsp that the disclosure requirements of fasb apply to all contingently convertible financial instruments  including those containing contingent conversion requirements that have not been met and are not otherwise required to be included in the computation of diluted earnings per share 
we have included the required disclosures in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item of this report 
in may  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  which establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances  and is effective for instruments entered into or modified after may  and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  the provisions regarding guidance for accounting for mandatorily redeemable non controlling interests in subsidiaries that would not be liabilities under sfas have been deferred for an indefinite period 
the adoption of the currently effective provisions of this standard did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
we have specifically reviewed whether our redeemable preferred stock is within the scope of this standard  and  due to the redemption value being subject to a floor share price  the monetary amount at inception was not deemed to be fixed or determinable 
as a result  our redeemable preferred stock does not fall within the scope of this standard 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we currently do not utilize derivative financial instruments that expose us to significant market risk 
we are exposed to interest rate risk under our credit agreement 
our credit facility provided for borrowings at a base rate the greater of the federal funds rate plus per annum or the bank s reference rate plus a margin which ranges from to per annum 
events of default have occurred under the credit agreement  among other things  as a result of our failure to deliver timely audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended june  and our violation of the coverage and leverage ratios due to lower than expected earnings 
as a result  on november   january  and february   we entered into forbearance agreements and global amendments to our credit agreement with our lenders that extend through july  under the terms of these agreements  the lenders agreed to continue to make loans under the credit agreement and forbear in the exercise of their rights and remedies under the credit agreement 
the maximum amount available under the credit agreement was reduced to million following our million equity financing which closed in march and gradually reduces further to million by june  however  the forbearance agreement contains a covenant that requires us to maintain a minimum availability of million increasing to million by virtue of the cash received in the pacland settlement  effectively reducing the maximum amount available under the credit agreement 
we are also required to pay an additional interest on outstanding loans under the credit agreement and to provide the lenders or their consultants full access to our financial records and provide the lenders with certain financial and other deliverables 
borrowings at the base rate have no designated term and may be repaid without penalty any time prior to the facility s maturity date 
under its original term  the facility matured on march  or earlier at our discretion  upon payment in full of loans and other obligations
