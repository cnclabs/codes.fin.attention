item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a clinical laboratory located in northeastern new jersey 
our regional footprint lies within the new york city metropolitan area and the surrounding areas of new jersey and southern new york state as well eastern pennsylvania and some areas of western connecticut  under certain circumstances  we provide services further into new york state  pennsylvania  delaware and maryland 
as a regional provider  we are a full service laboratory that primarily services physician office practices  our drivers pick up samples and deliver reports and supplies  we provide sophisticated technical support  phlebotomy services or patient service centers where appropriate  and electronic communication services in many cases 
we have also developed a national reputation for our expertise in certain focused areas of clinical testing 
genpath  our cancer and oncology laboratory  is one of the premier hematopathology laboratories in the country 
physicians outside of our regional footprint send samples to our laboratory in order to take advantage of the expertise that we are able to provide in blood based cancer pathology and associated diagnostics 
our correctional healthcare services are used throughout the country at prisons and jails 
the focused markets we serve on a national basis outside of our regional footprint do not require many of the logistical and other ancillary support services required within the region 
even within our regional footprint  we provide the same services that we provide on a national basis as well as some regional focused diagnostic services  such as histology and pathology support services  substance abuse testing  fertility testing  hemostasis testing  women s health testing  and molecular diagnostics that are unavailable from many of the smaller regional competitors  testing for some of these areas may be provided outside of physician offices 
over the last few years  there have been fundamental changes in the laboratory services industry 
in the s  the industry was negatively impacted by the growth of managed care  increased government regulation  and investigations into fraud and abuse 
these factors led to revenue and profit declines and industry consolidations  especially among commercial laboratories 
there are currently only four publicly traded laboratories  and one of those is being acquired by a private corporation and will be leaving the public markets in the near future 
while that will leave the two national mega laboratories and bioreference laboratories as the only remaining publicly traded commercial laboratories  there are numerous hospital outreach programs and smaller reference laboratories that compete for the commercial clinical laboratory business scattered throughout the country 
clinical laboratories have had to improve efficiency  leverage economies of scale  comply with government regulations and other laws and develop more profitable approaches to pricing 
moreover  there has been a proliferation of technology advancements in clinical diagnostics over the last decade that has created significant opportunities for new testing and growth 
as a full service clinical laboratory  we are constantly looking for new technologies and new methodologies that will help us to grow 
since the turn of the century  our size alone has made us attractive to companies that are driving the advances in technology 
we represent a significant opportunity for these companies to market their products in one of the major population centers of the world the new york metropolitan area 
we have had several successful strategic relationships with such technology opportunities 
in addition to new technology opportunities  we have an extremely seasoned and talented management staff that has been able to identify emerging laboratory markets that are under served or under utilized 
we are currently developing programs for histology and women s health to go along with our existing hemostasis  hematopathology and correctional healthcare initiatives which have already been established and in which we have been increasing our market share for the past several years 
we will continue to vigilantly seek focused diagnostic marketing opportunities where we can provide information  technology  service or support that expand and grow our clinical laboratory 
while we recognize that we are a clinical laboratory that processes samples  we also understand that we are an information company that needs to effectively communicate the results of our efforts back to healthcare providers 
laboratory results play a major role in the implementation of physician healthcare 
laboratory results are used to diagnose  monitor and classify health concerns 
in many cases  laboratory results represent the confirming data in diagnosing complicated health issues 
since laboratory results play such an important role in routine physician care  we have developed informatics solutions that leverage our role in healthcare 
we needed to build a web based solution to quickly  accurately  conveniently and competitively collect ordering information and deliver results  so we built an internal solution that we call careevolve 
that solution has been so essential to our own operations that we license the technology to other laboratories throughout the country so they may more effectively compete against the national laboratories 
these other laboratories licensing our technology are not out competitors since they are outside our regional footprint 
in  we entered into a strategic marketing agreement with roche diagnostics to co market careevolve to laboratories throughout the country 
thanks to the relationship with roche  careevolve received funding during its early years and built a solid infrastructure for growth and marketing 
however  over the subsequent years  it became apparent that the relationship had served its purpose and it was terminated by mutual consent 
we own all right  title and interest to careevolve and the informatics solution that has been built 
we use it for our own customers and to help other smaller labs effectively compete against our common competition 
we have also created our psimedica business unit which has developed a clinical knowledge management ckm system that takes data from enrollment  claims  pharmacy  laboratory results and any other available electronic source to provide both administrative and clinical analysis of a population 
the system uses proprietary algorithms to cleanse and configure the data and transfer the resulting information into a healthcare data repository 
using advanced cube technology methodologies  the data can be analyzed from a myriad of views and from highly granular transactional detail to global trended overview 
events such as the katrina disaster in louisiana this past summer and general pressures from the government have made development of an electronic medical record system and pay for performance reimbursement priority goals in the healthcare industry 
a large portion of an individual s medical record consists of laboratory data and a key performance indicator in any pay for performance initiative is laboratory result data 
our ckm system is a mature  full functioning solution that will allow us to play a role in these important national initiatives 
to date  neither our psimedica business unit nor careevolve has produced significant revenues 
results of operations in thousands  except per patient data fiscal year compared to net revenues net revenues for the year ended october  were  as compared to  for the year ended october   this represents a increase in net revenues 
this increase is due to a increase in patients serviced and a increase in net revenue per patient 
our laboratory operations had net revenues of  in fiscal the number of patients serviced during the year ended october  was  which was greater when compared to the prior fiscal year 
net revenue per patient for the year ended october  was compared to net revenue per patient for the year ended october  of  an increase of or as a result of increases in esoteric testing 
cost of services cost of services for the year ended october  was  as compared to  for the year ended october   an increase of 
employee related expenses increased by  and is attributable to the hiring of additional technical and professional personnel dedicated to the expansion of the company s cancer and esoteric testing business

total depreciation and amortization increased from  for the period ended october  to  for the period ended october  an increase of  or 
gross profit gross profit on net revenues increased to  for the year ended october  from  for the year ended october   an increase of   primarily attributable to the increase in net revenues 
gross profit margins decreased to from  primarily due to the increase in direct operating expenses 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses for the year ended october  were  as compared to  for the year ended october   an increase of  or 
this is greater than the increase in net revenues and is attributable to an increase in bad debt expense to just over of net revenues as compared to just under for the twelve month period ended october  management believes that this expense category may remain at this level in the immediate future 
marketing expenses as a percent of net revenues remained relatively constant over the two year period at and management believes that it may remain at this level in the future 
interest expense interest expense increased from during the year ended october  to  during the year ended october   an increase of this increase is due to an increase in the variable interest rates associated with and the increased utilization of our line of credit 
management believes that this trend may continue in the future due to the continued use of our revolving line of credit to fund our growth and the increase in interest rates that may continue to occur during fiscal year net income we realized net income of  for the twelve month period ended october  as compared to  for the twelve month period ended october   a decrease of 
at the beginning of calendar year  cms announced significant cuts to medicare reimbursement rates for flow cytometry testing 
these cuts adversely affected both our net revenues and operating income in fiscal we do not anticipate any restoration of the former reimbursement rates in fiscal pre tax income for the period ended october  was  as compared to  for the period ended october   a decrease of and was caused primarily by an increase in expenses in relation to an increase in net revenues 
the provision for income taxes increased from  for the period ended october   to  for the current twelve month period 
fiscal year compared to net revenues net revenues for the year ended october  were  as compared to  for the year ended october   this represents a increase in net revenues 
this increase is due to a increase in patients serviced and a increase in net revenue per patient

this increase is related to the increase in net revenues of 
gross profit gross profit on net revenues increased to  for the year ended october  from  for the year ended october   an increase of   primarily attributable to the increase in net revenues and the decrease in direct costs relative to the increase in net revenues 
gross profit margins in the laboratory increased to from  primarily due to the increase in net revenues and efficiencies in direct operating expenses 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses for the year ended october  were  as compared to  for the year ended october   an increase of  or 
this is greater than the increase in net revenues and is attributable to several factors 
bad debt expense increased to of net revenues as compared to for the twelve month period ended october  this increase in bad debt is partly attributable to an increase in our third party billing and our acquisition of new payors in new geographical regions resulting from the expansion of our oncology and esoteric testing services 
marketing expenses as a percent of net revenues increased from in fiscal year to in fiscal year  a result of our continued emphasis on sales and marketing in the area of oncology and esoteric testing 
in addition  we took a one time charge against earnings of approximately  that came about because of changes in an addendum we executed to our strategic marketing alliance with roche diagnostic corporation 
interest expense interest expense decreased from during the year ended october  to during the year ended october   a decrease of this decrease is due to a decline in the variable interest rates associated with our line of credit 
management believes that this trend may not continue in the future due to the continued use of our revolving line of credit to fund our expansion and growth and the increase in interest rates that may continue to occur during fiscal year net income we realized net income of  for the twelve month period ended october  as compared to  for the twelve month period ended october   an increase of 
pre tax income for the period ended october  was  as compared to  for the period ended october   an increase of  and was caused primarily by a decrease in expenses in relation to an increase in net revenues 
the provision for income taxes increased from  for the period ended october   to  for the current twelve month period 
this increase was anticipated due to the full utilization of federal and state net operating loss carry forwards during the third quarter of fiscal however  it was mitigated by other tax considerations 
liquidity and capital resources in thousands for the fiscal year ended october  our working capital at october  was approximately  as compared to approximately  at october   an increase of  our cash position decreased by approximately  during the current period 
we increased our short term borrowing by approximately and repaid approximately  in existing debt 
we had current liabilities of approximately  at october  we generated approximately  in cash from operations  a decrease of approximately  as compared to the year ended october  at the end of the third quarter of the current fiscal year  our short term debt was approximately  we utilized approximately  in cash and allowed our accounts payable to increase approximately  during the fourth quarter to decrease our short term debt to  at october  in addition  we utilized approximately  of cash for the pathco acquisition 
accounts receivable  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  totaled approximately  at october   an increase of approximately  from october   or 
this increase was primarily attributable to increased revenue 
cash collected over the twelve month period ended october  increased over the prior twelve month period 
net service revenues on the statements of operations are as follows years ended october gross revenues contr 
adjustments and discounts net revenues percent of contractual adjustments and discounts to gross revenues the table above illustrates the relationship between contractual adjustments and gross revenues for the years  and from to  contractual allowances as a percentage of gross revenues increased approximately basis points  consistent with a relatively stable reimbursement environment 
between and  contractual allowances increased approximately basis points 
the most significant factor in this increase was the decrease in reimbursement rates for flow cytometry 
this decrease was fully discussed upon release of our fiscal results 
the company s growth in flow cytometry testing volume contributed significantly to the increase in contractual allowances for fiscal year credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is generally diversified due to the large number of patients comprising our client base 
we have significant receivable balances with government payors and various insurance carriers 
generally  we do not require collateral or other security to support customer receivables 
however  we continually monitor and evaluate our client acceptance and collection procedures to minimize potential credit risks associated with our accounts receivable and establish an allowance for uncollectible accounts 
as a consequence  we believe that our accounts receivable credit risk exposure beyond such allowance is not material to the financial statements 
a number of proposals for legislation continue to be under discussion which could substantially reduce medicare and medicaid reimbursements to clinical laboratories 
depending upon the nature of regulatory action  and the content of legislation  we could experience a significant decrease in revenues from medicare and medicaid  which could have a material adverse effect on us 
we are unable to predict  however  the extent to which such actions will be taken

ins total billing for laboratory services is complicated and we must bill various payors  such as the individual  the insurance company  the government federal or state  the private company or the health clinic 
other factors that may complicate billing include differences between fee schedules and reimbursement rates 
incomplete or inaccurate billing information as provided by the doctor 
disparity in coverage and information requirements 
disputes with payors 
internal and external compliance policies and procedures 
significant costs are incurred as a result of our participation in government programs since billing and reimbursement for laboratory tests are subject to complex regulations 
we perform the requested tests and report the results whether the information is correct or not or even missing 
this adds to the complexity and slows the collection process and increases the aging of our accounts receivable a r

during april of  cms along with other commercial insurers implemented certain changes as required by hipaa that caused this increase in our dso s 
these changes are exaggerated by our primary marketplace  the physician office marketplace

in october  the company entered into an amended revolving note payable loan agreement with a bank 
the maximum amount of the credit line available to the company is the lesser of i  or ii of the company s qualified accounts receivable 
as defined in the agreement 
the amended loan agreement provides for an acquisition subline of up to  which can be repaid in equal monthly installments 
the amendment to the loan and security agreement provides for interest on advances to be subject to the bank s prime rate or eurodollar rate of interest plus  in certain instances  an additional interest percentage 
the additional interest percentage charges on eurodollar borrowings range from to and are determined based upon certain financial ratios achieved by the company 
at october   the company had elected to have  of the total advances outstanding converted into a eurodollar rate loan with a variable interest rate of at october  the remaining outstanding advances during that period were subject to the bank s prime rate of interest

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods 
accounting for goodwill we evaluate the recoverability and measure the possible impairment of its goodwill under sfas  the impairment test is a two step process that begins with the estimation of the fair value of the reporting unit 
the first step screens for potential impairment and the second step measures the amount of the impairment  if any 
management s estimate of fair value considers publicly available information regarding our market capitalization as well as i publicly available information regarding comparable publicly traded companies in the clinical laboratory testing industry  ii the financial projections and future prospects of our business  including its growth opportunities and likely operational improvements  and iii comparable sales prices  if available 
as part of the first step to assess potential impairment  management compares the estimate of its fair value to its book value on a consolidated net assets 
if the book value of the consolidated net assets is greater than the estimate of fair value  we then proceed to the second step to measure the impairment  if any 
the second step compares the implied fair value of goodwill with its carrying value the implied fair value is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the goodwill is greater than its implied fair value  an impairment loss will be recognized in that period 
accounting for intangible and other long lived assets we evaluate the possible impairment of our long lived assets  including intangible assets 
we review the recoverability of our long lived assets when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
evaluation of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the asset from the expected future pretax cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges of the related operations 
if the expected undiscounted pretax cash flows are less than the carrying amount of such asset  an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the estimated fair value and carrying amount of the asset 
accounting for revenue service revenues are principally generated from clinical laboratory testing services such as routine and esoteric testing see pages and 
net service revenues are recognized at the time the testing services are performed and are reported at the estimated net realizable amounts from patients  third party payors and others for services rendered including prospectively determined adjustments under reimbursement agreements with third party payors 
these adjustments are accrued on an estimated basis in the period the related services are rendered and adjusted in future periods as final settlements are determined 
the company has a subsidiary that provides non clinical laboratory services 
revenues generated from these services are not material for each of the years presented 
accounting for contractual credits and doubtful accounts an allowance for contractual credits is determined based upon a review of the reimbursement policies and subsequent collections for the different types of payors such as the decrease in flow cytometry reimbursement rates from cms starting january  
agings of accounts receivable are monitored by billing personnel and follow up activities are conducted as necessary 
bad debt expense is recorded within selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales considered necessary to maintain the allowance for doubtful accounts at an appropriate level  based on our experience with our accounts receivable 
we write off accounts against the allowance for doubtful accounts when they are deemed to be uncollectible 
for client billing  accounts are written off when all reasonable collection efforts prove to be unsuccessful 
patient accounts are written off after the normal dunning cycle has occurred and the account has been transferred to a third party collection agency 
third party accounts are written off when they exceed the payer s timely filing limits 
accounting for employment benefit plan we sponsor the bio reference laboratories  inc k profit sharing plan 
the plan 
our employees become eligible for participation after attaining the age of eighteen and completing one year of service 
participants may elect to contribute up to ten percent of their compensation  as defined in the plan adoption agreement  to a maximum allowed by the internal revenue service 
we may choose to make a matching contribution to the plan for each participant who has elected to make tax deferred contributions for the plan year  at a percentage determined each year by the company 
for the plan years beginning january  we elected to make a matching contribution of of salary not to exceed which amounted to  for the plan years beginning january  and  we elected to make a matching contribution of of salary not to exceed per participant which amounted to  and  respectively which were charged to operations 
our contribution will be fully vested after the third year of service 
accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes utilizing the asset and liability method 
under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and for tax loss carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
future tax benefits  such as net operating loss carryforwards  are recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not 
forward looking statements this annual report on form k contains historical information as well as forward looking statements 
statements looking forward in time are included in this annual report pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results in future periods to be materially different from any future performance suggested herein 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
while many aspects of our business are subject to complex federal  state and local regulations  the accounting for our business is generally straightforward 
our revenues are primarily comprised of a high volume of relatively low dollar transactions  and about of all our costs consist of employee compensation and benefits 
revenues are recognized at the time the services are performed and are reported at the estimated net realizable amounts from patients  third party payors and others for services rendered including prospectively determined adjustments under reimbursement agreements with third party payors 
these adjustments are accrued on an estimated basis in the period the services are rendered and adjusted in future periods as final settlements are determined 
these estimates are reviewed and adjusted  if warranted  by senior management on a monthly basis 
we believe that our estimates and assumptions are correct  however  several factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those currently anticipated due to a number of factors in addition to those discussed under cautionary statements as well as elsewhere herein including our failure to integrate newly acquired businesses if any and the cost related to such integration 
our failure to obtain and retain new customers and alliance partners  or a reduction in tests ordered or specimens submitted by existing customers 
adverse results from investigations of clinical laboratories by the government  which may include significant monetary damages and or exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs 
loss or suspension of a license or imposition of a fine or penalties under  or future changes in  the law or regulations of clia  or those of medicare  medicaid or other federal  state or local agencies 
changes in federal  state  local and third party payor regulations or policies or in the interpretation of current regulations affecting governmental and third party reimbursement for clinical laboratory testing such as the decrease in medicare reimbursement for flow cytometry testing described above under cautionary statements 
failure to comply with the federal occupational safety and health administration requirements and the recently passed needlestick safety and prevention act 
failure to comply with hipaa  which could result in significant fines as well as substantial criminal penalties 
changes in payor mix 
failure to maintain our days sales outstanding levels 
increased competition  including price competition 
our ability to attract and retain experienced and qualified personnel 
adverse litigation results 
liabilities that result from our inability to comply with new corporate governance requirements 
failure to comply with the sarbanes oxley act of item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not invest in or trade market risk sensitive instruments 
we also do not have any foreign operations or foreign sales so that our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk is non existent 
we do have exposure to both rising and falling interest rates 
at october   advances of approximately under our loan agreement with pnc bank were subject to interest charges at the bank s then prime rate of 
in addition  we elected to have the remaining  of advances outstanding at said date converted into a eurodollar rate loan with a variable interest rate of 
we estimate that our monthly cash interest expense at october  was approximately thousand and that a one percentage point increase or decrease in short term rates would increase or decrease our monthly interest expense by approximately thousand
