management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued overall  we believe we grew net sales in at rates consistent with market growth rates and improved our overall profitability  when we exclude the items noted above 
overviews of each of our operating segments are noted below and reconciliations of segment results of operations to consolidated results of operations can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
insight north america reported year over year growth in net sales and earnings from operations of and  respectively 
we believe that our sales growth rate was near market growth rates  although we did not reach our internal targets of growing faster than the market 
we were encouraged by overall growth in our sales to large corporate enterprises  but demand in this sector began to slow near the end of we were also pleased to see that the second half of brought increased growth rates in sales to smb clients after several quarters of experiencing stalled growth 
during  we made changes in our insight north america executive management team  sales leadership  recruiting and training and have increased our marketing activities  all of which we believe will help position us to increase sales growth in the future 
we also recorded million million net of tax of severance charges related the elimination of certain sales  support and management functions  including the former president of insight worldwide 
these restructuring activities were designed to provide additional resources for our efforts to improve smb sales and to automate key business processes  flatten the organizational structure and increase the effectiveness of our management team 
these activities allow us to devote resources to hire additional account executives and sales managers  as well as to increase the effectiveness of our marketing  skills development  human resources and it systems  while continuing to focus on reducing selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales 
our financial goals for are focused on growing net sales faster than the market and improving our operating margin 
a discussion of our strategy to accomplish these goals can be found in item of this report 
net sales for insight uk for the year ended december  increased compared to the year ended december  in british pound sterling  we posted an increase in net sales of compared to the overall demand for it products and services in the united kingdom has been very slow 
however  we believe our sales growth was greater than the overall market growth rate in the united kingdom 
we believe our additions of experienced account executives and management focus on large corporate enterprises  as well as various internal initiatives in areas such as training and automation to drive sales growth across all client groups  contributed to our ability to grow sales amidst a challenging demand environment 
we also eliminated certain sales  support and management functions to streamline our operations and  as a result  recorded   net of tax of severance charges during at the end of  we moved our london facility to a new location and recorded restructuring charges of million million  net of tax representing the remaining lease obligations on the old lease and million  net of tax for duplicate rent expense for the new facility prior to the date we relocated 
we believe this new facility will provide a better layout for our business model with additional room for growth 
this facility is also in a more desirable location  which should improve teammate recruitment  retention  productivity and morale 
net sales for direct alliance for the year ended december  increased while earnings from operations decreased for the year ended december  the increase in net sales was due primarily to pass through product sales that are transacted as an accommodation to our clients at little or no gross margin 
the decline in earnings from operations was due primarily to the renegotiated fee structures as part of multi year contract renewals with some of direct alliance s largest clients 
during the year ended december   we also recorded million  net of tax of severance charges related to the departure of direct alliance s former president 
our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to assist in the understanding of our consolidated financial statements  the changes in certain key items in those consolidated financial statements from year to year  the primary factors that contributed to those changes  as well as how certain critical accounting estimates affect our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting estimates general our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
for a summary of significant accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  net sales and expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
members of our senior management have discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these 
table of contents insight enterprises  inc 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
actual results  however  may differ from estimates we have made 
we believe the following critical accounting estimates reflect our significant estimates and assumptions used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
accounting for stock based compensation we currently have various stock based compensation plans under which we have granted stock options  restricted stock and restricted stock units rsus to certain teammates and non employee directors 
to account for our fixed plan stock options  we currently apply the intrinsic value based method of accounting prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb no 
and related interpretations including fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation an interpretation of apb opinion no 
under this method  compensation expense is recorded on the date of grant only if the current market price of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price 
sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 
established accounting and disclosure requirements using a fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation plans 
as allowed by sfas no 
 we applied the intrinsic value based method of accounting described above and have adopted the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
we determine the estimated fair value of stock options on the date of the grant using the black scholes merton black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option pricing model requires us to apply highly subjective assumptions  including expected stock price volatility  expected life of the option and the risk free interest rate 
a change in one or more of the assumptions used in the black scholes option pricing model may result in a material change to the estimated fair value of the stock based compensation 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r  which replaces sfas no 
and apb no 
effective january   we have adopted sfas no 
r  as discussed under recently issued accounting standards in note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report  and we will be recording compensation expense for stock options in our financial statements 
we elected to not make any modifications to existing stock options outstanding prior to this date  such as accelerating the vesting of previously granted options as we did not believe it made business sense to do so 
we did  however  take the opportunity to reevaluate our equity compensation plans and we have elected to issue service based and performance based rsus instead of stock options in the number of rsus ultimately awarded under the performance based rsus will vary based on achievement of certain financial results 
we will record compensation expense each period based on our estimate of the most probable number of rsus that will be issued under the grants of performance based rsus 
additionally  the compensation expense will be reduced for our estimate of forfeitures 
our equity compensation expense  which includes expense attributable to rsu grants  as well as to vesting of stock options and restricted stock issued in prior years  is estimated to be between million and million 
the actual amount will likely vary  either higher or lower  based on achievement of financial results 
the expense range given assumes target financial results are reached 
allowances for doubtful accounts our accounts receivable balance was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the allowance is determined using estimated losses on accounts receivable based on historical write offs  evaluation of the aging of the receivables and the current economic environment 
should our clients circumstances change or actual collections of client and vendor receivables differ from our estimates  adjustments to the provision for losses on accounts receivable and the related allowances for doubtful accounts would be recorded 
see further information on our allowance for doubtful accounts in note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
write downs of inventories we evaluate inventories for excess  obsolescence or other factors that may render inventories unmarketable at normal margins 
write downs are recorded so that inventories reflect the approximate net realizable value and take into account our contractual provisions with our suppliers governing price protection  stock rotation and return privileges relating to obsolescence 
because of the large number of transactions and the complexity of managing the process around price protections and stock rotations  estimates are made regarding write downs of the carrying amount of inventories 
additionally  assumptions about future demand  market conditions and decisions by manufacturers to discontinue certain products or product lines can affect our decision to write down inventories 
if our assumptions about future demand change or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected  additional write downs of inventories may be required 
in any case  actual values could be different from those estimated

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued valuation of long lived assets including purchased intangible assets and goodwill we review property  plant and equipment  and purchased intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
our asset impairment review assesses the fair value of the assets based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset plus net proceeds expected from disposition of the asset if any and compares the fair value to the carrying value 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  an impairment loss is recognized for the difference 
this approach uses our estimates of future market growth  forecasted net sales and costs  expected periods the assets will be utilized  and appropriate discount rates 
annually  during the fourth quarter of each year  we assess whether goodwill is impaired 
upon determining the existence of goodwill impairment  we measure that impairment based on the amount by which the book value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by deducting the fair value of a reporting unit s identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole 
determining the fair value of reporting units  as well as identifiable assets and liabilities  uses our estimates of market capitalization allocation  future market growth  forecasted sales and costs and appropriate discount rates 
additional impairment assessments may be performed on an interim basis if we encounter events or changes in circumstances that would indicate that  more likely than not  the book value of goodwill has been impaired 
based on impairment tests performed  there was no impairment of goodwill for years ended december   or we identify potential impairment of goodwill through our strategic reviews of our reporting units and operations performed in conjunction with restructuring actions 
deterioration of our business in a geographic region or within a reporting unit in the future could lead to impairment adjustments as such issues are identified 
when impairment is identified  the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its estimated fair value 
severance and restructuring activities we have engaged  and may continue to engage  in severance and restructuring activities which require us to utilize significant estimates related primarily to employee termination benefits  estimated costs to terminate leases or remaining lease commitments on unused facilities  net of estimated subleases 
should the actual amounts differ from our estimates  adjustments to severance and restructuring expense in subsequent periods would be necessary 
we do not currently expect the remaining estimates to increase in the future  however  if we are successful in negotiating early terminations of these leases  the remaining estimates may decrease 
a detailed description of our severance  restructuring and acquisition integration activities and remaining accruals for these activities at december  can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
taxes on earnings our effective tax rate includes the effect of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no united states taxes have been provided because such earnings are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the united states 
earnings remittance amounts are planned based on the projected cash flow needs as well as the working capital and long term investment requirements of our foreign subsidiaries and our domestic operations 
material changes in our estimates of cash  working capital and long term investment requirements could affect our effective tax rate 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider past operating results  future market growth  forecasted earnings  historical and projected taxable income  the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate  prudent and feasible tax planning strategies and statutory tax law changes in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
if we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made 
likewise  if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized  the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed 
in  due to the historical and expected profitability of our uk operations  we reduced the valuation allowance and recorded a tax benefit of million 
additional information about the valuation allowance can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle we adopted fasb interpretation no 
accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations fin no 
during the year ended december  fin no 
states that companies must recognize a liability for the fair value of a legal obligation to perform asset retirement activities that are conditional on a future event if the amount can be reasonably estimated 
this interpretation applies to certain provisions in our facility lease agreements in the united states and the united kingdom 
some of our leases stipulate that any leasehold improvements performed by us with landlord approval become the landlord s property upon expiration of the lease 
however  some landlords further reserve the right to make the determination as to whether the premises must be returned to their original condition  normal wear and tear excepted  at our expense 
as a result  we were required to estimate the fair value of our legal obligation to perform asset retirement activities upon a future lease termination date 
the actual costs to perform these activities may differ from our estimate 
additional information about the cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
contingencies from time to time  we are subject to potential claims and assessments from third parties 
we are also subject to various governmental  client and vendor audits 
we continually assess whether or not such claims have merit and warrant accrual under the probable and estimable criteria of statement of financial accounting standard no 
accounting for contingencies 
where appropriate  we accrue estimates of anticipated liabilities in the financial statements 
such estimates are subject to change and may affect our results of operations and our cash flows

net cash provided by operating activities 
for the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities was million  a decrease from cash flows from operations of million for the year ended december  primarily due to higher net earnings before depreciation in cash flows from operations for the year ended december  resulted primarily from net earnings before depreciation  offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventories 
the increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to increased sales and increases in sales with terms longer than days 
the increase in inventories was due primarily to opportunistic purchases and increased inventories for our integration labs and upcoming projects with large enterprise and public sector clients 
additionally  we decreased the outstanding balance on our inventories financing facility 
cash flows from operations for the year ended december  resulted primarily from net earnings before depreciation and the gain on the sale of our investment in a discontinued operation  offset by an increase in accounts receivable and inventories due primarily to increased sales compared to the prior year 
our consolidated cash flow operating metrics for the years ended december   and are as follows days sales outstanding in ending accounts receivable dsos inventory turns excluding inventories not available for sale days purchases outstanding in ending accounts payable dpos the increase in dsos is due primarily to an increase in net sales with terms longer than days  primarily related to our large enterprise and public sector clients 
the decrease in inventory turns is primarily due to the increase in inventories primarily related to opportunistic purchases and increased inventories for our integration labs and upcoming projects with large enterprise and public sector clients 
the million of inventories not available for sale at december  represents inventories segregated pursuant to binding client contracts  which will be recorded as net sales when the criteria for sales recognition are met 
client payments in advance of shipment of million at december  primarily represent payments received from clients pursuant to these contracts 
the decrease in dpos is due primarily to utilizing early pay discounts from suppliers and to the timing of payments at year end 
if sales continue to increase in the future  we expect that cash flow from operations will be used  at least partially  to fund working capital as we typically increase balances in our inventories and pay our suppliers on average terms that are shorter than the average terms granted to our clients in order to take advantage of supplier discounts 
net cash used in investing activities 
in january  we received million owed to us by an underwriter related to the sale of a discontinued operation

capital expenditures in were offset by proceeds from the sale of a discontinued operation and proceeds from the sale of a building 
see note to consolidated financial statements in item of this report for further discussion about our discontinued operation 
we expect total capital expenditures in to be between million and million 
net cash provided by used in financing activities 
during the year ended december   cash was provided by borrowings on our short term financing facility and our line of credit and by cash received from common stock issuances as a result of stock option exercises 
cash was primarily used to make repayments on our short term financing facility and to repurchase shares of our common stock 
in january  our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program that allows us to purchase up to an additional million of our common stock 
we anticipate that cash flow from operations  together with the funds available under our financing facilities  will be adequate to support our presently anticipated cash and working capital requirements for operations through and longer if we successfully renew our short term finance facility at or prior to the expiration of its current term on december  we have no reason to believe the facility will not be renewed at the end of its current term 
as part of our long term growth strategy  we intend to consider acquisition opportunities from time to time  which may require additional debt or equity financing

during the three months ended december   we recorded   net of taxes  for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for the adoption of fin no 
fin no 
states that companies must recognize a liability for the fair value of a legal obligation to perform asset retirement activities that are conditional on a future event if the amount can be reasonably estimated 
this interpretation applies to certain provisions in our facility lease agreements in the united states and the united kingdom 
some of our leases stipulate that any leasehold improvements performed by the tenant with landlord approval become the landlord s property upon expiration of the lease 
however  some landlords further reserve the right to make the determination as to whether the premises must be returned to their original condition  normal wear and tear excepted  at our expense 
because of these provisions  fin no 
now requires us to record a liability for the estimated fair value of this legal obligation to return the premises to the original condition with the offset recorded as an increase to the cost of the leasehold improvements 
we estimate that we will owe million in future years in connection with returning our leased facilities to original condition

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued acquisitions our strategy includes the possible acquisition of other businesses to expand or complement our operations 
the magnitude  timing and nature of any future acquisitions will depend on a number of factors  including the availability of suitable acquisition candidates  the negotiation of acceptable terms  our financial capabilities and general economic and business conditions 
financing of future acquisitions would result in the utilization of cash  incurrence of additional debt  issuance of stock or a combination of any of the three 
inflation we have historically not been adversely affected by inflation  as technological advances and competition within the it industry have generally caused the prices of the products we sell to decline and product life cycles tend to be short 
this requires our growth in unit sales to exceed the decline in prices in order to increase our net sales 
we believe that most price increases could be passed on to our clients  as prices charged by us are not set by long term contracts  however  as a result of competitive pressure  there can be no assurance that the full effect of any such price increases could be passed on to our clients

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we have interest rate exposure arising from our financing facilities  which have variable interest rates 
these variable interest rates are affected by changes in short term interest rates 
we manage interest rate exposure by maintaining a conservative debt to equity ratio 
we believe that the effect  if any  of reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows will not be material 
our financing facilities expose net earnings to changes in short term interest rates since interest rates on the underlying obligations are variable 
borrowings outstanding under the interest bearing financing facilities totaled million at december   and the interest rates attributable to this outstanding balance were and per annum at december  a change in net earnings resulting from a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates would not be material 
foreign currency exchange risk our revenue  expense  and capital purchasing activities are primarily transacted in us dollars 
however  since a portion of our business is operated in the united kingdom and canada in their respective functional currencies  we do have foreign currency translation exposure for changes in exchange rates for the canadian dollar and the british pound sterling 
additionally  our us operation outsources one of its call centers to our canadian operations for a monthly charge  which creates some foreign currency transaction exposure 
accordingly  changes in exchange rates  and in particular a strengthening of the us dollar  may adversely affect our consolidated financial statements as expressed in us dollars 
we monitor our foreign currency exposure and may from time to time enter into hedging transactions to manage this exposure 
there were no hedging transactions during the year ended december   and there were no hedging instruments outstanding at december
