critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we regularly evaluate and discuss with our audit committee the accounting policies and estimates we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements 
estimates are used for  but not limited to  revenue recognition under the percentage of completion method  impairment assessments of goodwill and other long lived assets  realization of deferred tax assets  allowance for doubtful accounts  and litigation related contingencies 
these estimates are based on historical experience  project management  and various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable given the particular facts and circumstances 
although we believe that our estimates  assumptions and judgments are reasonable  they are 
table of contents based upon information presently available 
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions  judgments or conditions 
the securities and exchange commission has defined critical accounting policies as those that are most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results of operations  and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates 
based on this definition  we have identified the critical accounting policies discussed below 
we have other significant accounting policies  which also involve the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions that are integral to understanding our results of operations 
for a complete discussion of all significant accounting policies  see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 for our time and materials and fixed price outsourcing contracts 
for those service contracts which are billed on a time and materials basis  we recognize revenue as the services are performed and after we have a signed contract 
in our time and materials contracts our effort  measured by our time incurred  represents the contractual milestones or output measure which is the contractual earnings pattern 
for our fixed price it outsourcing  maintenance contracts and transaction processing we recognize revenue ratably over the applicable outsourcing or maintenance period as the services are performed continuously over the contract period 
for our contracts to design  develop or modify complex information systems based upon the client s specifications  we recognize revenue on a percentage of completion basis in accordance with statement of position the percentage of completion is determined by relating the actual cost of labor performed to date to the estimated total cost of labor for each contract 
this method is followed where reasonably dependable estimates of revenue and cost can be made 
estimates of total contract revenue and cost are continuously monitored during the term of the contract  and recorded revenue and costs are subject to revision as the contract progresses 
such revisions  which may result in increases or decreases to revenue and income  are reflected in the financial statements in the period in which they are first identified 
if the estimate indicates a loss on a particular contract  a provision is made for the entire estimated loss without reference to the percentage of completion 
covansys periodically enters into contracts that include multiple element arrangements  which may include any combination of services  software  support maintenance  and the re sale of hardware or software 
contracts entered into after june  containing multiple elements or deliverables are segmented into separate units of accounting where the separate elements represent separate earnings processes in accordance with eitf revenue is allocated among the elements based on the relative fair values of the elements and are recognized in accordance with our policies for the separate elements unless  as required by staff accounting bulletin no 
 the undelivered elements are essential to the functionality of the delivered elements 
in circumstances where an undelivered element is essential to the functionality of the delivered element  no revenue is recognized for the delivered element until the undelivered element is delivered 
retainages  which are not material for any of the periods presented  are included in revenue earned in excess of billings in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
revenue earned in excess of billings is primarily comprised of revenue recognized on certain contracts in excess of contractual billings on such contracts 
impairment of long lived assets 
we review the recoverability of our long lived assets  including property and equipment when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
the assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of the asset from expected future pre tax cash flows of the related asset group or operating segment 
if these cash flows are less than the carrying value of such asset  an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between estimated fair value and carrying value 
the measurement of impairment requires 
table of contents management to make estimates of these cash flows related to long lived assets  as well as other fair value determinations 
computer software 
we perform research to develop software for various business applications 
the cost of such research is charged to expense when incurred 
when the technological feasibility of the product is established  subsequent costs are capitalized in accordance with sfas computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed 
capitalized software costs are amortized on a product by product basis 
amortization is recorded on the straight line method over the estimated economic life of the product  generally five years  commencing when such product is available 
the establishment of technological feasibility and the ongoing assessment of the recoverability of these costs require considerable judgment by management with respect to certain external factors including  but not limited to  anticipated future gross product revenue  estimated economic product lives and changes in software and hardware technology 
these assumptions are reevaluated and adjusted as necessary at the end of each accounting period 
management reviews the valuation and amortization of capitalized development costs 
we periodically consider the value of future cash flows attributable to the capitalized development costs in evaluating potential impairment of the asset 
amounts charged to expense for research and development of computer software were not material for the years ended december   and goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets related to businesses acquired 
the company continually evaluates whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the recorded amount of goodwill may warrant revision or that the remaining balance may not be recoverable 
the company tests for impairment of its reporting units by comparing fair value to carrying value 
fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow methodology 
the results of the company s annual impairment analysis concluded that no impairment existed at december  income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
realization of deferred tax assets associated with the company s future deductible temporary differences and net operating loss carryforwards is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income prior to their expiration 
although realization of the deferred tax assets is not assured  management believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized through future taxable income 
the company utilized domestic net operating loss carryforwards during the effective tax rate was for the full year on a quarterly basis  management assesses whether it remains more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized
