item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview quixote corporation the company  we  our or us and its subsidiaries develop  manufacture and market highway and transportation safety products to protect  direct and inform motorists  pedestrians and road workers in both domestic and international markets 
our operations are comprised of three reportable segments within the highway and transportation safety industry  concentrating on safety problems and designing products to provide transportation safety solutions 
during the third quarter of fiscal we expanded the number of reportable segments from two to three segments 
our three reportable segments are the manufacture and sale of highway and transportation safety products which protect and direct  the manufacture and sale of products and services which inform  and the manufacture and sale of products which are used for intersection control 
the protect and direct segment provides solutions for improving safety on the roads either by minimizing the severity of crashes that occur or by preventing crashes from occurring by directing or guiding traffic 
the primary product lines within the protect and direct segment include energy absorbing products such as crash cushions  truck mounted attenuators  sand filled barrels and water filled barriers  and directing and guiding products such as flexible post delineators and glare screen systems 
the inform segment provides solutions for improving traffic flow and safety on roads and runways by providing information 
the primary product lines within the inform segment include advanced sensing products which measure distance  count and classify vehicles  weather sensing systems  computerized highway advisory radio transmitting systems  and other transportation equipment 
the intersection control segment provides solutions for controlling intersections  including intelligent intersection traffic control systems  pedestrian signals  video detection equipment and other transportation equipment 
our products are sold by both a direct sales force and a distribution network to customers in the highway construction and safety business  state departments of transportation  county and local governments and other governmental transportation agencies 
the domestic market for highway and transportation safety products is directly affected by federal  state and local governmental policies and budgets 
a portion of our sales is ultimately financed by funds provided to the states by the federal government 
historically  these funds have covered to of the cost of highway safety projects on roads constructed or maintained with federal assistance 
seasonality affects our business with generally a higher level of sales in our fourth fiscal quarter 
results of operations summary our financial results for fiscal were below our expectations 
we began to see improved growth prospects after the new federal highway spending bill safetea lu was signed in august in two of our three segments 
the last six year federal bill expired on september  and was extended eleven times over almost two years 
however  the performance of our intersection control segment continued to be substandard 
during fiscal  sales increased over last year and we are seeing increased order activity in most areas of our business 
we believe the increase in sales and order activity reflects the early signs of improvements in our industry now that a highway bill is in place 
we were encouraged to see sales growth of in our inform segment and in our protect and direct segment  as well as increased profitability  during the fiscal year 
although sales for the intersection control segment  which is comprised of the operations of peek traffic corporation peek traffic and us traffic corporation ust  increased from the prior year  operating results in that segment continued to be substandard and in april  we approved a plan to restructure that business 
in accordance with the restructuring plan  we are in the process of discontinuing certain low margin and non core product lines 
as part of the restructuring plan  we sold the portable variable message sign  illuminated street lighting and tunnel lighting product lines in june we are in the process of closing two facilities  moving the remaining intersection control products to our palmetto  florida and bedford  pennsylvania facilities and also outsourcing non core manufacturing activities 
in addition  as a result of the continued poor performance of this segment  we recorded non cash asset impairment charges of  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements and future outlook for further information 
the following table sets forth selected key operating statistics relating to the company s financial results for the years ended june dollar amounts in thousands  except per share data revenues by segment protect and direct inform intersection control geographic revenues domestic international operating income loss by segment protect and direct inform intersection control unallocated corporate gross profit percentage selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales diluted loss per share includes  in non cash asset impairment charges

includes  in non cash asset impairment charges 
revenues our net sales for fiscal increased to  from  for due to sales increases across all operating segments as described below 
our net sales for fiscal decreased to  from  for primarily due to lower sales in our intersection control segment as further described below 
geographic international sales for fiscal increased by  or  to  compared to  for fiscal  primarily due to increases in the intersection control segment  where international sales increased  or  to  the increase in international sales in the intersection control segment was primarily due to increased sales of traffic signals in latin america and also to increased sales in europe and canada 
international sales for the inform segment increased to  international sales for the protect and direct segment increased only slightly after the increase achieved in the prior year 
domestic sales for fiscal increased to  from  due to sales increases in all operating segments and particularly in the protect and direct segment 
international sales for fiscal increased  or  to  compared to  for fiscal  primarily due to increases in the protect and direct segment  where international sales increased to  the increase in international sales in the protect and direct segment was due to both sales increases in established markets and to sales to customers in countries which had not previously purchased those products from the protect and direct segment 
international sales in the inform segment increased to  international sales in the intersection control segment increased to  in part due to the acquisition of peek traffic in fiscal domestic sales for fiscal decreased to  from  due primarily to decreased sales of products within the intersection control segment further described below 
protect and direct net sales for the protect and direct segment for fiscal increased to  from  for fiscal due to increases across most major product lines and particularly truck mounted attenuators tma s  delineators and permanent crash cushions  which were offset somewhat by lower sales of parts 
the sales increases were attributable to increased spending on workzone and other highway safety projects since the enactment of the federal highway bill 
in addition  we saw increased spending on new products such as the quest crash cushion and the safestop trailer tma 
net sales for the protect and direct segment for fiscal increased slightly to  from  for fiscal due to strong international sales growth  as mentioned above 
domestic sales decreased by 
we believe that the decrease in domestic sales volume was due to state budgetary constraints and transportation funding uncertainties caused by the continued delay in the passage of the new federal highway funding bill 
increased sales of permanent crash cushions and triton barrier products were largely offset by decreased sales of truck mounted attenuators  sand filled barrels  delineator products and parts 
sales of permanent crash cushions increased slightly and sales of parts and tma products decreased slightly 
inform net sales for the inform segment for fiscal increased to  from  for fiscal due to increased sales of highway advisory products which achieved record sales for the year 
in addition  sales of weather sensing systems increased during fiscal we believe products within the inform segment also benefited from the passage of the federal highway bill as spending on these products is more discretionary 
net sales for the inform segment for fiscal decreased to  from  for fiscal the decrease in sales was primarily due to lower sales volume of highway advisory radio products  which were largely offset by increased sales volume of weather and traffic sensing products 
intersection control net sales for the company s intersection control segment for fiscal increased to  from  for fiscal due in part to the strong international sales growth mentioned above 
this sales growth was less than expected and along with the continued operating underperformance  we approved a restructuring plan for this segment as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
net sales for the intersection control segment for fiscal decreased to  from  for fiscal the decrease was primarily due to lower sales which continued to be affected by ongoing state and municipal budgetary issues  and which resulted in depressed order flows and sales levels significantly lower than planned 
the acquisition of peek traffic  effective december  contributed net sales of  from the period july  to november  not comparable to fiscal gross profit margin the company s gross profit margin for fiscal was compared to for fiscal the gross margin in the protect and direct segment decreased due to increased raw material costs  higher freight costs and unfavorable product mix 
the gross margin for the inform segment increased due to volume efficiencies related to the higher level of sales 
the gross margin in the intersection control segment decreased due to unfavorable product mix and plant inefficiencies associated with the restructuring activities 
our gross profit margin for fiscal was compared to for fiscal as higher gross margins for the inform segment and intersection control segment were largely offset by lower gross profit margins in the protect and direct segment due to increased raw material costs  particularly steel costs which were not entirely passed along to customers 
the gross margin for the inform and intersection control segments increased modestly due to favorable sales mix 
selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses for fiscal decreased  or  to  from  for fiscal selling and administrative expenses in the protect and direct segment decreased due to the elimination of costs incurred by our former captive manufacturer which was sold last year  and due to lower marketing expenses 
selling and administrative expenses in the intersection control segment decreased primarily due to the realization of cost reduction efforts over the past year 
selling and administrative costs for the inform segment increased partially due to variable expenses related to the increased level of their sales 
selling and administrative expenses for fiscal include  in expense related to the adoption in fiscal of fas r requiring the expensing of stock options as further discussed in note selling and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of sales to for fiscal compared to for primarily due to the increase in sales and the realization of cost reduction efforts 
selling and administrative expenses for fiscal increased  or  to  from  for fiscal expenses increased due to the inclusion of peek traffic expenses of  for the period from july  to november  not comparable to fiscal expenses relating to sarbanes oxley compliance and employee related expenses also increased 
selling and administrative expenses increased significantly in the intersection control segment due to the inclusion of peek traffic 
selling and administrative expenses in the inform segment also increased  primarily due to increased variable costs related to the higher sales level of weather sensing products 
selling and administrative expenses increased only slightly in the protect and direct segment 
selling and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of sales to for fiscal compared to for primarily due to the decline in sales and the company s primarily fixed cost structure 
research and development research and development expenditures were  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal expenditures increased across all operating segments as we work on the development of innovative new products to address safety needs both here and abroad 
research and development expenditures were  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal the increase of  was due primarily to increased expenditures by the intersection control segment to enhance and upgrade their product suite 
expenditures in the inform and protect and direct segments also increased as they develop new products and application extensions to existing products 
gain on sale of assets we recorded a gain of  in fiscal in the inform segment due to the sale of the weather forecasting product line in our inform segment 
we received proceeds of  from the sale  which occurred during the fourth quarter 
we recorded a gain of  in fiscal due to the sale of certain machinery and equipment of a captive manufacturer of the protect and direct segment and received proceeds of  we also received proceeds of  from the sale of land and recorded a gain on that sale of  for the protect and direct segment in the second quarter of fiscal which was reclassified from other income during the fourth quarter of fiscal gain on legal settlements as further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we recorded a gain of  in fiscal in the intersection control segment due to the settlement of legal claims with the sellers of us traffic ust and peek traffic corporation peek traffic 
restructuring costs as further discussed in future outlook and in note to the consolidated financial statements  we recorded  in restructuring costs in the intersection control segment 
included in the restructuring costs are proceeds of  related to the sale of the portable variable message sign and illuminated street lighting product lines and related costs resulting in a loss of  the sale proceeds more than offset all the cash costs of restructuring through june asset impairment charges in fiscal year  results at our intersection control segment continued to be substandard and we adopted a restructuring plan in april as further discussed in note as part of the restructuring plan  we sold the portable variable message sign  illuminated street lighting and tunnel lighting product lines and we discontinued other low margin and non core product lines 
as a result of the continued poor performance and the company s impairment review in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we determined that the carrying amounts of certain long lived assets were no longer recoverable based on estimated future operating cash flows to be generated by those assets  which were lower than previously projected 
as further discussed below and in note  we recorded asset impairment charges in the intersection control segment of  or  net of income tax benefits  or per diluted share 
the charges included  for goodwill and  for fixed assets 
our fiscal annual impairment review did not result in any impairment charges 
in fiscal  the prolonged delay in the passage of new federal transportation funding legislation as well as ongoing state and municipal budget issues had a significant negative impact on our company as a whole 
in addition  ust operating results were much lower than expected 
as a result of these factors and our impairment review in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we determined that the carrying amounts of certain long lived assets were no longer recoverable based on estimated future cash flows to be generated by those assets  which were lower than previously projected 
we recorded asset impairment charges for fiscal of  or  net of income tax benefits  or per diluted share 
the charges within the inform segment included  relating to goodwill and  for intangible assets 
the charges within the intersection control segment included  relating to goodwill   for intangible assets and  for fixed assets 
operating profit loss the operating loss of  for fiscal compared to operating profit of  for fiscal the change was primarily due to asset impairment and restructuring costs incurred in fiscal  which were only partially offset by improved gross profit margins and lower selling and administrative costs as discussed above and the gains on legal settlements and sale of assets 
the fiscal operating loss includes asset impairment charges of  restructuring costs of  gains on legal settlements of  and a gain on the sale of assets of  operating profit for the protect and direct segment increased  to  for fiscal from  for fiscal which included  in gain on sale of assets  primarily due to lower selling and administrative costs as discussed above 
operating profit for the inform segment increased  to  for fiscal  including  in a gain on sale of assets  from  for fiscal primarily due to the higher sales and volume efficiencies related to the higher level of sales 
the operating loss for the intersection control segment was  including asset impairment charges of  restructuring costs of  and a gain on legal settlements of  compared to an operating loss for fiscal of  operating profit of  for fiscal compared to an operating loss of  for fiscal the change was primarily due to the asset impairment charges of  included in the fiscal operating loss 
operating profit for the protect and direct segment decreased  to  for fiscal from  for fiscal primarily due to lower gross margins caused by increased material costs 
operating profit for the protect and direct segment for fiscal included  in gain on sale of assets 
operating profit for the inform segment increased  to  for fiscal from the operating loss of  for fiscal primarily due to the asset impairment charges of  recorded in fiscal the operating loss for the intersection control segment was  compared to an operating loss for fiscal of  which included the asset impairment charges of  interest expense interest expense for fiscal increased  to  from  in fiscal the increase was due primarily to higher interest rates and also to the higher level of average long term debt outstanding during fiscal the interest rate on the company s credit agreement is based on prime or libor and a fixed rate  plus a margin 
the weighted average interest rate was as of june  compared to a weighted average rate of as of june  the interest rate on the company s convertible debt issued during fiscal is 
the company expects the average interest rate during fiscal on all debt to be approximately 
interest expense for fiscal increased  to  from  in fiscal the increase was due primarily to higher interest rates  and also to the higher level of average long term debt outstanding during fiscal the interest rate on our credit agreement was based on prime or libor and a fixed rate  plus a margin 
the weighted average rate was as of june  compared to a weighted average rate of as of june  the interest rate on our convertible debt issued during fiscal was 
provision for income taxes the income tax benefit for fiscal was  reflecting a effective tax rate 
included in the income tax benefit for fiscal was  relating to the asset impairment charges 
we expect to provide for income taxes at a rate of for fiscal however  this rate may be negatively impacted based on management s ongoing evaluation as to whether it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets recorded are realizable 
the income tax benefit for fiscal was  reflecting a effective tax rate 
the income tax benefit for fiscal was  which included  relating to the asset impairment charges recorded in the fourth quarter and a  income tax benefit related to the favorable settlement of a tax audit recorded during the third quarter 
net earnings loss the net loss for fiscal was  or per diluted share  compared to a net loss of  or per diluted share  for included in the net loss for fiscal were the asset impairment charges of  net of taxes  or per diluted share 
also included in the net loss for fiscal was  in stock option expense  or per diluted share 
the net loss for fiscal was  or per diluted share  compared to a net loss of  or per diluted share  for included in the net loss for fiscal were the asset impairment charges of  net of taxes  or per diluted share 
financial condition liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of funds historically have been cash flows from operations and borrowings from banks and other sources 
the company had cash and cash equivalents of  as of june  and access to additional funds of approximately million in bank lines of credit 
our outstanding borrowings were  or of total capitalization  as of june   of which  was outstanding on our bank credit facility 
this compares to  or of total capitalization  as of june  during february  we sold  of convertible senior subordinated notes due february  in a private placement and received net proceeds of  the net proceeds were used to pay off our bank term loan and reduce the amount of its revolving credit agreement 
the conversion price is per share  which represented a premium over the closing price of our stock on the close of the transaction 
if fully converted  the notes would convert into approximately  shares of our common stock 
the shares are not included in earnings per share as they are currently anti dilutive until earnings per share reach approximately per share 
the notes are fully redeemable by the company at any time after february  at of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest 
the investors may require us to repurchase the notes in cash at a price equal to of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any  on february   or we entered into a new secured credit agreement during april with one bank which currently expires on february  we believe that this collateralized credit agreement is an important source of liquidity 
the credit agreement provides for a million revolving credit facility  with a million subfacility for letters of credit issued by the bank or its affiliates 
the revolving credit availability is based on a formula of eligible accounts receivable  eligible inventory  machinery and equipment and real estate  subject to a minimum excess collateral availability factor 
effective june   the company is also required to maintain a maximum senior leverage ratio 
we are in compliance with these covenants and expect to remain in compliance through fiscal under certain conditions  we may request a release of all security interests at which time we would no longer be subject to a borrowing base formula  but would be subject to several financial covenants 
the agreement may be renewed for one additional year on each anniversary date upon mutual consent of the company and the bank 
cash flows cash flows provided by operations were  during fiscal this compares with  in fiscal and  in fiscal in each of the past three years  cash flow from operations was primarily derived from earnings before non cash expenses such as depreciation  amortization and asset impairment charges 
the increase in cash generated from operating activities in fiscal is primarily due to the increase in earnings before non cash expenses 
investing activities used cash of  during fiscal  compared to  in fiscal and  in fiscal expenditures during fiscal included  for capital expenditures  which were more than offset by proceeds received from the sale of assets 
financing activities used cash of  during fiscal  compared to cash used of  during fiscal and cash provided of  in fiscal during fiscal  we borrowed a net  on our outstanding revolving credit facility and paid  on other notes payable 
we received cash of  from the exercise of common stock options 
the payment of our semi annual cash dividend used cash of  as further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we paid  to purchase  shares of our common stock from the sellers of peek traffic for the treasury 
for  we anticipate needing approximately  in cash for capital expenditures 
the company may also need additional cash as it considers acquiring businesses that complement its existing operations 
the company may require additional investments in working capital to maintain growth 
the company may also need additional funds to repurchase its own common stock from time to time 
these expenditures will be financed either through the company s cash on hand  cash generated from its operations or from borrowings available under the company s bank credit facility 
we currently expect cash generated from operations to be higher in fiscal year compared to fiscal however  due to uncertainties in the restructuring of the intersection control segment  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  and the seasonality of our business  there can be no assurance that this will occur  or to what extent this will occur 
we believe that our existing cash  cash generated from operations and funds available under its existing credit facility are sufficient for all planned operating and capital requirements in the near term 
if needed and available on favorable terms  we may also enter into other debt or equity financing arrangements 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations we are subject to certain debt obligations  guarantees  commitments and contingent liabilities further described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the following table presents our contractual obligations to make future payments under contracts  such as debt and lease agreements  as of june  less than more than total year years years years dollar amounts in thousands long term debt estimated interest payments operating leases  net minimum royalty payments retirement award program purchase obligations total amount includes expected cash payments on long term debt based upon current and effective maturities as well as expected renewals 
amount includes estimated interest payments based on interest rates as of the current period 
interest rates on variable rate debt are subject to change in the future 
interest is estimated based upon current and effective maturities as well as expected renewals of long term debt currently outstanding 
retirement award is a fixed number of quixote corporation shares for each of the participants each year for which the income tax obligation is paid in cash 
purchase obligations include orders with suppliers in the normal course of business on a short term basis 
as disclosed in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements  we have entered into bid and performance related bonds associated with various contracts 
potential payments due under these bonds are related to our performance under the applicable contract 
the total amount of bid and performance related bonds that were available and undrawn as of june  was  we also have standby letters of credit covering potential workers compensation liabilities 
the total standby exposure relating to letters of credit as of june  was  future outlook we believe that prospects for increased spending for our products in fiscal will improve given the enactment of the federal transportation funding legislation  safetea lu  in august state and local governments increased spending on transportation safety in fiscal year as both national and local economies improved and we expect this trend to continue into fiscal we are seeing increased order activity in most areas of our business 
we also expect international sales to continue to be an important driver of our sales growth 
however  it is difficult to predict to what extent we will see increased spending for our products and there can be no assurance that either domestic or international sales will continue to increase 
as further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the continued underperformance of the intersection control segment resulted in our decision to rationalize that business and divest certain non core product lines 
a restructuring plan was approved by our board on april  to reduce costs through the reduction of overhead by closing two facilities and by the reduction of headcount 
as part of the restructuring plan  we sold the portable sign and the lighting product lines in june  we intend to discontinue the fixed overhead sign portion of that business 
within the remaining intersection control business  we will outsource non core manufacturing  but continue to assemble and test products 
in connection with the restructuring plan  we expect to record total cash and non cash charges of approximately million 
most of the substantial restructuring charges are expected to be incurred before the end of our fiscal second quarter 
we expect the plan will result in profitability for the intersection control business beginning in the third quarter of fiscal with annualized operating cost savings of approximately to million 
however  there can be no assurance that we will achieve that level of savings 
after the sale and discontinuation of product lines  annualized revenues for the intersection control segment are estimated to be approximately million from million for fiscal for fiscal  we estimate depreciation and amortization expense to be approximately million 
we historically experience fluctuation in our gross profit margin from quarter to quarter primarily due to sales volume related to seasonality  variability in product mix and changes in our competitive environment 
in addition  we have acquired complementary businesses over the past several years and  as part of our strategy  may continue to acquire complementary businesses 
the gross profit margins of certain acquired product lines within our inform and intersection control segments are lower than our historical gross profit margin as we experience rigorous competition in selling certain product lines because they are generally sold through a bidding process  these trends are adversely affecting our gross profit margin and we do not believe these trends will improve in the near future 
significant accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
management s estimates also affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
in addition  certain normal and recurring estimates are made including estimates in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  inventory valuation reserves  valuation allowance on deferred tax assets  health care liabilities and determining stock based compensation expense 
these estimates are made using management s best judgment given relevant factors and available data 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
note to our june  consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies  methods and estimates used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
there have been no material changes in accounting policies  methods and estimates used by management except for the adoption of sfas no 
revised  share based payment 
in the opinion of management  we do not have any individual accounting policy or use any individual estimate that is critical to the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
in most instances  we must use an accounting policy or method because it is the only policy or method permitted under us gaap 
we believe the following significant accounting policies and methods used by the company are the most important to the presentation of our financial statements revenue recognition revenues  net of discounts and allowances  are recognized when either services have been rendered or both title and risk of loss of products have been transferred to unaffiliated customers 
additionally  we ensure that collection of the resulting receivable is probable  persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  and the revenue is fixed or determinable 
provision for estimated uncollectible amounts and credit memos is made based upon management s analysis of bad debts and credit memos 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
actual costs are used to value raw materials and supplies 
standard costs  which approximate actual costs  are used to value finished goods and work in process 
standard costs include raw materials  direct labor and manufacturing overhead 
provision for potentially obsolete or slow moving inventory is made based on management s analysis of inventory levels  ages and salability 
long lived assets long lived assets include such items as goodwill  patents  product rights  other intangible assets and property  plant and equipment 
for purposes of evaluating the recoverability of long lived assets  we assess the possibility of obsolescence  demand  new technology  competition  and other pertinent economic factors and trends that may have an impact on the value or remaining lives of these assets 
amortized long lived assets including amortized intangible assets and property  plant and equipment held and used by us are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable in relation to future undiscounted cash flows of underlying asset groups 
the net carrying value of assets not recoverable is reduced to fair value 
fair values of amortized long lived assets are determined based upon the performance of a fair value appraisal 
patents and other finite lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight line or systematic method over the life of the patent or intangible asset 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or when a triggering event occurs 
the indefinite lived intangible asset impairment test is performed by comparing the fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying value in a one step analysis 
if the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying value  the intangible asset is written down to its fair value 
the goodwill impairment test is performed at the reporting unit level and is a two step analysis 
first  the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its book value 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its book value  we perform a hypothetical purchase price allocation based on the reporting unit s fair value to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than its carrying value  the goodwill is written down to its implied fair value 
fair values are determined using present value techniques 
as discussed further in note to our june  consolidated financial statements  as a result of our annual impairment review during fiscal  we recorded non cash asset impairment charges of  relating to goodwill and amortized long lived assets of the intersection control segment 
our annual impairment review resulted in no impairment charges for fiscal year as a result of our annual impairment review during fiscal  we recorded non cash asset impairment charges of  relating to goodwill  other indefinite lived intangible assets and amortized long lived assets of the intersection control and inform segments 
the impairment review is highly judgmental and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions have a significant impact on the amount of any impairment charge recorded 
estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flow methods and are dependent upon assumptions of future sales trends  market conditions and cash flows of each reporting unit over several years 
actual cash flows in the future may differ significantly from those previously forecasted 
other significant assumptions include growth rates and the discount rate applicable to future cash flows 
restructuring charges we account for restructuring activities in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
generally  costs associated with the exit or disposal activity are recognized when the liability is incurred 
costs related to employee separation arrangements requiring future service beyond a specified minimum retention period are recognized over the service period 
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
in assessing the realizability of the deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
to the extent that any future tax benefits are not expected to be fully realized  such future tax benefits are reduced by a valuation allowance 
realization of deferred tax assets assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient taxable income so that the assets will be realized 
the factors that we consider in assessing the likelihood of realization include the forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets 
we expect the deferred tax assets currently recorded to be fully realizable  however there can be no assurance that an increased valuation allowance would not need to be recorded in the future 
stock based compensation in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised sfas no 
r  share based payment 
we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r as of july  using the modified prospective method 
under this transition method  share based compensation cost recognized in the fiscal year ended june  includes compensation cost for all share based awards which were unvested as of july  as well as compensation cost for all share based awards granted subsequent to july   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
the fair value of the options granted is being amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period 
stock option plans are more fully described in note recently issued accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates on our revolving credit agreement 
the exposure to interest rate fluctuations was significantly reduced in the third quarter of fiscal when we issued convertible debt and used the proceeds to pay down the debt issued pursuant to the revolving credit agreement 
due to the lower exposure to rate fluctuations  the use of derivative instruments in the form of non trading interest rate swaps to manage the risk has been discontinued 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  the amount of long term debt outstanding as of june  and was  and  respectively 
a hypothetical increase in interest rates would have adversely affected our and net earnings and cash flows by approximately  and  respectively 
the majority of our business is transacted in us dollars and the us dollar is considered the primary currency for the majority of our operations 
although we continue to evaluate derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate changes  we did not hold such derivatives during or assets  liabilities and commitments that are to be settled in cash and are denominated in foreign currencies for transaction purposes are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates 
however  there were no significant transaction gains or losses during  or and we do not believe we are currently exposed to any material risk of loss from currency exchange fluctuations
