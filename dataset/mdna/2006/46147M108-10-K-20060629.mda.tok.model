item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
management s discussion and analysis reviews our consolidated financial condition as of march  and  the consolidated results of operations for the years ended march   and and  where appropriate  factors that may affect future financial performance 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this form k 
forward looking statements the reader is urged to read the information contained in the forward looking statements and risk factors sections at the beginning of this report for a discussion of the use of forward looking statements in this report as well as risks and uncertainties in attempting to predict our future performance based upon such statements 
overview we are a financial services holding company that  primarily through our subsidiaries  provides broker dealer  investment advisory  asset management  financial planning  insurance and related services 
we operate in a highly regulated and competitive industry that is influenced by numerous external factors such as economic conditions  marketplace liquidity and volatility  monetary policy  global and national political events  regulatory developments  competition and investor preferences 
our revenues and net earnings may be either enhanced or diminished from period to period by one or more of such external factors 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies  those described below involve a high degree of judgment and complexity 
these critical accounting policies require estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses reported in the consolidated financial statements 
due to their nature  estimates involve judgment based upon available information 
actual results or amounts could differ from estimates and the difference could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 
therefore  understanding these policies is important to understanding the reported results of operations and the financial position of the company 
valuation of securities and other assets substantially all financial instruments are reflected in the consolidated financial statements at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value 
these include cash  cash equivalents  securities purchased under agreements to resell  deposits with clearing organizations  securities owned  and securities sold but not yet purchased 
in accordance with fas  certain financial instruments are classified as trading and available for sale 
the realized gains and losses are recorded in the income statement in the period in which the transactions occurred 
the unrealized gains and losses related are reflected in other comprehensive income depending on the underlying purpose of the instrument 
where available  the company uses prices from independent sources such as listed market prices  or broker or dealer price quotations 
fair values for certain derivative contracts are derived from pricing models that consider current market and contractual prices for the underlying financial instruments or commodities  as well as time value and yield curve or volatility factors underlying the positions 
in addition  even where the value of a security is derived from an independent market price or broker or dealer quote  certain assumptions may be required to determine the fair value 
for instance  the company generally assumes that the size of positions in securities that the company holds would not be large enough to affect the quoted price of the securities if the company were to sell them  and that any such sale would happen in an orderly manner 
however  these assumptions may be incorrect and the actual value realized upon disposition could be different from the current carrying value 
revenue recognition the company has established revenue recognition policies for each of the following income item areas mutual funds variable annuities  
administration fees on errors and omissions insurance e o and renewals  advisory fees and trading revenue 
a description of the revenue recognition process related to each category is presented below 
the revenue recognition policies the company maintains are in compliance with sec staff accounting bulletin sab revenue recognition in financial statements 
mutual funds variable annuities 
mutual funds variable annuity revenue is recognized upon receipt of commissions related to each sale  which generally is settled on the trade date 
the earnings process is substantially complete at the point that the fund company distributes payment to the company 
trading 
the company earns commissions through stock purchases and sale transactions  mutual fund purchases  government and corporate bonds transactions  fee based managed accounts  and ticket charges 
the company also earns revenue in the form of b fees and interest on account balances 
the earnings process is substantially complete at trade date in accordance with the rules of the national association of securities dealers nasd and the securities and exchange commissions sec 
the company also receives credit adjustments for clearing charge adjustments that are netted against any clearing charges the company may incur for the period 
these adjustments are recognized as income in the period received unless otherwise noted by the clearing firm 
unrealized gains and losses are recorded at the time that the company reconciles its trading positions with the market value 
the unrealized gains or losses are adjusted to market until the position is settled or the trade is cancelled 
advisory fees 
our advisory fees are based on the amount of assets managed per the adv agreement between the advisor and the advisor s client 
these revenues are recorded quarterly as and when billed and are calculated on the quarter ending market value 
the company recognizes advisory fee income at the end of each quarter on fees billed for services performed during that quarter 
advisory fees relating to the management of mutual funds have been based on average daily net fund assets as specified in the company s advisory agreement and disclosed in the funds prospectuses 
these fees have been recognized monthly based on the fund trustee s administrative fee report detailing the amounts that were earned for the month 
the company in the past has elected to waive certain of these fees to allow for one of the funds to maintain its ceiling on administrative expenses 
per agreement with the trustee of the funds  the waived fees have been subject to a three year recovery period  at the end of which any uncollected fees have been permanently waived and  consequently  charged against earnings 
effective october   the company ceased its mutual funds advisory services  and its successor as fund advisor has agreed to pay to the company all such waived amounts with interest 
see note note receivable sale of asset 
administration fees 
administration fees for services rendered to its representatives respecting annual nasd license renewals and e o insurance are recognized as revenue upon registration of the representative with nasd and listing of the registered representative with the e o insurance carrier 
the funds received from the registered representative are initially recorded as unearned revenue 
the amounts  if any  collected in excess of the e o insurance premium and or fees due nasd are recognized as revenue 
marketing revenue 
revenue from marketing associated with product sales is recognized quarterly based on production levels 
marketing event revenues are recognized at the commencement of the event offset by its costs 
accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts our policies for determining whether a receivable is considered uncollectible are as follows 
loans to representatives 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we perform periodic credit evaluations and provide allowance based on our assessment of specifically identified unsecured receivables and other factors  including the representative s payment history 
once it is determined that it is both probable that a loan has been impaired and the amount of loss can reasonably be estimated  the portion of the loan balance estimated to be uncollectible is so classified and written off 
advisory fees from our mutual funds 
as disclosed in the respective mutual funds prospectuses  the company has attempted to recoup all waived advisory service fees within a three year period 
if management believed that the likelihood of collecting that receivable within the three year period was doubtful  then the company provided for an allowance in accordance with sfas no 
determinations whether to write off such fees were made annually 
effective october   the company no longer provides advisory services to mutual funds and is entitled to payment of all previously waived advisory fees by its successor as fund advisor 
see note note receivable sale of asset 
advisory fees on asset managed accounts 
uncollected balances are written off before the subsequent quarter billing 
trade receivables 
as prescribed by the sec  trade receivables usually settle within three days 
if a trade error results  the company will pursue remedies to collect on that trade error 
the company does not record a receivable resulting from a trade error that is in litigation or whose outcome is otherwise not reasonably determinable 
in such a case  the company applies any proceeds from settlements or insurance against any trade losses incurred 
capitalized software we capitalize certain software development costs that meet established criteria  in accordance with statement of position accounting for costs of computer systems developed or obtained for internal use 
off balance sheet risk the company is engaged in various trading and brokerage activities whose counterparties primarily include the general public 
in the event that counterparties do not fulfill their obligations  the company may be exposed to risk 
securities sold  but not yet purchased  represent obligations of the company to purchase the security in the market at the prevailing prices to the extent that the company does not already have the securities in its possession 
accordingly  these transactions result in off balance sheet risk when the company s satisfaction of the obligations exceeds the amount recognized in the balance sheet 
the risk of default depends on the creditworthiness of the counterparty or issuer of the instrument 
it is the company s policy to review  as necessary  the credit standings of each counterparty with which it conducts business 
commission receivables from one source were and of total receivables for the years ended march  and  respectively 
reserves the company records reserves related to legal proceedings in accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheet 
the determination of these reserve amounts requires significant judgment on the part of management 
management considers many factors including  but not limited to the amount of the claim  the amount of the loss in the client s account  the basis and validity of the claim  the possibility of wrongdoing on the part of an employee or representative of the company  previous results in similar cases  and legal precedents and case law 
each legal proceeding is reviewed with counsel in each accounting period and the reserve is adjusted as deemed appropriate by management 
any change in the reserve amount is recorded in the consolidated financial statements and is recognized as a charge credit to earnings in that period 
the assumptions of management in determining the estimates of reserves may be incorrect and the actual disposition of a legal proceeding could be greater or less than the reserve amount

revenues from commissions increased by million or for the current period compared to the prior period 
advisory services revenue also increased by million or between the same comparative periods 
the significant increase in our revenues reflects general revenue growth in the diversified investment sector of the financial services industry as well as other factors discussed below 
revenue growth continues to be supported by our efforts in recruiting sophisticated and experienced representatives who are qualified and likely to engage in brokerage services 
we had a increase in recruitment of new representatives during fiscal year ended march  compared to the prior year 
revenue growth from these new recruits generated a million or increase in corresponding revenues 
revenues of million or of this million increase  and of all current period revenues from representatives  were derived from trading or brokerage services 
our progress in recruiting representatives who are qualified and likely to engage in trading services have resulted in a increase in trading services revenue from new recruits for the year ended march  compared to the fiscal year ended march  vs

product type mutual funds  variable annuities  direct participation programs  other    trading services brokerage    advisory services    total    representatives recruited commissions 
commissions from variable annuities and trading made up the largest increase in commission revenue 
variable annuities and trading commissions represented million or  of the increase during the current period when compared to the prior period 
also  commissions from direct participation programs  which predominantly include reit s real estate investment trusts and oil and gas programs increased by million or percentage percent of total increase product type vs increase vs variable annuities    trading brokerage    mutual funds    direct participation programs    other    total commission revenue    revenue designated as trading brokerage includes revenue from mutual funds sold through our trading platform 
although commissions from variable annuities comprise the largest component of commission revenue  the company s revenue base has been shifting toward the brokerage area  which represented of the total increase in commission revenues 
an increasing number of our representatives conduct their business in brokerage accounts which  in turn  improves our margins 
the trend toward brokerage reflects a concerted effort on our part to recruit sophisticated representatives with series licenses who utilize our brokerage platform 
as a result of the shift toward brokerage products  the company experienced higher overall profit margins from sales of the resulting product mix during the current period compared to the prior period 
see gross margins 
advisory fees 
advisory services typically provide significantly higher margins than traditional broker dealer products such as variable annuities and mutual funds 
see gross margins 
accordingly  we have been encouraging our representatives to convert more of their business to advisory services 
although we do not control which advisory services our representatives provide for their clients  we continue to make concerted efforts to attract them to our proprietary advisory services programs through seminars  trade shows and direct marketing 
fees from our rep directed asset managed program  a map  where asset allocation and other investment advisory services are provided directly by our independent representatives  continue to be the leading source of revenue in this category 
revenues from this program grew by million or to million compared to million the prior period 
supported by our clearing firm s trading platform this program is becoming increasingly popular with our representatives because of the opportunities it provides to deliver to their clients superior asset management services at a potentially lower cost and the potential for increased overall market performance 
revenues from our fund managed f map and separately managed s map accounts  where investment advisory services are provided by epa and ica instead of our independent representatives  increased by million or between the comparative periods 
over recent quarters revenues from the fund managed category have slightly declined due to the termination of accounts where asset values have fallen below a minimum level 
also  management has not been aggressively marketing this program compared to the rep directed asset managed program and s map program 
revenues from asset managed programs where investment services are provided by outside advisors  decreased slightly for the year ended march  epa  and more recently  ica have been continuing to direct their marketing efforts away from these third party management programs and more toward their internal  proprietary asset managed models 
epa and ica have been providing sales  marketing  trading platform and other technical support to our representatives to enable them to deliver improved investment advisory services 
revenues from advisory services provided to mutual funds decreased by million when compared to the prior period  reflecting the termination during the current year of the company s management agreement pursuant to which it had been providing advisory services to mutual funds 
our mutual funds constituted only million or of the total advisory services revenue category for the year ended march   and million or for the fiscal year ended march  our current success to our advisory services program recently has been a result of an enhanced online platform that we offer to our representatives  from our clearing firm 
this enables them to perform their services of asset allocation in a more cost effective way 
in addition  these savings have been passed on to the client  resulting in lower fees charged for an improved service 
other fee income 
other fee income decreased by million or  resulting mostly from a million decrease in administrative fees for providing regulatory services to our representatives in connection with annual renewals of their nasd licenses and errors and omissions e o policy enrollment 
most of this change stems from the timing in the collection of an e o adjustment during the first quarter for year ended march  there was no e o adjustment for year ended march  offsetting the above mentioned decrease was a million increase in financial planning fees from sophisticated representatives providing portfolio strategy for their clients asset managed accounts 
in addition  we experienced a million dollar increase in other administrative fees to cover the increase in compliance costs for the maintenance of books and records 
finally  there was a million decrease in administration fees on asset managed accounts as a result of the termination of several of these accounts when asset balances fell below minimum levels 
marketing revenue 
net marketing revenues decreased by million or  reflecting a million increase in the cost to host our annual national convention held in boston in october and our diamond achiever conference in march offsetting this decrease was a million dollar increase in marketing support revenues from product companies 
we also saw a million increase in marketing support revenues from our regional meetings and sales of ancillary items such as apparel  bags  hats with our logo and blast email services 
other income 
other income  consisting primarily of interest and dividends and gains or losses on investments  increased by million for the comparative current period to the prior period 
the majority of the increase came primarily from interest earned on account balances due to the increase in its daily average balance 
gross margins gross margin rose by million or to million for the current period primarily due to a million or increase in gross margin derived from trading over the prior period 
trading 
the increase in gross margin from trading reflects an increase in brokerage commissions and a reduction in clearing charges due to increased sales volume  increased commission retention rates  and more fee income within corporate accounts 
contributing to this improvement in gross margins from trading was a million increase in the margin from our trails and from money market on account balances and a million contribution from net trading commissions 
the primary increase in gross margins from trading commission is derived from a million increase in net trade commissions from lower producing payout representatives 
the combined effect of these factors was an increase in our average payout retention in brokerage services from in the prior period to in the current period which  in turn  contributed to an increase in our gross trading margin from to 
through our efforts we are continuing to recruit more capable and experiences representatives who can offer a broader range of brokerage products which have a greater profit margin compared to the normal mutual fund and variable annuity products 
another factor contributing to the increase in gross margin from trading was that there was a million trading error in april of that was realized in fiscal year ended march  there was no trade error that had a material impact on our financials during fiscal year ended march  advisory services 
advisory services profit margin increased by million or for the current period to the prior period 
the majority of the profit margin in advisory services stems from our rep directed asset managed programs that make it possible for representatives managing client accounts to trade directly online using our automated trading platform 
resulting increases in the representative s trading volume effectively increase the company s commission revenues and gross margin 
additionally  by processing more transactions at a stable fixed cost  our enhanced trading technology fosters economies of scale that control operating expenses required to process the increased trade volume 
although we experienced an increase in profit margin from advisory services during the comparative period  our retention rate decreased from to 
there were a couple of factors contributing to this retention percentage decrease 
advisory fee rates derived from rep directed business declined slightly  reflecting decreases in the commission retention rate for client accounts whose balances reached levels that trigger automatic retention rate reductions 
also  as a result of terminating the management agreement associated with the mutual funds we no longer receive any advisory fees from that revenue component which directly contributed to our margin 
although our retention rate from advisory services decreased compared to the prior period  this category on a percentage retention basis still retains a higher profit margin than most of the other products or services we and our representatives provide 
see gross margin table 
mutual funds  variable annuities  etc 
profit margins from mutual fund sales  variable annuity sales  direct participation programs and other check and application distribution programs contributed million or of the total gross margin compared to million or during the prior period 
as presented in the previous gross margin table  margin from our check and application distribution programs comprised the greatest contribution to our overall profit margin  however  trading achieved the largest percentage increase for the comparative period of march  versus march  commission expenses commission payouts to our independent representatives  as a percentage of commissioned revenues  remained virtually steady at for this fiscal year ended march  versus for the fiscal year ended march  management is continuing efforts to improve commission retention rates by refining our business model to emphasize the recruitment and retention of sophisticated representatives 
these individuals can offer a variety of brokerage and advisory products and services that result in us better commission retention rates than those obtained from mutual funds and variable annuities 
we experienced higher margins from trading as a result of ticket charges and fees pertaining to increases in account balances that flow entirely to the profit margin 
from advisory services we receive fees on the asset balance in the account that go directly to the firm 
refer to the revenue recognition policy 
operating expenses operating expenses  which experienced a million or increase for the year ended march   are discussed in detail below compensation and benefits 
the largest component of operating expenses is compensation and benefits which increased by million or during the current period 
this is substantially below the absolute and percentage growth rates achieved in revenues and gross margins 
this change includes primarily an increase in general salaries of million offset by a decrease in officer s salary of 
million primarily as a result of the resignation of epa s president during our fiscal quarter ended june  there was also a million decrease in stock option compensation due to a reduction in the value of stock options distributed based on the black scholes method of option valuation for the comparative years ended march  versus march  the company sustained a million increase in compensation expenses from k contributions  health insurance and payroll taxes in the current period versus the prior period 
this increase along with the increase in general salaries primarily was the result of the hiring of additional personnel 
the company went from having full time employees at march  to full time employees at march  to support continued growth of the company 
there was a million increase in additional personnel expense that was needed to support the increase in business from the trading and operations sector 
resources were committed to ensure that the company continues to provide quality customer service to our sophisticated representative force 
also  million of addition expense was incurred in connection with the hiring of additional personnel in the area of compliance 
resources were devoted in this area to meet the growing needs within the industry of providing an adequate framework of internal control  quality supervision and continuing education to our independent representative force 
regulatory  legal and professional 
regulatory  legal and professional expenses increased by million or 
the largest component of this increase was a million or increase in non in house legal fees  million of which was incurred in connection with the massachusetts proceedings described in detail in part i  item legal proceedings 
an additional million of this increase arose from other actions that management believes  with advice of counsel  are of the exposures likely to be presented by our ongoing operations 
there were million in legal settlements from dealings unrelated to our brokerage business that contributed to the million increase in lawsuit settlement expenses 
we also experienced a million dollar increase in lawsuit settlements arising from transactions conducted in the normal course of business 
we increased our accruals for legal expenses from million for the prior period to million for the current period 
please refer to footnote to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  since we operate in an industry embedded with regulation  we will continue to invest significant resources to reduce the likelihood of future litigation by promoting accuracy  ensuring sound operational techniques and providing appropriate compliance measures 
finally  we experienced a million increase in accounting expenses  primarily audit related  while regulatory and professional expenses remained essentially flat for the comparative periods 
advertisement and marketing 
advertising expenses increased overall by million or due to a change in the overall marketing approach in our recruitment process 
management determined that it was more effective to communicate to a potential representative force with general marketing materials 
as a result of this marketing strategy  general marketing expenses increased by million offset by a million decline in advertising expenses magazines  brochures 
also there was million dollar increase in meals and entertainment as a result of the company continuing to meet potential representatives 
communications 
communications expenses increased by million or  primarily due to increases in printing and web site expenses approximating million and million  respectively 
these costs were incurred to target new revenue streams by providing access to information through the internet and other publications 
communication efforts and related expenses  which also include investor public relations  conference  and telephone  have historically been positively correlated with the overall growth of our business 
our web site and newsletter the capitalist have become effective medium to communicate to potential qualified representatives for recruitment purposes 
occupancy 
occupancy expenses increased by million or primarily as a result from million in added costs for rent and condominium fees and a million increase in depreciation 
in the current period we added two new investment centers in braintree  massachusetts and new york  new york 
we acquired additional fixed assets in new computers for the additional staff  leasehold improvements and additional furniture and fixtures to the home office in lynnfield  massachusetts to accommodate the increase in number of employees 
other administrative 
other administrative expenses  which include various insurance  postage  office and computer related expenses  decreased by million or 
the company experienced a million increase in office expenses related primarily to the opening of a new recruitment office in miami  florida and the cost of a full year of operations for our los angeles  california recruitment office 
increases in other administrative expenses also included million of additional office supply expense  a million increase in bank charges resulting from a heavy volume credit card transactions to process representative license renewals  a million increase in other taxes due to the prior year s adjustment regarding sales and use tax  and a million increase in charitable donations 
offsetting those increases  computer maintenance services declined by million reflecting a greater reliance on in house staff to service our computer systems and maintain our web site 
postage decreased by million as a result of paying commissions through electronic funds transmission eft and providing commission reports to our representatives over our web site versus mailing out their check and commission statement 
also  the company utilized the united states post office for overnight deliveries  which is less expensive than other parcel couriers 
other declines in office related expenses were from mutual fund expenses which experienced a million decline due to the termination of the management agreement for the mutual funds  and a million decline in bad debt expenses from the write off of bad debt related to loans extended to our representatives 
no loans were written off during the fiscal year ended march operating income operating income decreased by million or due to an increase in operating expenses of 
the most significant contributors to the increase in operating expenses were million in legal fees in the massachusetts proceedings and an additional million in legal fees and settlements incurred in other legal proceedings that the company believes in the aggregate will prove to be atypically heavy when compared with legal related expenses incurred in the course of future operations 
we will continue to make substantial investments in our selling and administrative services capabilities  including additions to management  personnel and service infrastructure  as part of a concerted strategy to increase revenues and profitability 
management firmly believes that a sustained focus on enhancing our state of the art business platform will facilitate accelerated recruitment of independent representatives that are focused on growing revenues  particularly in high margin lines such as advisory and trading services 
as part of this effort  the company continues to invest in an automated trading system that enables sophisticated representatives to enhance client base and activity 
net income net income decreased by approximately million or  or per basic and per diluted share  due to a decrease in operating income and a related increase in the provision for income taxes due to deferred tax items 
the decrease in operating income is a result of incurring more operating expenses  primarily legal expenses  proportionate to the increase in revenues and profit margins compared to the fiscal year ended march  in partial offset  we experienced a million gain on the sale of an asset during the current period 
see footnote to our consolidated financial statements 
there was no such gain in the prior period  however  there was a million dollar loss on early disposal of computer equipment 
fiscal year ended march  compared with fiscal year ended march  revenues revenues increased for fiscal year versus the company still managed growth over the comparative year although overall market conditions negatively affected the industry 
the presidential election  the war in iraq  rising energy costs  and a potential increase in interest rates created skepticism within the financial service sector  however  the company  through it s recruiting process  continued to attract sophisticated representatives who offered a broad and diversified product base to clients 
as a result  the company was able to obtain an increase in overall sales even during difficult market conditions

on the other hand  sales from trading  as a percentage of revenue  increased from to compared to the prior year  and advisory services sales  as a percentage of revenue  increased from to 
by recruiting representatives who are licensed to sell a variety of investments that meet the needs of their clients  we achieved a significant shift of sales towards higher margin products 
this contributed to an increase in the overall profit margin 
the gross margin table illustrates that sales in mutual funds and variable annuities generated on average a margin retention during fiscal years ended and  whereas sales from trading produced profit margin retentions of and for fiscal years ended and respectively

gross margin contribution from trading declined to million in fiscal year ended as the result of several factors 
in fiscal year we had a net trading error of approximately million 
in addition  a number of our representatives increased sales through our online trading platform 
these representatives tend to execute fewer  but higher volume  trades than our other representatives  resulting in less ticket revenue for the company 
also  these representatives generally command a higher payout 
in light of the increases in trading sales volume and assets under management  we will continue to focus our attention on recruiting high level and experienced representatives to improve our overall profit margin and at the same time meet the financial needs of our clients 
payouts to representatives payouts to representatives in commissions  advisory  and other fees have held steadily at approximately of sales for the comparative fiscal years and management continually monitors and adjusts its payout structure accordingly 
operating expenses advertising 
advertising expenses increased by approximately over the previous year due to added marketing efforts that are necessary to promote the company and enhance its brand name recognition 
the national presence of the company has demanded a wider scope of advertising 
additionally  travel and its associated costs have been required in order to support our marketing efforts 
communications 
communications expenses increased by approximately over the prior year due to costs in the areas of printing  investor public relations  web site infrastructure  conferences  and telephone 
these expenses are heavily correlated with growth in the company and its overall business activity 
compensation and benefits 
compensation and benefits expenses increased by over the prior year due to our commitment to place individuals with strong industry expertise into positions of leadership where essential decisions can be formed 
on an overall basis  additional compensation benefits allow the company to grow and provide better service 
regulatory  legal and professional 
regulatory  legal and professional expenses increased by approximately over fiscal year with the growth in our broker dealer  advisory  and asset management business  and the associated regulatory scrutiny commonplace in the industry  the company had increased its utilization of professional services 
the company remitted full payment during on a sizeable liability related to regulatory matters  thus fully satisfying its related obligations 
the overall current market risk of the industry is a factor that remains uncertain 
management believes that costs related to regulatory  legal and professional activities can be stabilized in the future under an improved overall investment environment and increasingly effective risk management 
occupancy 
occupancy expenses had increased by approximately from the prior year mainly due to increases in rent and depreciation of fixed assets 
as the company continues to expand  additional fixed asset expenditures may be required 
other administrative 
other administrative expenses decreased by approximately over the past year  demonstrating that the company is controlling operating expenses related to company wide items 
the other administrative expense categories include various insurance items  postage  office expenses  and computer maintenance 
operating income operating income declined from million  or of revenues  to million  or of revenues  compared to in fiscal year march  versus fiscal year march  we made a substantial financial commitment to acquire seasoned personnel  including senior management with extensive and responsible industry expertise  in an effort to increase sales  particularly by restructuring the company s product mix to emphasize the advisory services sector 
management s efforts were to continue to refine the business model  particular regarding recruitment of key personnel and quality producing representatives with the view of growing the high margin advisory services sector and trading or brokerage sector and improving operating income and earnings per share 
net income in comparative fiscal years and  net income decreased by approximately million  or per basic share and per diluted share 
in an ever changing and increasingly competitive environment  our long term plan is to increase net income and earnings per share on a sustainable basis 
key to this effort will be to continue attracting and servicing high quality  professional representatives who will enable us to efficiently exploit our market niche  grow assets under management  and increase our overall profitability 
liquidity and capital resources the company believes that achieving its return on equity goals requires the efficient use of capital 
we have financed our operations primarily with internally generated cash flow 
cash inflows historically come mainly from the profitability of the company s core services and investment products 
for the last several years  profitability has typically followed an annual cycle of relatively average profitability during the first and third fiscal quarters  relatively low profitability during the second fiscal quarter when several representatives and their clients are on summer vacation  and relatively high profitability during the fourth fiscal quarter when several representatives and their clients start a new business and investment year 
in addition to the annual profitability cycle  uncertainty in the financial markets can have a negative impact on cash flow 
the company works to minimize this impact by aggressively recruiting sophisticated representatives who can offer diversified products that continue to meet the needs of their clients  despite changing market conditions 
the company takes a proactive approach to minimizing  if not preventing  the occurrence of other events that may lead to unexpected cash outflows  including lawsuits  trade errors and fines from regulatory agencies such as the nasd or the sec 
a key to this approach is ensuring that adequate controls over our operations and those of our representatives are implemented and periodically updated 
as part of this effort  substantial resources have been committed to enhancing the capabilities of our compliance team members  whose tasks include assuring that our representatives give proper weight to the circumstances and interests of their clients when recommending investment options 
the company also allocates resources to stay current with the many rules and regulations applicable to our business by assisting in the education and training of our sales representatives and staff 
as of march   cash and cash equivalents totaled million as compared to million as of march  working capital as of march  was million as compared to million as of march  the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was to as of march  as compared to to as of march  operations provided million in cash for the year ended march  as compared to providing million cash for year ended march  cash flow from operations in comparing the current period to the prior period decreased by million as a result of several factors 
we experienced a million decrease in net income 
we had a cash flow decrease of million from our trade receivables and a million decrease in accounts receivable asset held for sale 
offsetting this decrease was a million cash flow increase from income taxes  a million decrease from current payables in accounts payable and accrued expenses and a million increase resulting from commission payables 
cash outflows from investing activities for the current period comprised million of which million was for purchasing equipment as well as technology and leasehold improvements 
million was used to grant loans to registered representatives to help grow their businesses 
also  we had a million cash outflow for an investment through a private placement 
finally  from financing activities we paid a million cash dividend on may  to shareholders of record as of may   offset by million received in financing debt for our insurance premiums 
cash disbursements contributing significantly to year end cash outflows during our most recent quarter included million for legal related matters 
also  we had million in cash disbursements for payment to our errors and omissions insurance carrier offset by million for insurance premium collections 
management anticipates that the current period net cash outflows for legal are not indicative of a future cash outflow trend but  rather  reflected payment on an atypical lawsuit that was not covered by our insurance policy and for legal fees paid to defend against the massachusetts proceedings 
however  those disbursements during the current quarter did have a significant impact on our brokerage firm s net capital ratio 
the sec uniform net capital rule rule c requires that icc  our broker dealer subsidiary  maintain net capital of  and a ratio of aggregate indebtedness to net capital a net capital ratio not to exceed to under the rule  indebtedness generally includes all money owed by a company  and net capital includes cash and assets that are easily converted into cash 
sec rules also prohibit equity capital which  under the net capital rule  includes subordinated loans from being withdrawn  cash dividends from being paid and other specified actions of similar effect from being taken  if  among other specified contingencies  the company s net capital ratio would exceed to or if we would have less than of our minimum required net capital 
as of march   icc had net capital of million ie  an excess of million and a to net capital ratio as compared to net capital of approximately million ie  an excess of million and a to net capital ratio as of march  the company s legal accrual increased to million from million as a result of the massachusetts proceedings 
during the current period the increase in our legal accrual had impacted icc s net capital ratio and excess net capital 
the company does not consider this to be a trend and does not currently anticipate that similar accrual increases will be a recurring necessity 
see footnote to our consolidated financial statements 
the company currently has ample cash to cover additional accruals and disbursements resulting from these proceedings 
despite these legal proceedings  that increased our legal accrual  the company remains focused on committing their resources necessary for continued growth 
in its role as investment advisor to the eastern point advisors funds trust family of mutual funds  company disbursements to pay fund expenses that exceed their respective ceiling caps averaged million per quarter during the duration of this current fiscal year 
as previously noted  the company agreed to terminate its management contract with the trust and  accordingly  the company received a relative cash flow infusion of million for the year ended march  versus a million cash flow outlay for the year ended march  see footnote to our consolidated financial statements 
by comparison  for the year ended march   cash inflows primarily came from net income  which contributed million as well as the collection of million of accounts receivable and million from current liabilities in accrued expenses and accounts payable 
cash outflows included million for payment of taxes  million for payment of commissions 
from investing activities we had cash outflows of million for equipment and technology and million in loans to representatives to help them grow their business 
from financing activities we received cash inflows of million from the issuance of stock to employees and exercise of stock options 
finally we had a cash outflow of million to the nasd to pay a note in full 
icc made a business decision in fiscal year ending march  to conclude an nasd investigation into supervisory procedures relating to the period of january of through july of while we considered disputing the allegations in a formal proceeding  we estimated the cost of doing so to be prohibitive 
furthermore  we sought to avoid disruption of our operations 
accordingly  while neither admitting nor denying the allegations  we consented to a number of findings in order to resolve the matter in its initial stages 
repayment of the resulting settlement note to nasd did not have a material effect on cash flow at any time during the current period as the note was fully paid on august  the company has implemented and maintains an adequate system of supervisory and regulatory procedures and does not foresee any material deficiencies in the future in this regard 
during fiscal year ended march  cash and cash equivalents increased by million primarily from million in net income 
other operating activity items contributing to this increase were a million increase in cash flows from income taxes and a million cash flow increase from commission payable offset by a million decrease in accounts receivable related items primarily from trade blotter 
we had cash outflow items in investing activities from purchases of equipment totaling million
