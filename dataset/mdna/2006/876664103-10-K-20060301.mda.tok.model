item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a 
the shopping center business there are several types of retail shopping centers  varying primarily by size and marketing strategy 
retail shopping centers range from neighborhood centers of less than  square feet of gla to regional and super regional shopping centers 
retail shopping centers in excess of  square feet of gla are generally referred to as regional shopping centers  while those centers having in excess of  square feet of gla are generally referred to as super regional shopping centers 
nineteen of our centers are super regional centers 
in this annual report on form k  the term regional shopping centers refers to both regional and super regional shopping centers 
the term gla refers to gross retail space  including anchors and mall tenant areas  and the term mall gla refers to gross retail space  excluding anchors 
the term anchor refers to a department store or other large retail store 
the term mall tenants refers to stores other than anchors that are typically specialty retailers and lease space in shopping centers 
business of the company we  as managing general partner of the operating partnership  are engaged in the ownership  management  leasing  acquisition  development  and expansion of regional shopping centers 
the centers o are strategically located in major metropolitan areas  many in communities that are among the most affluent in the country  including charlotte  dallas  denver  detroit  los angeles  miami  new york city  orlando  phoenix  san francisco  tampa  and washington  dc  o range in size between  and million square feet of gla and between  and  square feet of mall gla 
the smallest center has approximately stores  and the largest has over stores 
of the centers  are super regional shopping centers  o have approximately  stores operated by their mall tenants under approximately  trade names  o have anchors  operating under trade names  o lease most of mall gla to national chains  including subsidiaries or divisions of the limited the limited  express  victoria s secret  and others  gap gap  gap kids  banana republic  old navy  and others  and foot locker  inc foot locker  lady foot locker  champs sports  and others  and o are among the most productive measured by mall tenants average per square foot sales in the united states 
in  mall tenants had average per square foot sales of  which is significantly greater than the average for all regional shopping centers owned by public companies 
the most important factor affecting the revenues generated by the centers is leasing to mall tenants primarily specialty retailers  which represents approximately of revenues 
anchors account for less than of revenues because many own their stores and  in general  those that lease their stores do so at rates substantially lower than those in effect for mall tenants 
our portfolio is concentrated in highly productive super regional shopping centers 
of the centers  had annual rent rolls at december  of over million 
we believe that this level of productivity is indicative of the centers strong competitive position and is  in significant part  attributable to our business strategy and philosophy 
we believe that large shopping centers including regional and especially super regional shopping centers are the least susceptible to direct competition because among other reasons anchors and large specialty retail stores do not find it economically attractive to open additional stores in the immediate vicinity of an existing location for fear of competing with themselves 
in addition to the advantage of size  we believe that the centers success can be attributed in part to their other physical characteristics  such as design  layout  and amenities 
business strategy and philosophy we believe that the regional shopping center business is not simply a real estate development business  but rather an operating business in which a retailing approach to the on going management and leasing of the centers is essential 
thus we o offer a large  diverse selection of retail stores in each center to give customers a broad selection of consumer goods and variety of price ranges  o endeavor to increase overall mall tenants sales by leasing space to a constantly changing mix of tenants  thereby increasing achievable rents  o seek to anticipate trends in the retailing industry and emphasize ongoing introductions of new retail concepts into our centers 
due in part to this strategy  a number of successful retail trade names have opened their first mall stores in the centers 
in addition  we have brought to the centers new to the market retailers 
we believe that the execution of this leasing strategy has been unique in the industry and is an important element in building and maintaining customer loyalty and increasing mall productivity  and o provide innovative initiatives that utilize technology and the internet to heighten the shopping experience  build customer loyalty and increase tenant sales 
our taubman center website program connects shoppers and retailers through an interactive content driven website 
we also offer our shoppers a robust direct email program  which allows them to receive  each week  information featuring what s on sale and what s new at the stores they select 
the centers compete for retail consumer spending through diverse  in depth presentations of predominantly fashion merchandise in an environment intended to facilitate customer shopping 
while some centers include stores that target high end  upscale customers  each center is individually merchandised in light of the demographics of its potential customers within convenient driving distance 
our leasing strategy involves assembling a diverse mix of mall tenants in each of the centers in order to attract customers  thereby generating higher sales by mall tenants 
high sales by mall tenants make the centers attractive to prospective tenants  thereby increasing the rental rates that prospective tenants are willing to pay 
we implement an active leasing strategy to increase the centers productivity and to set minimum rents at higher levels 
elements of this strategy include terminating leases of under performing tenants  renegotiating existing leases  and not leasing space to prospective tenants that though viable or attractive in certain ways would not enhance a center s retail mix 
in  we began a new leasing strategy which offers our tenants the option to pay a fixed charge or pay their share of common area maintenance cam costs 
we believe that this will be positive for tenant relations  as it will allow the retailer to decide whether fixed cam or traditional net cam works best for them 
our research suggests this approach is unique in the industry  the retailer can choose greater predictability for a modest premium in the fixed cam option 
from a financial perspective  our analysis shows the premium will balance our additional risk 
as tenants sign up for the fixed cam option  over time there will be significantly less matching of cam income with cam expenditures  which can vary considerably from period to period 
potential for growth our principal objective is to enhance shareholder value 
we seek to maximize the financial results of our core assets  while also pursuing a growth strategy that primarily includes an active new center development program 
internal growth we expect that the majority of our future growth will come from our existing core portfolio and business 
although we ve always had a culture of intensively managing our assets and maximizing the rents from tenants  we re committed to improving the processes that significantly impact the core portfolio in order to drive even better performance 
our core business strategy is to maintain a portfolio of properties that deliver above market profitable growth by providing targeted retailers with the best opportunity to do business in each market and targeted shoppers with the best local shopping experience for their needs 
development of new centers we are pursuing an active program of regional shopping center development 
we believe that we have the expertise to develop economically attractive regional shopping centers through intensive analysis of local retail opportunities 
we believe that the development of new centers is an important use of our capital and an area in which we excel 
at any time  we have numerous potential development projects in various stages 
in october  we announced plans for the development of the mall at partridge creek  a wholly owned retail project in clinton township  michigan 
groundbreaking on the  square foot center occurred during november and the center is expected to open in fall  with nordstrom opening in spring the center will be anchored by nordstrom  parisian  and mjr theatres 
our approximately million balance of development pre construction costs as of december  consists of costs relating to the oyster bay project in the town of oyster bay  new york 
refer to management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources planned capital spending regarding the status of this project 
northlake mall  a wholly owned regional center  opened on september  in charlotte  north carolina 
the million square foot center is anchored by belk  dick s sporting goods  dillard s  hecht s  and amc theatres 
in april  we announced the formation of taubman asia  which will be the platform for our future expansion into the asia pacific region 
taubman asia is headquartered in hong kong and will seek projects that leverage our strong retail planning  design and operational capabilities 
we are currently evaluating opportunities in the region and are analyzing selected projects in the major asian markets 
in january  we entered into an agreement to invest in the pier at caesars the pier  located in atlantic city  new jersey  with gordon group holdings llc gordon  which is developing the center 
the pier is currently under construction  and is expected to open in may our policies with respect to development activities are designed to reduce the risks associated with development 
we generally do not intend to acquire land early in the development process 
instead  we generally acquire options on land or form partnerships with landholders holding potentially attractive development sites 
we typically exercise the options only once we are prepared to begin construction 
the pre construction phase for a regional center typically extends over several years and the time to obtain anchor commitments  zoning and regulatory approvals  and public financing arrangements can vary significantly from project to project 
in addition  we do not intend to begin construction until a sufficient number of anchor stores have agreed to operate in the shopping center  such that we are confident that the projected sales and rents from mall gla are sufficient to earn a return on invested capital in excess of our cost of capital 
having historically followed these principles  our experience indicates that  on average  less than of the costs of the development of a regional shopping center will be incurred prior to the construction period 
however  no assurance can be given that we will continue to be able to so limit pre construction costs 
unexpected costs due to extended zoning and regulatory processes may cause our investment in a project to exceed this historic experience 
while we will continue to evaluate development projects using criteria  including financial criteria for rates of return  similar to those employed in the past  no assurances can be given that the adherence to these policies will produce comparable results in the future 
in addition  the costs of shopping center development opportunities that are explored but ultimately abandoned will  to some extent  diminish the overall return on development projects 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources capital spending for further discussion of our development activities 
strategic acquisitions our objective is to acquire existing centers only when they are compatible with the quality of our portfolio or can be redeveloped to that level and that satisfy our strategic plans and pricing requirements 
we also may acquire additional interests in centers currently in our portfolio 
in we acquired an additional interest in international plaza  bringing our ownership in the shopping center to  and the additional ownership of beverly center  bringing our ownership in the shopping center to 
expansions of the centers another potential element of growth is the strategic expansion of existing properties to update and enhance their market positions  by replacing or adding new anchor stores or increasing mall tenant space 
most of the centers have been designed to accommodate expansions 
expansion projects can be as significant as new shopping center construction in terms of scope and cost  requiring governmental and existing anchor store approvals  design and engineering activities  including rerouting utilities  providing additional parking areas or decking  acquiring additional land  and relocating anchors and mall tenants all of which must take place with a minimum of disruption to existing tenants and customers 
construction is underway on an expansion and renovation at waterside shops at pelican bay  which will increase the size of the center to  square feet 
the tenants will begin opening in stages in in addition  nordstrom will join the center as an anchor in and an expansion of the current anchor  saks fifth avenue  will be completed in late or early construction at twelve oaks mall will begin early in with the addition of a  square foot nordstrom  a  square foot expansion and renovation of marshall field s  and approximately  square feet of additional new store space 
in january we closed on the purchase of the filene s store at stamford town center 
demolition of the building is expected to begin in the first quarter of and we are currently finalizing our plans for new restaurant and retail space

in december  a interest in the center was acquired 
in july  an additional interest in the center was acquired 
in march  the joint venture partner s interest in the center was acquired 
rental rates as leases have expired in the centers  we have generally been able to rent the available space  either to the existing tenant or a new tenant  at rental rates that are higher than those of the expired leases 
in periods of increasing sales  such as those we are currently experiencing  rents on new leases will tend to rise as tenants expectations of future growth become more optimistic 
in periods of slower growth or declining sales  rents on new leases will grow more slowly or will decline for the opposite reason 
however  center revenues nevertheless increase as older leases roll over or are terminated early and replaced with new leases negotiated at current rental rates that are usually higher than the average rates for existing leases 
the following tables contain certain information regarding per square foot minimum rent in our consolidated businesses and unconsolidated joint ventures at the comparable centers centers that had been owned and open for the current and preceding year average rent per square foot consolidated businesses unconsolidated joint ventures opening base rent per square foot consolidated businesses unconsolidated joint ventures square feet of gla opened consolidated businesses      unconsolidated joint ventures     closing base rent per square foot consolidated businesses unconsolidated joint ventures square feet of gla closed consolidated businesses      unconsolidated joint ventures     releasing spread per square foot consolidated businesses unconsolidated joint ventures the spread between opening and closing rents may not be indicative of future periods  as this statistic is not computed on comparable tenant spaces  and can vary significantly from period to period depending on the total amount  location  and average size of tenant space opening and closing in the period 
lease expirations the following table shows lease expirations based on information available as of december  for the next ten years for all owned centers in operation at that date lease expiration year number of leases expiring leased area in square footage annualized base rent under expiring leases in thousands of dollars annualized base rent under expiring leases per square foot percent of total leased square footage represented by expiring leases excludes leases that expire in for which renewal leases or leases with replacement tenants have been executed as of december  we believe that the information in the table is not necessarily indicative of what will occur in the future because of several factors  but principally because of early lease terminations at the centers 
for example  the average remaining term of the leases that were terminated during the period to was approximately two years 
the average term of leases signed during and was approximately seven years 
in addition  mall tenants at the centers may seek the protection of the bankruptcy laws  which could result in the termination of such tenants leases and thus cause a reduction in cash flow 
in we experienced the lowest percentage in our history at of leases affected compared to in this statistic has ranged from to since we went public in since  the annual provision for losses on accounts receivable has been less than of annual revenues 
occupancy mall tenant leased space  ending occupancy  and average occupancy rates of our centers were  and  respectively  in  and   and  respectively  in for comparable centers  leased space  ending occupancy  and average occupancy rates were   and  respectively  in  and   and  respectively  in occupancy statistics include centers owned and open in the full periods presented  and value center anchors 
the statistics for comparable centers exclude northlake  which opened in and woodland  which was sold in the fourth quarter of major tenants no single retail company represents or more of our revenues 
the combined operations of the limited  inc accounted for approximately of mall gla as of december  and of minimum rent 
no other single retail company accounted for more than of mall gla or of minimum rent

general risks of the company the economic performance and value of our shopping centers are dependent on many factors the economic performance and value of our shopping centers are dependent on various factors 
additionally  these same factors will influence our decision whether to go forward on the development of new centers and may affect the ultimate economic performance and value of projects under construction 
adverse changes in the economic performance and value of our shopping centers would adversely affect our income and cash available to pay dividends 
such factors include o changes in the national  regional  and or local economic and geopolitical climates  o increases in operating costs  o the public perception of the safety of customers at our shopping centers  o legal liabilities  o availability and cost of financing  o changes in government regulations  and o changes in real estate zoning and tax laws 
in addition  the value and performance of our shopping centers may be adversely affected by certain other factors discussed below including competition  uninsured losses  and environmental liabilities 
we are in a competitive business 
there are numerous shopping facilities that compete with our properties in attracting retailers to lease space 
in addition  retailers at our properties face continued competition from discount shopping centers  lifestyle centers  outlet malls  wholesale and discount shopping clubs  direct mail  telemarketing  television shopping networks and shopping via the internet 
competition of this type could adversely affect our revenues and cash available for distribution to stockholders 
we compete with other major real estate investors with significant capital for attractive investment opportunities 
these competitors include other reits  investment banking firms and private institutional investors 
this competition has increased prices for commercial properties and may impair our ability to make suitable property acquisitions on favorable terms in the future 
some of our potential losses may not be covered by insurance 
we carry comprehensive liability  fire  flood  earthquake  extended coverage and rental loss insurance on each of our properties 
we believe the policy specifications and insured limits of these policies are adequate and appropriate 
there are  however  some types of losses  including lease and other contract claims  that generally are not insured 
if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs  we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property  as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property 
if this happens  we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property 
in november  congress passed the terrorism risk insurance act of tria  which required insurance companies to offer terrorism coverage to all existing insured companies for an additional cost 
as a result  our standard property insurance policies are currently provided without a sub limit for terrorism  eliminating the need for separate terrorism insurance policies 
in  congress extended the expiration date of tria to december  while congress may further extend or replace tria  the possibility exists that tria may be allowed to expire at the end of there are specific provisions in our loans that address terrorism insurance 
simply stated  in most loans  we are obligated to obtain terrorism insurance  but there are limits on the amounts we could be required to spend to obtain such coverage 
if congress fails to further extend or replace tria or if another terrorist event occurs  we would likely pay higher amounts for terrorism insurance coverage and or obtain less coverage than we have currently 
our inability to obtain such coverage or to do so only at greatly increased costs may also negatively impact the availability and cost of future financings 
we may be subject to liabilities for environmental matters 
all of the centers presently owned by us not including option interests in certain pre development projects have been subject to environmental assessments 
no assurances can be given  however  that all environmental liabilities have been identified or that no prior owner  operator  or current occupant has created an environmental condition not known to us 
moreover  no assurances can be given that future laws  ordinances or regulations will not impose any material environmental liability or that the current environmental condition of the centers will not be affected by tenants and occupants of the centers  by the condition of properties in the vicinity of the centers such as the presence of underground storage tanks or by third parties unrelated to us 
we hold investments in joint ventures in which we do not control all decisions  and we may have conflicts of interest with our joint venture partners 
some of our shopping centers are partially owned by non affiliated partners through joint venture arrangements 
as a result  we do not control all decisions regarding those shopping centers and may be required to take actions that are in the interest of the joint venture partners but not our best interests 
accordingly  we may not be able to favorably resolve any issues which arise with respect to such decisions  or we may have to provide financial or other inducements to our joint venture partners to obtain such resolution 
various restrictive provisions and rights govern sales or transfers of interests in our joint ventures 
these may work to our disadvantage because  among other things  we may be required to make decisions as to the purchase or sale of interests in our joint ventures at a time that is disadvantageous to us 
the bankruptcy of our tenants  anchors or joint venture partners could adversely affect us 
we could be adversely affected by the bankruptcy of third parties 
the bankruptcy of a mall tenant could result in the termination of its lease which would lower the amount of cash generated by that mall 
in addition  if a department store operating as an anchor at one of our shopping centers were to go into bankruptcy and cease operating  we may experience difficulty and delay in replacing the anchor 
in addition  the anchor s closing may lead to reduced customer traffic and lower mall tenant sales 
as a result  we may also experience difficulty or delay in leasing spaces in areas adjacent to the vacant anchor space 
the profitability of shopping centers held in a joint venture could also be adversely affected by the bankruptcy of one of the joint venture partners if  because of certain provisions of the bankruptcy laws  we were unable to make important decisions in a timely fashion or became subject to additional liabilities 
our investments are subject to credit and market risk 
we occasionally extend credit to third parties in connection with the sale of land or other transactions 
we have occasionally made investments in marketable and other equity securities 
we are exposed to risk in the event the values of our investments and or our loans decrease due to overall market conditions  business failure  and or other nonperformance by the investees or counterparties 
our real estate investments are relatively illiquid 
we may be limited in our ability to vary our portfolio in response to changes in economic or other conditions by restriction on transfer imposed by our partners or lenders 
in addition  under trg s partnership agreement  upon the sale of a center or trg s interest in a center  trg may be required to distribute to its partners all of the cash proceeds received by trg from such sale 
if trg made such a distribution  the sale proceeds would not be available to finance trg s activities  and the sale of a center may result in a decrease in funds generated by continuing operations and in distributions to trg s partners  including us 
we may acquire or develop new properties  and these activities are subject to various risks 
we actively pursue development and acquisition activities as opportunities arise  and these activities are subject to the following risks o the pre construction phase for a regional center typically extends over several years  and the time to obtain anchor commitments  zoning and regulatory approvals  and public financing can vary significantly from project to project  o we may not be able to obtain the necessary zoning or other governmental approvals for a project  or we may determine that the expected return on a project is not sufficient  if we abandon our development activities with respect to a particular project  we may incur a loss on our investment  o construction and other project costs may exceed our original estimates because of increases in material and labor costs  delays and costs to obtain anchor and tenant commitments  o we may not be able to obtain financing or to refinance construction loans  which are generally recourse to trg  and o occupancy rates and rents at a completed project may not meet our projections  and the costs of development activities that we explore but ultimately abandon will  to some extent  diminish the overall return on our completed development projects 
we are currently exploring development and acquisition opportunities in international markets 
in addition to the risks noted above we may have additional currency  funds repatriation  tax and other political and regulatory considerations associated with such projects that may reduce our financial return 
we may not be able to maintain our status as a reit 
we may not be able to maintain our status as a reit for federal income tax purposes with the result that the income distributed to shareholders will not be deductible in computing taxable income and instead would be subject to tax at regular corporate rates 
we may also be subject to the alternative minimum tax if we fail to maintain our status as a reit 
any such corporate tax liability would be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our shareholders which  in turn  could have a material adverse impact on the value of  or trading price for  our shares 
although we believe we are organized and operate in a manner to maintain our reit qualification  many of the reit requirements of the internal revenue code of  as amended  or the code  are very complex and have limited judicial or administrative interpretations 
changes in tax laws or regulations or new administrative interpretations and court decisions may also affect our ability to maintain reit status in the future 
if we do not maintain our reit status in any year  we may be unable to elect to be treated as a reit for the next four taxable years 
although we currently intend to maintain our status as a reit  future economic  market  legal  tax  or other considerations may cause us to determine that it would be in our and our shareholders best interests to revoke our reit election 
if we revoke our reit election  we will not be able to elect reit status for the next four taxable years 
we may be subject to taxes even if we qualify as a reit 
even if we qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes  we will be required to pay certain federal  state and local taxes on our income and property 
for example  we will be subject to income tax to the extent we distribute less than of our reit taxable income  including capital gains 
moreover  if we have net income from prohibited transactions  that income will be subject to a penalty tax 
in general  prohibited transactions are sales or other dispositions of property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business 
the determination as to whether a particular sale is a prohibited transaction depends on the facts and circumstances related to that sale 
we cannot guarantee that sales of our properties would not be prohibited transactions unless we comply with certain statutory safe harbor provisions 
the need to avoid prohibited transactions could cause us to forego or defer sales of facilities that non reits otherwise would have sold or that might otherwise be in our best interest to sell 
in addition  any net taxable income earned directly by our taxable reit subsidiaries will be subject to federal and state corporate income tax 
in this regard  several provisions of the laws applicable to reits and their subsidiaries ensure that a taxable reit subsidiary will be subject to an appropriate level of federal income taxation 
for example  a taxable reit subsidiary is limited in its ability to deduct certain interest payments made to an affiliated reit 
in addition  the reit has to pay a penalty tax on some payments that it receives or on some deductions taken by the taxable reit subsidiaries if the economic arrangements between the reit  the reit s tenants  and the taxable reit subsidiary are not comparable to similar arrangements between unrelated parties 
finally  some state and local jurisdictions may tax some of our income even though as a reit we are not subject to federal income tax on that income  because not all states and localities follow the federal income tax treatment of reits 
to the extent that we and our affiliates are required to pay federal  state and local taxes  we will have less cash available for distributions to our shareholders 
the lower tax rate on certain dividends from non reit c corporations may cause investors to prefer to hold stock in non reit c corporations 
while corporate dividends have traditionally been taxed at ordinary income rates  the maximum tax rate on certain corporate dividends received by individuals through december   has been reduced from to 
this change has reduced substantially the so called double taxation that is  taxation at both the corporate and shareholder levels that had generally applied to non reit c corporations but did not apply to reits 
generally  dividends from reits do not qualify for the dividend tax reduction because reits generally do not pay corporate level tax on income that they distribute currently to shareholders 
reit dividends are only eligible for the lower capital gains rates in limited circumstances where the dividends are attributable to income  such as dividends from a taxable reit subsidiary  that has been subject to corporate level tax 
the application of capital gains rates to non reit c corporation dividends could cause individual investors to view stock in non reit c corporations as more attractive than shares in reits  which may negatively affect the value of our shares 
our ownership limitations and other provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws may hinder any attempt to acquire us 
the general limitations on ownership of our capital stock and other provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws could have the effect of discouraging offers to acquire us and of inhibiting a change in control  which could adversely affect our shareholders ability to receive a premium for their shares in connection with such a transaction 
members of the taubman family have the power to vote a significant number of the shares of our capital stock entitled to vote 
based on information contained in filings made with the sec  as of december   a 
alfred taubman and the members of his family have the power to vote approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock and our series b preferred stock  considered together as a single class  and approximately of our outstanding series b preferred stock 
our shares of common stock and our series b preferred stock vote together as a single class on all matters generally submitted to a vote of our shareholders  and the holders of the series b preferred stock have certain rights to nominate up to four individuals for election to our board of directors and other class voting rights 
mr 
taubman s sons  robert s 
taubman and william s 
taubman  serve as our chairman of the board  president and chief executive officer  and our chief operating officer  respectively 
these individuals occupy the same positions with the taubman company  llc  which manages all of our properties 
as a result  mr

alfred taubman and the members of his family may exercise significant influence with respect to the election of our board of directors  the outcome of any corporate transaction or other matter submitted to our shareholders for approval  including any merger  consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets 
in addition  because our articles of incorporation impose a limitation on the ownership of our outstanding capital stock by any person and such ownership limitation may not be changed without the affirmative vote of holders owning not less than two thirds of the outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote on such matter  mr 
a 
alfred taubman and the members of his family have the power to prevent a change in control of our company 
our ability to pay dividends on our stock may be limited 
because we conduct all of our operations through trg  our ability to pay dividends on our stock will depend almost entirely on payments and dividends received on our interests in trg 
additionally  the terms of some of the debt to which trg is a party limits its ability to make some types of payments and other dividends to us 
this in turn limits our ability to make some types of payments  including payment of dividends on our stock  unless we meet certain financial tests or such payments or dividends are required to maintain our qualification as a reit 
as a result  if we are unable to meet the applicable financial tests  we may not be able to pay dividends on our stock in one or more periods 
our ability to pay dividends is further limited by the requirements of michigan law 
our ability to pay dividends on our stock is further limited by the laws of michigan 
under the michigan business corporation act  a michigan corporation may not make a distribution if  after giving effect to the distribution  the corporation would not be able to pay its debts as the debts become due in the usual course of business  or the corporation s total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities plus the amount that would be needed  if the corporation were dissolved at the time of the distribution  to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of shareholders whose preferential rights are superior to those receiving the distribution 
accordingly  we may not make a distribution on our stock if  after giving effect to the distribution  we would not be able to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of business or our total assets would be less than the sum of our total liabilities plus the amount that would be needed to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of the holders of any shares of our preferred stock then outstanding 
we may incur additional indebtedness  which may harm our financial position and cash flow and potentially impact our ability to pay dividends on our stock 
our governing documents do not limit us from incurring additional indebtedness and other liabilities 
as of december   we had approximately billion of consolidated indebtedness outstanding  and our beneficial interest in both our consolidated debt and the debt of our unconsolidated joint ventures was billion 
we may incur additional indebtedness and become more highly leveraged  which could harm our financial position and potentially limit our cash available to pay dividends 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to pay dividends regularly although we have done so in the past 
our ability to pay dividends in the future is dependent on our ability to operate profitably and to generate cash from our operations 
although we have done so in the past  we cannot guarantee that we will be able to pay dividends on a regular quarterly basis in the future 
furthermore  any new shares of common stock issued will substantially increase the cash required to continue to pay cash dividends at current levels 
any common stock or preferred stock that may in the future be issued to finance acquisitions  upon exercise of stock options or otherwise  would have a similar effect 
environmental matters all of the centers presently owned by us not including option interests in certain pre development projects have been subject to environmental assessments 
we are not aware of any environmental liability relating to the centers or any other property  in which we have or had an interest whether as an owner or operator that we believe  would have a material adverse effect on our business  assets  or results of operations 
no assurances can be given  however  that all environmental liabilities have been identified or that no prior owner  operator  or current occupant has created an environmental condition not known to us 
moreover  no assurances can be given that future laws  ordinances  or regulations will not impose any material environmental liability or that the current environmental condition of the centers will not be affected by tenants and occupants of the centers  by the condition of properties in the vicinity of the centers such as the presence of underground storage tanks  or by third parties unrelated to us

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains various forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
these forward looking statements represent our expectations or beliefs concerning future events  including the following statements regarding future developments and joint ventures  rents and returns  statements regarding the continuation of trends  and any statements regarding the sufficiency of our cash balances and cash generated from operating and financing activities for our future liquidity and capital resource needs 
we caution that although forward looking statements reflect our good faith beliefs and best judgment based upon current information  these statements are qualified by important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements  including those risks  uncertainties  and factors detailed from time to time in reports filed with the sec  and in particular those set forth under the headings general risks of the company and environmental matters in this annual report on form k 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements of taubman centers  inc and the notes thereto 
general background and performance measurement taubman centers  inc we  us  our or tco owns a managing general partner s interest in the taubman realty group limited partnership the operating partnership or trg  through which we conduct all of our operations 
the operating partnership owns  develops  acquires  and operates shopping centers 
the consolidated businesses consist of shopping centers that are controlled by ownership or contractual agreement  development projects for future regional shopping centers  variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary  and the taubman company llc manager 
shopping centers owned through joint ventures that are not controlled by us but over which we have significant influence unconsolidated joint ventures are accounted for under the equity method 
references in this discussion to beneficial interest refer to our ownership or pro rata share of the item being discussed 
also  the operations of the shopping centers are often best understood by measuring their performance as a whole  without regard to our ownership interest 
consequently  in addition to the discussion of the operations of the consolidated businesses  the operations of the unconsolidated joint ventures are presented and discussed as a whole 
there are a number of items that affect the comparability of information used in measuring performance 
during  we opened northlake mall and sold our interest in woodland 
during  we opened stony point fashion park  acquired an interest in waterside shops at pelican bay  and sold our interest in biltmore fashion park see results of operations openings  acquisitions  and dispositions 
additional comparable center statistics that include centers owned and open for two years are provided to present the performance of comparable centers in our continuing operations 
for and  comparable centers exclude northlake mall and woodland 
overall summary of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our business is to lease space in our shopping centers 
generally these leases are long term to years 
therefore general economic trends most directly impact our tenants sales and consequently their ability to perform under their existing lease agreements and expand into new locations as well as our ability to find new tenants for our shopping centers 
occupancy continued to increase during  and we have now reported year over year occupancy increases for six straight quarters 
we anticipate that during the first half of occupancy will be even with the first half of due to some early terminations and we expect increases in the second half of the year 
tenant sales trends demonstrated strong growth in  increasing and reaching a new record level of per square foot for our comparable centers 
this increase in sales resulted in a significant increase in percentage rent in and a decrease in our tenants occupancy costs as a percentage of sales see results of operations 
we believe these improving tenant sales provide us an opportunity to increase rents in the future 
see mall tenant sales and center revenues and rental rates and occupancy 
the rents we are able to achieve are similarly affected by economic trends and tenants expectations thereof  as described under rental rates and occupancy 
the spread between rents on openings and closings may not be indicative of future periods  as this statistic is not computed on comparable tenant spaces  and can vary significantly from quarter to quarter depending on the total amount  location  and average size of tenant space opening and closing in the period 
mall tenant sales  occupancy levels and our resulting revenues are seasonal in nature see seasonality 
our analysis of our financial results begins under results of operations 
we have been active in developing and expanding our shopping center portfolio  and we describe the most recent center openings  including northlake mall and stony point fashion park under openings  acquisitions  and dispositions 
also  over the last three years  we acquired additional interests in five centers and disposed of interests in two centers  including the disposition in december of our interest in a owned unconsolidated joint venture 
additional efforts to broaden our growth included the formation of taubman asia  which will be the platform for our future expansion into the asia pacific region 
we similarly have been very active in managing our balance sheet  completing a series of new financings and refinancings of existing debt  issuances of partnership and preferred equity  and redemptions of partners interests in trg  as well as a series of stock buybacks  as outlined under debt transactions and equity transactions 
as a result of our most recent financings  we believe we are better positioned for a rise in interest rates 
we have certain additional sources of income beyond our rental revenues and recoveries from tenants 
we disclose the operating partnership s share of these sources of income under other income 
included in this income are lease cancellation income and gains on peripheral land sales  as well as other sources of revenue derived from our shopping centers  such as parking garage and sponsorship income 
with all the preceding information as background  we have then provided insight and explanations for variances in our financial results from through under comparison of to and comparison of to 
as information useful to understanding our results  we have described the presentation of our minority interest  the recent dispositions of interests in centers  and the reasons for our use of non gaap measures such as ebitda and funds from operations ffo under presentation of operating results 
reconciliations from net income allocable to common shareowners to these measures follow the annual comparisons 
our discussion of sources and uses of capital resources under liquidity and capital resources begins with a brief overview of capital activities and transactions occurring in analysis of specific operating  investing  and financing activities is then provided in more detail 
cash flows from rents and recoveries  recent center openings  and the acquisition of an additional interest in a property provide the resources for payments of interest and other operating expenses  leasing costs  and required distributions and dividends 
proceeds from the sale of a property and the completion of a major financing have created significant liquidity to be used for the pay off of several existing loans and further investment in development properties 
specific analysis of our fixed and floating rates and periods of interest rate risk exposure is provided under beneficial interest in debt 
completing our analysis of our exposure to rates are the effects of changes in interest rates on our cash flows and fair values of debt contained under sensitivity analysis 
in conducting our business  we enter into various contractual obligations  including those for debt  capital leases for property improvements  operating leases for office space and land  purchase obligations  and other long term commitments 
detail of these obligations  including expected settlement periods  is contained under contractual obligations 
property level debt represents the largest single class of obligations 
described under loan commitments and guarantees and cash tender agreement are our significant guarantees and commitments 
development of new malls and renovation and expansion of existing malls continues to be a significant use of our capital  as described in capital spending and planned capital spending 
recent spending includes that related to the recently opened northlake mall in charlotte  north carolina  the mall at partridge creek  in clinton township  michigan  and our oyster bay project in the town of oyster bay  new york 
we have not yet received the necessary entitlement approvals to begin construction on our planned oyster bay project 
once we have received the necessary approvals we expect to finalize our anticipated costs and return on this project and set an opening date 
additional capital spending in is expected to continue for these and other projects 
dividends and distributions are also significant uses of our capital resources 
the tax status of our dividends and the factors considered when determining the amount of our dividends  including requirements arising because of our status as a reit  are described under dividends 
we increased our quarterly dividend by in the fourth quarter of our total return to our shareholders was for mall tenant sales and center revenues over the long term  the level of mall tenant sales is the single most important determinant of revenues of the shopping centers because mall tenants provide approximately of these revenues and because mall tenant sales determine the amount of rent  percentage rent  and recoverable expenses together  total occupancy costs that mall tenants can afford to pay 
however  levels of mall tenant sales can be considerably more volatile in the short run than total occupancy costs 
we believe that the ability of tenants to pay occupancy costs and earn profits over long periods of time increases as sales per square foot increase  whether through inflation or real growth in customer spending 
because most mall tenants have certain fixed expenses  the occupancy costs that they can afford to pay and still be profitable are a higher percentage of sales at higher sales per square foot 
sales directly impact the amount of percentage rents certain tenants and anchors pay 
the effects of increases or declines in sales on our operations are moderated by the relatively minor share of total rents approximately four percent in percentage rents represent 
however  a sustained trend in sales does impact  either negatively or positively  our ability to lease vacancies and negotiate rents at advantageous rates 
tenant sales trends demonstrated strong growth in  increasing and reaching a new record level of per square foot 
this increase in sales resulted in a significant increase in percentage rent in and a decrease in our tenants occupancy costs as a percentage of sales see results of operations 
we believe these improving tenant sales provide us an opportunity to increase rents in the future 
the following table summarizes occupancy costs  excluding utilities  for mall tenants as a percentage of mall tenant sales mall tenant sales in thousands of dollars   sales per square foot consolidated businesses minimum rents percentage rents expense recoveries mall tenant occupancy costs as a percentage of mall tenant sales unconsolidated joint ventures minimum rents percentage rents expense recoveries mall tenant occupancy costs as a percentage of mall tenant sales sales per square foot for and is presented for the comparable centers  including value centers excludes northlake mall and woodland 
rental rates and occupancy as leases have expired in the shopping centers  we have generally been able to rent the available space  either to the existing tenant or a new tenant  at rental rates that are higher than those of the expired leases 
in a period of increasing sales  rents on new leases will tend to rise as tenants expectations of future growth become more optimistic 
in periods of slower growth or declining sales  rents on new leases will grow more slowly or will decline for the opposite reason 
however  center revenues nevertheless increase as older leases roll over or are terminated early and replaced with new leases negotiated at current rental rates that are usually higher than the average rates for existing leases 
the following table contains certain information regarding rentals at the comparable shopping centers average rent per square foot consolidated businesses unconsolidated joint ventures opening base rent per square foot consolidated businesses unconsolidated joint ventures square feet of gla opened consolidated businesses    unconsolidated joint ventures    closing base rent per square foot consolidated businesses unconsolidated joint ventures square feet of gla closed consolidated businesses    unconsolidated joint ventures    releasing spread per square foot consolidated businesses unconsolidated joint ventures the spread between opening and closing rents may not be indicative of future periods  as this statistic is not computed on comparable tenant spaces  and can vary significantly from period to period depending on the total amount  location  and average size of tenant space opening and closing in the period 
rents on stores opening in and were generally negotiated in a decreasing sales environment 
now that sales have shown positive year over year growth for every month over the past quarters  and assuming this positive trend continues  we would expect to also see improvement in rent growth 
mall tenant leased space  ending occupancy  and average occupancy rates are as follows all centers leased space ending occupancy average occupancy comparable centers leased space ending occupancy average occupancy occupancy continued to increase during  with ending occupancy increasing to  a increase from in for our comparable centers  ending occupancy was  a increase from in we have reported year over year occupancy gains for six straight quarters 
we anticipate that during the first half of occupancy will be even with due to early terminations and expect increases in the second half of the year 
income from temporary in line tenants  which has become an integral part of our business  continues to augment our income 
temporary tenants  defined as those with lease terms less than months  are not included in occupancy or leased space statistics 
as of december   approximately of space was occupied by temporary tenants 
tenant bankruptcy filings as a percentage of the total number of tenant leases was a record low of in  compared to in  and in seasonality the regional shopping center industry is seasonal in nature  with mall tenant sales highest in the fourth quarter due to the christmas season  and with lesser  though still significant  sales fluctuations associated with the easter holiday and back to school events 
while minimum rents and recoveries are generally not subject to seasonal factors  most leases are scheduled to expire in the first quarter  and the majority of new stores open in the second half of the year in anticipation of the christmas selling season 
additionally  most percentage rents are recorded in the fourth quarter 
accordingly  revenues and occupancy levels are generally highest in the fourth quarter 
included in revenues are gains on sales of peripheral land and lease cancellation income that may vary significantly from quarter to quarter

our gain on the transaction differed from the million gain recognized by the operating partnership due to our million additional basis in woodland 
the cash proceeds from the sale were used in early to acquire the land for the mall at partridge creek  as part of a like kind exchange pursuant to section of the internal revenue code and the regulations thereunder section like kind exchange 
additional proceeds were also used to purchase the land and real property improvements of the oyster bay development  also as part of a section like kind exchange  and to pay off the outstanding balance on the loan on the property

application of critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the financial statements and disclosures 
some of these estimates and assumptions require application of difficult  subjective  and or complex judgment  often about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods 
we are required to make such estimates and assumptions when applying the following accounting policies 
valuation of shopping centers all properties  including those under construction and or owned by joint ventures  are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
impairment of a shopping center owned by consolidated entities would be recognized when the sum of expected cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying value of the property 
other than temporary impairment of an investment in an unconsolidated joint venture is recognized when the carrying value is not considered recoverable based on evaluation of the severity and duration of the decline in value  including the results of discontinued cash flow and other valuation techniques 
the expected cash flows of a shopping center are dependent on estimates and other factors subject to change  including changes in the national  regional  and or local economic climates  competition from other shopping centers  stores  clubs  mailings  and the internet  increases in operating costs  bankruptcy and or other changes in the condition of third parties  including anchors and tenants  and expected holding period 
these factors could cause our expected future cash flows from a shopping center to change  and  as a result  an impairment could be considered to have occurred 
to the extent an impairment has occurred  the excess carrying value of the asset over its estimated fair value is charged against operations 
there were no impairment charges recognized in the periods covered within this annual report 
as of december   the consolidated net book value of our properties was billion  representing over of our consolidated assets 
we also have varying ownership percentages in the properties of unconsolidated joint ventures with a total combined net book value of billion 
these amounts include certain development costs that are described in the policy that follows 
capitalization of development costs in developing shopping centers  we typically obtain land or land options  zoning and regulatory approvals  anchor commitments  and financing arrangements during a process that may take several years and during which we may incur significant costs 
we capitalize all development costs once it is considered probable that a project will reach a successful conclusion 
prior to this time  we expense all costs relating to a potential development  including payroll  and include these costs in funds from operations see presentation of operating results 
many factors in the development of a shopping center are beyond our control  including changes in the national  regional  and or local economic climates  competition from other shopping centers  stores  clubs  mailings  and the internet  availability and cost of financing  changes in regulations  laws  and zoning  and decisions made by third parties  including anchors 
these factors could cause our assessment of the probability of a development project reaching a successful conclusion to change 
if a project subsequently was considered less than probable of reaching a successful conclusion  a charge against operations for previously capitalized development costs would occur 
our approximately million balance of development pre construction costs as of december  consists of costs relating to our oyster bay project in the town of oyster bay  new york 
see liquidity and capital resources planned capital spending regarding the status of this project 
valuation of accounts receivable rents and expense recoveries from tenants are our principal source of income  they represent over of our revenues 
in generating this income  we will routinely have accounts receivable due from tenants 
the collectibility of tenant receivables is affected by bankruptcies  changes in the economy  and the ability of the tenants to perform under the terms of their lease agreements 
while we estimate potentially uncollectible receivables and provide for them through charges against income  actual experience may differ from those estimates 
also  if a tenant were not able to perform under the terms of its lease agreement  receivable balances not previously provided for may be required to be charged against operations 
bad debt expense was less than of total revenues in  while bankruptcy filings affected a record low of tenant leases during the year 
since  the annual provision for losses on accounts receivable has been less than of annual revenues 
valuations for acquired property and intangibles upon acquisition of an investment property  including that of an additional interest in an asset already partially owned  we make an assessment of the valuation and composition of assets and liabilities acquired 
these assessments consider fair values of the respective assets and liabilities and are determined based on estimated future cash flows using appropriate discount and capitalization rates and other commonly accepted valuation techniques 
the estimated future cash flows that are used for this analysis reflect the historical operations of the property  known trends and changes expected in current market and economic conditions which would impact the property s operations  and our plans for such property 
these estimates of cash flows and valuations are particularly important given the application of fasb statement nos 
and for the allocation of purchase price between land  building and improvements  and other identifiable intangibles 
new accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb issued staff position fsp no 
fas accounting for rental costs incurred during a construction period 
this fsp requires that rental costs associated with ground or building operating leases incurred during a construction period be recognized as rental expense 
however  fsp no 
fas does not address lessees that account for the sale or rental of real estate projects under fasb statement no 
accounting for costs and initial rental operations of real estate projects 
as our policy is to capitalize rental costs associated with ground leases incurred during construction periods under statement no 
 fsp no 
fas will not have a material effect on our results of operations when it becomes effective in in june  the fasb ratified the eitf s consensus on issue no 
determining whether a general partner  or the general partners as a group  controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights 
this consensus establishes the presumption that general partners in a limited partnership control that limited partnership regardless of the extent of the general partners ownership interest in the limited partnership 
the consensus further establishes that the rights of the limited partners can overcome the presumption of control by the general partners  if the limited partners have either a the substantive ability to dissolve liquidate the limited partnership or otherwise remove the general partners without cause or b substantive participating rights 
whether the presumption of control is overcome is a matter of judgment based on the facts and circumstances  for which the consensus provides additional guidance 
this consensus is currently applicable to us for new or modified partnerships  and will otherwise be applicable to existing partnerships in this consensus applies to limited partnerships or similar entities  such as limited liability companies that have governing provisions that are the functional equivalent of a limited partnership 
with the issuance of eitf and the amendment of statement of position  accounting for investments in real estate ventures sop and the corresponding changes and considerations surrounding control  we have determined that in the first quarter of we will begin consolidating the entity that owns the cherry creek shopping center 
this entity is currently accounted for under the equity method in accordance with the provisions of sop under the equity method  net income loss was allocated to the outside partner based on ownership percentage 
because the net equity balance of the outside partner is less than zero  income will be allocated to the outside partner equal to its share of distributions and the outside partner s interest will be presented as a zero balance in the consolidated balance sheet 
the net equity balance of the outside partner s interest is zero due to accumulated distributions in excess of net income and not as a result of operating losses 
distributions to partners are usually greater than net income because net income includes non cash charges for depreciation and amortization 
as of january   the impact to the balance sheet will be an increase in assets of approximately million and liabilities of approximately million  and a million reduction of beginning equity representing the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
in may  the fasb issued statement no 
accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 

this statement changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
opinion previously required that most voluntary changes in accounting principle be recognized by including in net income of the period of the change the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle 
this statement requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
in the event of such impracticality  this statement provides for other means of application 
in the event that we change accounting principles  we will evaluate the impact of statement no 
in december  the fasb issued statement no 
revised share based payment 
this statement establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services 
it also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments 
this statement requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award with limited exceptions 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award the requisite service period usually the vesting period 
no compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render the requisite service 
a public entity will initially measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of liability instruments based on its current fair value  the fair value of that award will be remeasured subsequently at each reporting date through the settlement date 
changes in fair value during the requisite service period will be recognized as compensation cost over that period 
statement no 
revised will be effective in we expect that adoption of this statement will not have a material effect on our future results of operations 
we currently apply statement no 
accounting for stock based compensation  including its provisions for the expense recognition of options 
as part of our adoption of statement no 
revised  for any grant for which vesting accelerates upon retirement  we will begin recognizing compensation cost from the date of the grant through the date the employee first becomes eligible to retire  if this period is shorter than the stated vesting period of the grant 
currently  we recognize compensation cost using the stated vesting period  regardless of retirement eligibility 
if we had applied the new practice historically  it would not have any had a material impact on our results of operations for any period presented  nor is it expected to have a material impact on future results of operations 
presentation of operating results the following tables contain the operating results of our consolidated businesses and the unconsolidated joint ventures 
income allocated to the minority partners in the operating partnership and preferred interests is deducted to arrive at the results allocable to our common shareowners 
because the net equity of the operating partnership is less than zero  the income allocated to the minority partners is equal to their share of distributions 
the net equity of these minority partners is less than zero due to accumulated distributions in excess of net income and not as a result of operating losses 
distributions to partners are usually greater than net income because net income includes non cash charges for depreciation and amortization 
amounts allocable to minority partners in certain consolidated joint ventures are added back or deducted to arrive at our net results 
our average ownership percentage of the operating partnership was in  in  and in the results of international plaza are presented within the consolidated businesses for periods beginning july   as a result of our acquisition of a controlling interest in the center 
prior to the acquisition date  this center is included within the unconsolidated joint ventures 
the operating results in the following tables include the supplemental earnings measures of beneficial interest in ebitda and funds from operations ffo 
beneficial interest in ebitda represents the operating partnership s share of the earnings before interest and depreciation and amortization  excluding gains on sales of depreciated operating properties of its consolidated and unconsolidated businesses 
we believe beneficial interest in ebitda provides a useful indicator of operating performance  as it is customary in the real estate and shopping center business to evaluate the performance of properties on a basis unaffected by capital structure 
the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit defines ffo as net income loss computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  excluding gains or losses from extraordinary items and sales of properties  plus real estate related depreciation and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
we believe that ffo is a useful supplemental measure of operating performance for reits 
historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  we and most industry investors and analysts have considered presentations of operating results that exclude historical cost depreciation to be useful in evaluating the operating performance of reits 
we primarily use ffo in measuring performance and in formulating corporate goals and compensation 
our presentation of ffo is not necessarily comparable to the ffo of other reits due to the fact that not all reits use the nareit definition 
ffo should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indicator of our operating performance 
additionally  ffo does not represent cash flows from operating  investing or financing activities as defined by gaap 
prior to the fourth quarter of  we did not include an add back for depreciation of center replacement assets when computing our beneficial interest in ebitda or ffo 
as of the fourth quarter of  we began to include such an add back for depreciation on assets whose cost was recovered from tenants over a period of more than one year and we restated previously reported ebitda and ffo amounts 
we did this both to be consistent with industry practice and because we have begun offering our tenants the option to pay a fixed charge or pay their share of common area maintenance cam costs 
as more tenants elect the fixed cam option  over time there will be significantly less matching of cam income with cam capital related expenses  which was the basis for our prior reporting practice 
because of this change in our business practice and related contractual terms of leases  we have reviewed our history of expenditures on center replacement assets  including assets reimbursed in the year of acquisition  in order to appropriately set pricing for our fixed cam option and to provide information for planning future expenditures 
since the depreciation periods for cam assets are matched to the periods over which we expect to recover the costs of the assets the period of benefit to the company  cam assets recovered in the year of acquisition are depreciated over the same period 
as a result of this review of expenditures we have quantified the amount of cam assets which were recovered from tenants in the year of acquisition and depreciated over the period of recovery 
this additional amount of depreciation has been added back to calculate ebitda and ffo and we have restated previously reported amounts

the tendering partner will bear all market risk if the market price at closing is less than the purchase price and will bear the costs of sale 
any proceeds of the offering in excess of the purchase price will be for the sole benefit of tco

planned capital spending new centers groundbreaking occurred in november on an approximately  square foot center  the mall at partridge creek  in clinton township  michigan 
the center will be anchored by nordstrom  parisian  and mjr theatres 
the land for the site was purchased in september see contractual obligations and the center is scheduled to open in the fall of  with nordstrom opening in spring our investment in this center will be approximately million and we are expecting a stabilized return of 
in january  we entered into an agreement to invest in the pier at caesars the pier  located in atlantic city  new jersey  with gordon group holdings llc gordon  who is developing the center 
the pier is currently under construction  and is expected to open in may under the agreement  we will have a interest in the pier 
our capital contribution in the pier will be made in three steps 
the initial investment of million was made at the closing in january a second payment equal to of our projected required total investment less the initial million payment is expected to be made within six months after the project opens 
the third and final payment will be made shortly after the completion of the project s stabilization year based on its actual net operating income noi and debt levels 
our total capital contribution will be computed at a price to be calculated at a seven percent capitalization rate 
depending on the performance of the project  we expect our total cash investment to be in the range of million to million 
during construction of the project  gordon will loan the venture the funding for capital expenditures in excess of the construction loan financing 
interest on the loan will be accruable at the short term applicable federal rate afr under section d of the internal revenue code and will be repaid before any distributions to the venture partners 
the contributions of the company will be used to repay the principal portion of the loan 
consequently  the company expects that its share of distributions and income will initially be less than its residual interest 
in addition to our acquisition of an interest in the pier  we have entered into a joint development agreement with gordon to develop certain future casino and entertainment oriented retail projects 
the five year agreement  which includes extension options  requires each party to offer an equal ownership of future development opportunities for such projects to the other party

the mall will be anchored by nordstrom and neiman marcus 
the demolition of the site is finished  and we are working with the community to resolve all issues remaining prior to special use permit approval and the issuance of building permits 
once we have received the necessary approvals we expect to finalize our anticipated costs and return on this project and set an opening date 
the returns on this project will be somewhat lower than our normal targets due to the significant pre development and construction costs on this site resulting from the unanticipated delays in the approval and entitlement process 
we expect success with the ongoing negotiations  but if we are ultimately unsuccessful in the negotiation process  it is anticipated that the recovery on this asset would be significantly less than our current investment 
existing centers construction is underway on an expansion and renovation at waterside shops at pelican bay 
the expansion will increase the size of the center to  square feet and will cost approximately million 
we expect a return of approximately on our million share of project costs 
the tenants will begin opening in stages in in addition  nordstrom will join the center as an anchor in and an expansion of the current anchor  saks fifth avenue  will be completed in late or early we have announced plans for the addition of a  square foot nordstrom  a  square foot expansion and renovation of marshall field s  and approximately  square feet of additional new store space at twelve oaks mall 
construction is expected to begin in early and be completed by fall we expect a return on our estimated cost of million 
at stamford town center we purchased the filene s store  which closed in january demolition of the former filene s building is expected to begin in the first quarter of and we are currently finalizing our plans for new restaurant and retail space 
while we have not yet determined the total project costs  we expect the total cost to be somewhat higher than million with a high single digit return
