item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

on february   we acquired natumi ag  a german producer and marketer of soymilk and other non dairy products 
all of the foregoing acquisitions the acquisitions or acquired brands have been accounted for as purchases 
consequently  the operations of the acquired brands are included in our results of operations from their respective dates of acquisition 
on june   we sold our kineret and kosherific brands  which marketed and distributed a line of frozen and dry kosher food products 
we acquired these brands in fiscal on august   we sold our biomarch operations 
biomarch is a belgian based provider of fresh organic fruits and vegetables 
we acquired the biomarch operations in fiscal critical accounting policies our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the accounting principles we use require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods presented 
we believe in the quality and reasonableness of our critical accounting policies  however  it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using assumptions different from those that we have consistently applied 
we believe our critical accounting policies are as follows  including our methodology for estimates made and assumptions used revenue recognition and sales incentives sales are recognized when the earnings process is complete  which occurs when products are shipped in accordance with terms of agreements  title and risk of loss transfer to customers  collection is probable and pricing is fixed or determinable 
sales are reported net of sales incentives  which include trade discounts and promotions and certain coupon costs 
shipping and handling costs billed to customers are included in reported sales 
allowances for cash discounts are recorded in the period in which the related sale is recognized 
valuation of accounts and chargebacks receivable we perform ongoing credit evaluations on existing and new customers daily 
we apply reserves for delinquent or uncollectible trade receivables based on a specific identification methodology and also apply a general reserve based on the experience we have with our trade receivables aging categories 
credit losses have been within our expectations in recent years 
while one of our customers represented approximately of our trade receivable balance at june   we believe there is no credit exposure at this time 
based on cash collection history and other statistical analysis  we estimate the amount of unauthorized deductions that our customers have taken to be repaid and collectible in the near future in the form of a chargeback receivable 
while our estimate of this receivable balance could be different had we used different assumptions and judgments  historically our cash collections of this type of receivable have been within our expectations and no significant write offs have occurred during the most recent three fiscal years 
there can be no assurance that we would have the same experience with our receivables during different economic conditions  or with changes in business conditions  such as consolidation within the food industry and or a change in the way we market and sell our products 
inventory our inventory is valued at the lower of actual cost or market  utilizing the first in  first out method 
we provide write downs for finished goods expected to become non saleable due to age and specifically identify and provide for slow moving or obsolete raw ingredients and packaging 
property  plant and equipment our property  plant and equipment is carried at cost and depreciated or amortized on a straight line basis over the lesser of the estimated useful lives or lease life  whichever is shorter 
we believe the asset lives assigned to our property  plant and equipment are within ranges guidelines generally used in food manufacturing and distribution businesses 
our manufacturing plants and distribution centers  and their related assets  are periodically reviewed to determine if any impairment exists by analyzing underlying cash flow projections 
at this time  we believe no impairment exists on the carrying value of such assets 
ordinary repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred 
intangibles goodwill is no longer amortized and the value of an identifiable intangible asset is amortized over its useful life unless the asset is determined to have an indefinite useful life 
the carrying value of goodwill  which is allocated to the company s six reporting units  and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested annually for impairment 
segments sfas no 
defines an operating segment as that component of an enterprise i that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses  ii whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the enterprise s chief operating decision maker codm to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance  and iii for which discrete financial information is available 
sfas no 
de fines a reporting unit as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component 
the company has determined that it operates in one segment  the sale of natural and organic products  including food  beverage and personal care products  and further that such single segment includes six reporting units in the annual test of goodwill for impairment 
characteristics of the company s operations which are relied on in making these determinations include the similarities apparent in the company s products in the natural and organic consumer markets  the commonality of the company s customers across brands  the company s unified marketing strategy  and the nature of the financial information used by the codm  described below  other than information on sales and direct product costs  by brand 
the company s six reporting units are grocery including snacks  tea  personal care  protein  canada  and europe 
the company has further determined that its chairman of the board and chief executive officer is the company s codm as defined in sfas no 
 and is also the manager of the company s single segment 
in making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment  the company s codm focuses on sales performance by brand using internally generated sales data as well as externally developed market consumption data acquired from independent sources  and further reviews certain data regarding standard costs and standard gross margins by brand 
in making these decisions  the codm receives and reviews certain company consolidated quarterly and year to date information  however  the codm does not receive or review any discrete financial information by geographic location  business unit  subsidiary  division or brand 
the codm reviews and approves capital spending on a company consolidated basis rather than at any lower unit level 
the company s board of directors receives the same quarterly and year to date information as the company s codm 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal net sales in were million  an increase of million or over net sales of million in the increase in sales came from volume increases principally in our domestic grocery and snacks brands  which were up  and our personal care brands  which were up 
these increases came from strong performance in grocery and snack brands such as earth s best  up  imagine soups  up  garden of eatin  up  walnut acres organic  up and westbrae  up 
with the sku rationalization program affecting sales performance principally in the grocery and snacks brands  many of our other brands experienced slower or negative growth on actual shipments  while individual skus within brands accelerated 
in our personal care unit  we saw strong increases from our jason brand  with sales up 
our celestial seasonings tea brand was up for the year after experiencing the challenge of an extremely warm winter season when it typically has strong sales in cold months 
our canada unit increased sales by and in europe we experienced increases of 
we saw sales increases from companies we acquired during both the and years  including our hain pure protein antibiotic free chicken unit  spectrum organic products in grocery and snacks  para laboratories in personal care  and both the meat free frozen operation and the fresh prepared foods operation in europe 
gross profit in was of net sales as compared to of net sales in gross profit in was negatively impacted by the inclusion of the operations of our hain pure protein antibiotic free chicken unit and the new fresh prepared foods unit in europe  each of which operates at margins significantly lower than our other units 
without the negative impact of these units gross margins  our gross margins would have been  or higher than our total 
gross margin was further affected by charges for our sku rationalization program of million  or in  and million  or in our gross margin performance has also been negatively impacted by the increasing costs of petroleum  ingredients  health care and other input costs 
we have offset these increasing costs with the successful implementation of price increases for selected products we sell  and with a sharper focus on operating efficiencies  including the positive effects of our sku rationalization program 
our gross margin as a percentage of sales has been further diluted by the mix of our sales as our higher margin tea sales continue to contribute a lower proportion of our consolidated sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million to million in from million in these expenses as a percentage of net sales were in compared to in selling  general and administrative expenses increased from the addition of million of costs added with acquisitions in  and were further increased by a million charge associated with the adoption of fas no 
r see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
other increases result from the increasing scale of our business 
operating income was million in compared to million in operating income as a percentage of net sales was in compared to in these changes are a result of higher sales and better gross margin performance  as well as the reduced results in having been caused by the million of charges for our sku rationalization program 
interest and other expenses  net  amounted to million in compared to million in we incurred higher interest costs in resulting from borrowings for acquisitions and higher market interest rates 
in may  we completed a private placement of million of year fixed rate notes 
income before income taxes in amounted to million compared to in the increase is attributable to the aforementioned increase in operating income offset by the increase in interest and other expenses  net 
income taxes in amounted to million compared to million in our effective tax rate was in compared to in our lower effective tax rate in was attributable to a reduction in tax liabilities resulting from the termination of certain outstanding tax matters  while in we had million of benefits from tax deductions related to the exercise of stock options which were subject to accelerated vesting in net income in amounted to million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share in the increase was attributable to the aforementioned increase in income before income taxes  and for per share amounts  offset by a increase in the number of weighted average shares used in the computation 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales in were million  an increase of million or over net sales of million in the increase came from volume increases  the phasing in of price increases and from sales generated by brands acquired in  with increases offset by reduced sales due to the elimination of our carbfit brand  which experienced strong sales during the prior year  before the decline in consumer demand for low carbohydrate products 
we experienced strong brand sales gains for terra  which was up  garden of eatin  which was up  earth s best  which was up  imagine soups  which was up  and to a lesser extent increased sales of celestial seasoning teas  which was up 
sales of our brands in europe increased 
gross profit in was of net sales as compared to of net sales in the decline in gross profit percentage was principally the result of a million charge for our sku rationalization program  which had the effect of reducing gross profit by percentage points 
after considering the effect of the sku rationalization  our margins remained relatively flat as a result of the price increases we phased in beginning july  and june   which provided us with an almost equal offset to increases in ingredient and other input costs  increases in transportation costs resulting from higher fuel costs  the cost effects of new regulations on the us trucking industry in effect for the full fiscal year  an increase in the percentage of our shipments that are delivered by us  which has stabilized since we first experienced such increases in our third quarter of fiscal  and a change in the mix of products sold whereby our higher margin tea sales became a lower proportion of our consolidated sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses  excluding non cash compensation  increased by million to million in from million in such expenses as a percentage of net sales amounted to in as compared with in selling  general and administrative expenses have increased in overall dollars  primarily as a result of costs brought on by brands acquired in  increased consumer marketing expenses needed to support our increased sales as well as increases across all levels of general and administrative expenses to support our growing business 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended june  in cludes approximately million for the sku rationalization program and approximately million of outside professional costs for sarbanes oxley compliance 
non cash compensation expenses were million in  an increase of million from million in the increase in non cash compensation expenses primarily relate to the accelerated vesting of employee stock options in june  when our board of directors approved the acceleration of the vesting of all outstanding unvested stock options held by employees 
this action was taken in order to reduce future compensation charges for these stock options and to provide an incentive to employees in view of the uncertainty of future equity based compensation with the pending implementation of sfas no 
r 
as a result of this action  approximately million outstanding unvested stock options were accelerated approximately  of which were at exercise prices greater than market price at the date of acceleration  substantially all of which were granted in august at an exercise price of per share with original vesting through august we recognized a charge to earnings for the difference between the market value of our stock on the date of acceleration and the exercise price of the options  such charge amounting to approximately million million net of tax for the year ended june  as a result of this action  there will be no stock option amortization expense in future periods unless additional stock options are granted 
operating income was million or in compared to million or in the decline in operating income was the result of the aggregate of million of charges from sku rationalization program and the acceleration of vesting of stock options 
after considering the effect of such million of charges  operating income was million in  representing a increase over this increase results principally from higher sales coupled by stable margins and lower selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales 
interest and other expenses  net  amounted to million in compared to million in our interest expense was million higher in as compared to  principally as a result of the higher interest rates on higher average borrowings we carried this year after our recent acquisitions 
we had million in net currency exchange gains in the current year as compared to less than million in net currency exchange losses in the prior year  which partially offset the additional interest costs 
income before income taxes in amounted to million compared to million in this decrease is attributable to the aforementioned decrease in operating income and increase in interest and other expenses  net 
after considering the effect of the aggregate of million of charges from sku rationalization program and the acceleration of vesting of stock options  income before income taxes was million representing an increase of million  or over the prior year 
this increase results principally from higher sales coupled with stable margins and lower selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales 
our effective income tax rate approximated of pre tax income for compared to for this decrease was attributable to a million reduction in tax liabilities resulting from the termination of certain outstanding tax matters and is equal to the amount charged against the company s earnings when these arose in prior years 
net income in amounted to million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share  in the decrease of million in net income was primarily attributable to the aforementioned decrease in income before income taxes offset by the decrease in our effective tax rate 
liquidity and capital resources we finance our operations and growth primarily with the cash flows we generate from our operations and from both long term fixed rate borrowings and borrowings available to us under our credit facility 
on may   we issued million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes due may  in a private placement 
proceeds from the senior notes were used to repay outstanding borrowings of million under the company s revolving credit facility 
the notes bear interest at  payable semi annually on november nd and may nd 
also on may   we entered into a new amended and restated credit agreement  providing us with a million credit facility the credit facility expiring in may the credit facility provides for an uncommitted million accordion feature  under which the facility may be increased to million 
the credit facility and the senior notes are guaranteed by substantially all of our current and future direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries 
revolving credit loans under the credit facility bear interest at a base rate greater of the applicable prime rate or federal funds rate plus an applicable margin or  at our option  the reserve adjusted libor rate plus an applicable margin 
as of june   million was outstanding under the senior notes at an interest rate of  and no borrowings were outstanding under the credit facility 
we are required by the terms of the credit facility and the senior notes to comply with customary affirmative and negative covenants for facilities and notes of this nature 
this access to capital provides us with flexible working capital needs in the normal course of business and the opportunity to grow our business through acquisitions or develop our existing infrastructure through capital investment

seasonality our tea brand manufactures and markets hot tea products and as a result its quarterly results of operations reflect seasonal trends resulting from increased demand for its hot tea products in the cooler months of the year 
in addition  some of our other products eg  baking and cereal products and soups also show stronger sales in the cooler months while our snack food product lines are stronger in the warmer months 
quarterly fluctuations in our sales volume and operating results are due to a number of factors relating to our business  including the timing of trade promotions  advertising and consumer promotions and other factors  such as seasonality  inclement weather and unanticipated increases in labor  commodity  energy  insurance or other operating costs 
the impact on sales volume and operating results due to the timing and extent of these factors can significantly impact our business 
for these reasons  you should not rely on our quarterly operating results as indications of future performance 
inflation management does not believe that inflation had a significant impact on our results of operations for the periods presented 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the principal market risks ie  the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices to which the company is exposed are interest rates on debt and cash equivalents  and foreign exchange rates  generating translation and transaction gains and losses 
interest rates we centrally manage our debt and cash equivalents considering investment opportunities and risks  tax consequences and overall financing strategies 
our cash equivalents consist primarily of commercial paper and obligations of us government agencies 
we had no variable debt at june  assuming current cash equivalents levels  a one point change in interest rates would have the effect of increasing our interest income which is included in interest and other expense  net  by an insignificant amount 
foreign operations operating in international markets involves exposure to movements in currency exchange rates  which are volatile at times 
the economic impact of currency exchange rate movements is complex because such changes are often linked to variability in real growth  inflation  interest rates  governmental actions and other factors 
consequently  isolating the effect of changes in currency does not incorporate these other important economic factors 
these changes  if material  could cause adjustments to our financing and operating strategies 
during fiscal  approximately of our net sales were generated from sales outside the united states  while such sales outside the united states were of net sales in and of net sales in we expect sales from non us markets to possibly represent an increasing portion of our total net sales in the future 
our non us sales and operations are subject to risks inherent in conducting business abroad  many of which are outside our control  including periodic economic downturns and unstable political environments  price and currency exchange controls  fluctuations in the relative values of currencies  unexpected changes in trading policies  regulatory requirements  tariffs and other barriers  compliance with applicable foreign laws  and difficulties in managing a global enterprise  including staffing  collecting accounts receivable and managing distributors
