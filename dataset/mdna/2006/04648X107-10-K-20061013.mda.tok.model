item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements  which involve risk and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including but not limited to those discussed in item a risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
our past stock option grant practices  and need to restate our financial statements we delayed the filing of this form k  pending completion of a previously announced independent investigation into our past stock option grant practices  being conducted by a special committee of our board of directors 
due to this delay and review  we have experienced substantial additional risks and costs 
the special committee s investigation was completed on september   with the delivery of the committee s final report on that date 
the investigation covered option grants made to all employees  directors and consultants during the period from january through june a key purpose of the investigation was to determine the correct measurement dates under applicable accounting principles for these options 
the measurement date means the date on which the option is deemed granted under applicable accounting principles  namely accounting principles board opinion no 
apb no 
 and is the first date on which all of the following are known the individual employee who is entitled to receive the option grant  the number of options that an individual employee is entitled to receive  and the option s purchase price 
the special committee found instances wherein incorrect measurement dates were used to account for certain option grants 
the special committee concluded that none of the incorrect measurement dates was the result of fraud 
the last option grant for which the measurement date was found to be in error was made in february specifically  the special committee determined that there was an insufficient basis to rely on the company s process and relating documentation to support recorded measurement dates used to account for most stock options granted primarily during calendar years through  the company had numerous grants made by means of unanimous written consents signed by board or compensation committee members wherein all the signatures of the members were not received on the grant date specified in the consents and the company made several company wide grants pursuant to an approval of the board or compensation committee  but the list of grantees and number of options allocated to each grantee was not finalized as of the stated grant date 
the special committee also found that  during the period from april through february  the company set the grant date and exercise price of rank and file employee option grants for new hires and promotions 
table of contents at the lowest price of the first five business days of the month following the month of their hire or promotion 
the net impact of this practice was an aggregate charge of less than  the special committee identified isolated instances where stock option grants did not comply with applicable terms and conditions of the stock plans from which the grants were issued 
for example  the committee determined that on two occasions  the company granted options to directors that exceeded the annual automatic grant amount specified in the applicable plan 
on another occasion  a grant to a director was approved one day before the individual became a director 
in addition  one grant was made to an officer of the company by the chief executive officer under delegated authority  however  under the terms of the applicable plan  the option grant should have been made by the company s board or its compensation committee 
there were also isolated instances where option grants were made below fair market value 
the applicable stock option plans require that option grants must be made at fair market value on the date of grant 
however  the committee did not find any evidence that these violations were committed for improper purposes 
the special committee found no evidence that any incorrect measurement dates was the result of fraud 
the special committee concluded that the errors in measurement dates it reviewed resulted primarily from a combination of unintentional errors  lack of attention to timely paperwork  and lack of internal control over aspects of equity plan administration including lack of oversight in applying the accounting rule described above in connection with determining measurement dates during the period in which the errors occurred based on results of the special committee s investigation  the company recorded stock based compensation charges  and additional payroll taxes with respect to its employee stock option grants for which the measurement dates were found to be in error 
while the impact of recording these charges was not material to the fiscal years ended march  and  the company deemed it appropriate to record the charges in the relevant periods 
accordingly  the company restated the results of fiscal years and  to record a net charge of approximately million per share in fiscal and a net benefit of million per share in fiscal additionally  the company recorded a net charge of million to its accumulated deficit as of april  for cumulative charges relating to fiscal years prior to fiscal during the fiscal year ended march   the company recorded a net charge of approximately million relating to the re measurement of stock options resulting from the investigation 
at march   the remaining unamortized deferred stock based compensation charge to be recognized in future periods was less than million 
in view of its history of operating losses  the company has maintained a full valuation allowance on its us deferred tax assets since fiscal as a result  there is no material income tax impact relating to the stock based compensation and payroll tax expenses recorded by the company resulting from the investigation of the special committee during fiscal years  and additionally  there was no material impact of section a and section m limitations on deduction of executive stock compensation for fiscal years  and as a result of the findings described above  our restated consolidated financial statements reflect a cumulative increase in net loss of approximately million for the fiscal years through  consisting of non cash adjustments to stock based compensation expense resulting from the stock option grant and exercise practices discussed above  together with payroll and income tax impact 
these expenses resulted in an increase to our accumulated deficit 
adjustments are also reported in our consolidated statements of operations in subsequent periods based on the accounting treatment for exercises  modifications and expenses recognized over the remaining option vesting periods 
we have increased decreased previously reported net loss by an aggregate amount of million and million for the years ended march   respectively 
the adjustments increased reduced previously reported basic and diluted net loss per common share by and for the years ended march  and  respectively 
the cumulative effect of the restatement adjustments on our consolidated balance sheet at march  resulted in an increase in accumulated deficit of approximately million  an increase in deferred stock based compensation of approximately million and an increase in additional paid in capital of approximately million  resulting in a net decrease in total stockholders equity of approximately million 

table of contents cost of restatement and legal activities the option grant investigation was time consuming  required asyst to incur significant additional expenses  estimated to be approximately to million over the first three quarters of our fiscal year  and required significant management attention and resources during this period 
the delay in filing this form k and the form q for our fiscal quarter ended june  has also triggered a purported notice of default from the indenture trustee for our outstanding convertible notes 
in may  certain analysts published reports suggesting that asyst may have granted stock options in the past with favorable exercise prices in certain periods compared to stock prices before or after grant date 
subsequently  in early june  the sec and the united states justice department initiated inquiries relating to the option grant practices that were the subject to the special committee s investigation described above 
in addition  certain of the current and former directors and officers of the company have been named as defendants in two consolidated shareholder derivative actions filed in the united states district court of california  captioned in re asyst technologies  inc derivative litigation nd cal 
the federal action  and one similar shareholder derivative action filed in california state court  captioned forlenzo v 
schwartz  et al 
alameda county superior court the state action 
both actions seek to recover unspecified monetary damages  disgorgement of profits and benefits  equitable and injunctive relief  and attorneys fees and costs 
the state action also seeks the imposition of a constructive trust on all proceeds derived from the exercise of allegedly improper stock option grants 
the company is named as a nominal defendant in both the federal and state actions  thus no recovery against the company is sought 
we are not able to predict the future outcome of these governmental inquiries and legal actions 
these matters could result in significant legal expenses  diversion of management s attention from our business  commencement of formal civil or criminal administrative or litigation actions against asyst or current or former employees or directors  significant fines or penalties  indemnity commitments to current and former officers and directors and other material harm to our business 
the sec may also disagree with the manner in which we have accounted for and reported or not reported the financial impact of past option grant measurement date errors or other potential accounting errors  and there is a risk that its investigation could lead to circumstances in which we may have to further restate our prior financial statements  amend prior sec filings  or otherwise take other actions not presently contemplated 
any such circumstance could also lead to future delays in filing of our subsequent sec reports  and consequent risks of defaults under debt obligations and de listing of our common stock 
overview we develop  manufacture  sell and support integrated automation systems  primarily for the worldwide semiconductor and fpd manufacturing industries 
we principally sell directly to the semiconductor and fpd manufacturing industries 
we also sell to oems that make production equipment for sale to semiconductor manufacturers 
our strategy is to offer integrated automation systems that enable semiconductor and fpd manufacturers to increase their manufacturing productivity and yield and to protect their investment in fragile materials during the manufacturing process 
our functional currency is the us dollar  except for our japanese operations and their subsidiaries where our functional currency is the japanese yen 
the assets and liabilities of these japanese operations and their subsidiaries are generally translated using period end exchange rates 
translation adjustments are reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in our consolidated balance sheets 
on october   we established a joint venture with shinko  called asi 
the joint venture develops  manufactures  sells and supports amhs  with principal operations in tokyo and ise  japan 
under terms of the joint venture agreement  we acquired percent of the joint venture for approximately million of cash and transaction costs 
shinko contributed its entire amhs business  including intellectual property and other assets  installed customer base and approximately employees  and retained the remaining percent interest 
we acquired asi to enhance our presence in the mm amhs and flat panel display markets 
the acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase transaction in accordance with sfas no 
and  accordingly  the results of asi 
table of contents are included in the consolidated financial statements for the periods subsequent to its acquisition 
we now own of asi as a result of a purchase of shares in july described in item of this report 
we have two reportable segments the amhs segment  which consists principally of the entire asi operations  includes automated transport and loading systems  semiconductor and flat panel display products 
the fab automation product segment  which consists principally of the entire ati operations  includes interface products  auto id systems  substrate handling robotics  sorters  connectivity software  and cft 
we believe critical success factors include manufacturing cost reduction  product quality  customer relationships  and continued demand for our products 
demand for our products can change significantly from period to period as a result of numerous factors  including  but not limited to  changes in global economic conditions  fluctuations in the semiconductor equipment market  changes in customer buying patterns due to technological advancement and or capacity requirements  the relative competitiveness of our products  and our ability to manage successfully the outsourcing of our manufacturing activities to meet our customers demands for our products and services 
for this and other reasons  our results of operations for the fiscal year ended march   may not be indicative of future operating results 
we intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follow to provide information that will assist in understanding our financial statements  the changes in certain key items in those financial statements  the primary factors that resulted in those changes  and how certain accounting principles  policies and estimates affect our financial statements 
internal control matters we conclude in item a of this form k that our disclosure controls and procedures  and internal control over financial reporting were not effective as of march   the end of our fiscal year covered by this annual report 
item a provides a summary of material weaknesses outstanding as of that date that we identified in management s assessment of internal control and other related information 
see also in item a risk factors if we continue to fail to achieve and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting on a consolidated basis  our stock price and investor confidence in our company could be materially and adversely affected 
critical accounting policies and estimates general our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our consolidated financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  valuation of long lived assets  asset impairments  restructuring charges  goodwill and intangible assets  income taxes  and commitments and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates and judgments under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  product delivery has occurred or service has been rendered  the seller s price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
some 
table of contents of our products are large volume consumables that are tested to industry and or customer acceptance criteria prior to shipment and delivery 
our primary shipping terms are fob shipping point 
therefore  revenue for these types of products is recognized when title transfers 
certain of our product sales are accounted for as multiple element arrangements 
we allocate consideration to multiple element transactions based on relative objective evidence of fair values  which we determine based on prices charged for such items when sold on a stand alone basis 
if we have met defined customer acceptance experience levels with both the customer and the specific type of equipment  we recognize the product revenue at the time of shipment and transfer of title  with the remainder when the other elements  primarily installation  have been completed 
some of our other products are highly customized systems and cannot be completed or adequately tested to customer specifications prior to shipment from the factory 
we do not recognize revenue for these products until formal acceptance by the customer 
revenue for spare parts sales is recognized at the time of shipment and the transfer of title 
deferred revenue consists primarily of product shipments creating legally enforceable receivables that did not meet our revenue recognition policy 
revenue related to maintenance and service contracts is recognized ratably over the duration of the contracts 
unearned maintenance and service contract revenue is not significant and is included in accrued liabilities and other 
we recognize revenue for long term contracts at asi in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa  statement of position sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
we use the percentage of completion method to calculate revenue and related costs of these contracts because they are long term in nature and estimates of cost to complete and extent of progress toward completion of long term contracts are available and reasonably dependable 
we record revenue and unbilled receivables each period based on the percentage of completion to date on each contract  measured by costs incurred to date relative to the total estimated costs of each contract 
the unbilled receivables amount is reclassified to trade receivables once invoice is issued 
we disclose material changes in our financial results that result from changes in estimates 
the accuracy of our revenue and profit recognition for contracts accounted for using the percentage of completion in a given period is significantly influenced by our estimates of the cost to complete each project 
our cost estimates for all of our significant projects use a detailed bottom up approach and we believe our experience allows us to produce materially reliable estimates 
however  the profit margin estimates for a project will either increase or decrease to some extent from the amount that was originally estimated at the time of bid 
large changes in cost estimates  particularly in the bigger projects  can have a more significant effect on profitability 
we account for software revenue in accordance with the aicpa sop  software revenue recognition 
revenue for integration software work is recognized on a percentage of completion basis 
software license revenue  which is not material to the consolidated financial statements  is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the selling price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
allowance for doubtful accounts we estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts based on a combination of specifically identified amounts  as well as a portion of the reserve calculated based on the aging of receivables 
the additional reserve is provided for the remaining accounts receivable after specific allowances at a range of percentages from percent to percent based on the aging of receivables 
if circumstances change such as an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us or its payment trends  we may adjust our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us 
inventory reserves we evaluate the recoverability of all inventory  including raw materials  work in process  finished goods and spare parts  to determine whether adjustments for impairment are required 
inventory which is obsolete or in excess of our demand forecast is fully reserved 
such provisions  once established  are not reversed until the related inventories have been sold or scrapped 
if actual demand is lower than our forecast  additional inventory write downs may be required 
we outsource a majority of our fab automation product manufacturing to solectron 
as part of the arrangement  solectron purchases inventory for our benefit and we may be obligated to acquire inventory 
table of contents purchased by solectron if the inventory is not used over certain specified periods of time 
no revenue is recorded for the sale of inventory to solectron and any inventory buyback in excess of our demand forecast is fully reserved 
goodwill and other intangible assets we perform an annual goodwill impairment test in the third quarter of each fiscal year using a two step process 
the first step of the test identifies when impairment may have occurred  while the second step of the test measures the amount of the impairment  if any 
to determine the amount of the impairment  we estimate the fair value of our reporting segments that contain goodwill  based primarily on expected future cash flows  reduce the amount by the fair value of identifiable intangible assets other than goodwill also based primarily on expected future cash flows  and then compare the unallocated fair value of the business to the carrying value of goodwill 
to the extent goodwill exceeds the unallocated fair value of the business  an impairment expense is recognized 
in connection with the annual impairment analysis for goodwill  we assessed the recoverability of the intangible assets subject to amortization in accordance with financial accounting standards board statement fasb of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets to be disposed of sfas no 

warranty reserve our warranty policy generally states that we will provide warranty coverage for a pre determined amount of time  generally to months  for material and labor to repair and service our equipment 
since fiscal year  solectron has assumed the warranty liability for the first months on products it manufactures  and we are liable for warranty obligations beyond months 
we record the estimated warranty cost upon shipment of our products or receipt of customer s final acceptance 
the estimated warranty cost is determined based on the warranty term and historical warranty costs for a specific product 
if actual product failure rates or material usage differs from our estimates  we may need to revise our estimated warranty reserve 
accounting for income taxes we have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we have considered our future taxable income and tax planning strategies in assessing our valuation allowance 
future taxable income is based upon our estimates  and actual results may significantly differ from these estimates due to the volatility of our industry 
if in the future we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax in excess of the net amount recorded  we would record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset  increasing income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  we would record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset  charging income in the period such determination was made 
the calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex global tax regulations 
we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary  the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 
if the estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate tax assessment  a further charge to expense would result 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate the recoverability of our long lived tangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
long lived assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows from the use of the assets and its eventual disposition 
measurement of an impairment loss for long lived assets is based on the fair value of the assets 
long lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less estimated costs to sell

table of contents the following is a summary of our net sales  costs of sales  gross profit and income loss from operations by segment and consolidated total for the periods presented below in thousands fiscal year ended march  as reported adjustments as restated as reported adjustments as restated amhs net sales cost of sales gross profit income loss from operations fab automation products net sales cost of sales gross profit income loss from operations consolidated net sales cost of sales gross profit income loss from operations net sales net sales for the fiscal year ended march  were million  a decrease of million or percent  from the prior year 
selling price erosion was not a primary contributor to the decrease in net sales for the period 
the decrease in fiscal year sales volume was attributable to sales decreases in our amhs segment of million  primarily due to fpd declines of million and mm products of million 
the fpd decline was the result of completion of a very large project in the prior year 
this was partially offset by sales volume increases of million for services and sales of our mm product line increasing by an additional million 
net sales from the fab automation products segment were million  a decrease of million  or percent from prior year 
the sales decreases in our fab segment of million were primarily due to sales volumes of mm products decreasing by million and mm products and services decreasing by million 
net sales for the fiscal year ended march  were million  an increase of million  or percent  from fiscal year the increase in fiscal year sales were primarily attributable to sales volume increase in amhs and mm smif products sold to semiconductor manufacturers 
net sales from the fab automation products segment were million  an increase of million or percent from prior year 
net sales from the amhs segment were million  an increase of million or percent from the prior year 
this increase was primarily attributable to higher sales to fpd manufacturers in fiscal year 
table of contents sales by geographic region in thousands 
fiscal year ended march  united states japan taiwan korea other asia pacific europe total our sales in the united states have trended with the balance of the semiconductor industry over the past three fiscal years  with a substantial increase in fy  then a reduction in fy the japanese market for our products continues to improve  with sales in our amhs segment increasing at a moderate rate and our fab automation products segment sales increasing slightly 
the most significant changes  based on dollar values  as well as on a percentage basis  have been in the taiwan market 
the large increase in fy  compared to fy  was due to a million fpd project in fy  and while the decrease in fy  compared to fy  is substantial  the taiwan market is still a large portion of our sales and we expect this to continue 
the european market has been our smallest sales area  but continues to expand and we expect this trend to continue as well  due in part to greater acceptance by both the oems  as well as fabs for our spartan sorter and related products 
gross profit because the semiconductor capital equipment industry is subject to rapid fluctuations in demand  we have continued to make significant reductions and changes in our manufacturing operations to decrease the fixed component of our manufacturing costs and improve our margins during downturns 
in fiscal year  we continued to reduce our fixed manufacturing costs across all business lines  with gross profit increasing by million  even though net sales decreased by million compared to the prior year 
a major factor contributing to our gross margin improvement  is based on our poc revenue model at asi  with completion of projects in fy that had begun in fy or earlier and the related recognition of revenue that had been deferred or unbilled 
in fiscal year  we also worked on a very large fpd project that had lower margins  thereby explaining the improved product mix and overall gross margin as a percent of net sales in fiscal  compared to fiscal in fiscal year  we had reductions in workforce  in both us and international operations  and completed the transition of all of our us manufacturing operations to solectron and received the benefits of those activities during fiscal years and our gross profit was million  million and million for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
this represented percent  percent and percent of net sales for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
the increase in gross margin in fiscal year was due to gross margin improvement in both the fab automation products as well as the amhs segments 
the fab automation products income from operations were also improved through the sale of previously reserved inventory in the amount of million 
the gross margin improvement was attributable to continued product cost reductions through outsourced manufacturing and a lower cost supply chain 
the fiscal year gross margin for amhs was percent compared with percent in fiscal year the decrease of percent in amhs gross margin was due to the increase in mix of flat panel display sales that had lower margins than semiconductor sales 
we expect mm product sales to continue to increase as a percentage of our sales mix  although quarterly fluctuations are likely 
swings in product mix may impact our gross margins on a quarter over quarter basis 
through cost reduction initiatives and our outsourcing strategy  we expect continuing improvement in our mm gross margins although we expect price competition to continue 
we expect continued declines in our mm product sales in the next fiscal year as bookings in our key markets in china and elsewhere have slowed down 
our gross margin will continue to be affected by future changes in product mix and net sales volumes  as well as market 
table of contents and price competition 
we believe that  based on a normalized mix  gross margins at asi will trend toward a range of in the near term  which is more consistent with asi s historical gross margin performance 
research and development fiscal year ended march  as reported adjustments as restated change in thousands  except percentage research and development percentage of total net sales as restated as reported adjustments as restated change research and development percentage of total net sales research and development r d expenses decreased by million in fiscal year  compared to fiscal  due to payroll savings of million  reduced depreciation in the amount of million and other expenses of million 
the change between fiscal years and was primarily due to payroll savings 
the payroll savings mentioned in both comparisons were primarily the results from reductions in workforce 
selling  general and administrative fiscal year ended march  as reported adjustments as restated change in thousands  except percentage selling  general and administrative percentage of total net sales as restated as reported adjustments as restated change selling  general and administrative percentage of total net sales the selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased by million in fiscal year  primarily due to an increase of million in costs for auditing and the review and testing of internal controls over financial reporting required under the sarbanes oxley act of  an increase of million in our bad debt allowance and an increase of million in other fixed and payroll costs due to higher headcount in order to meet the increased financial and accounting requirements 
contributing to the fiscal year increase over fiscal was an increase of approximately million in our bad debt allowance  an increase of million for accounting and legal costs related to the fiscal year second quarter delay in closing asi s books and an increase of million due to the following the delayed filing of the second fiscal quarter form q and resulting nasdaq listing qualifications hearing process  the audit committee s investigation and q fiscal restatement  annual audit fees  the review and testing of 
table of contents internal controls over financial reporting required under the sarbanes oxley act of  and increased spending on consultants to implement business process improvements 
amortization of acquired intangible assets fiscal year ended march  change change in thousands  except percentage amortization of acquired intangible assets percentage of total net sales we amortize acquired intangible assets over periods ranging from three to ten years 
the decrease in amortization in fiscal year  compared to fiscal year in the amount of million was primarily due to assets being fully amortized during fiscal year restructuring and other charges credits restructuring and other charges accrual and related utilization for the fiscal years ended march   and were as follows in thousands severance and excess fixed assets benefits facilities impairment total balance  march  additional reduction in accruals non cash related utilization amounts paid in cash balance  march  additional reduction in accruals amounts paid in cash foreign currency translation adjustment balance  march  additional reduction in accruals non cash related utilization amounts paid in cash foreign currency translation adjustment balance  march  during fiscal year  we recorded only minor changes in estimates to our restructuring accrual as a result of completion of various lease and sub lease agreements  as well as final payments and adjustments on severance and benefit programs that were included in prior restructurings 
the outstanding accrual balance of million at march  consists of future lease obligations on operating leases which will be paid over the next two fiscal years 
all remaining accrual balances are expected to be settled in cash 
in fiscal year  we recorded net severance and other charges of million  primarily for severance costs from a reduction in workforce in december in december  we announced a restructuring initiative in our fab automation reporting segment  which involved the termination of employment of approximately employees 
the total costs of this restructuring were approximately million in termination benefits 
in fiscal year  we recorded net severance and other charges of million  primarily related to million in severance costs from a reduction in workforce in april  and a million charge related to the settlement and release of claims arising from the termination of a former officer 
included also were million of severance expenses  primarily from headcount reductions in our japanese operations 
in addition to the severance 
table of contents charges  we recorded million for exiting a facility in connection with our restructuring activities and for future lease obligations on a vacated facility in excess of estimated future sublease proceeds 
as a result of these restructuring activities  we terminated the employment of approximately employees from our us as well as international operations 
asset impairment charges asset impairment charges for fiscal years  and were as follows in thousands fiscal year ended march  land and building impairment in conjunction with the restructuring in fiscal  we had removed from service and made available for sale certain land and a building owned by aji 
the building had been underutilized since a prior decision to outsource the manufacturing of our next generation robotics products  part of an overall strategy to outsource the manufacture of all our fab automation segment products 
as a result  we recorded an impairment charge of million to write the assets down to their estimated fair value  based on a market valuation  less cost to sell 
we accounted for these assets as held for sale under sfas no 
in the third quarter of fiscal year  we re evaluated the status of the aji facility discussed above and based on an assessment of our expected future business needs  we reclassified the assets  as held and used 
in the fiscal year ended march   we completed the sale of land in fremont  california 
the net proceeds from the sale were million 
we had intended to construct corporate headquarters facilities on the land and subsequently decided not to build these facilities 
in fiscal year  we recorded a million write down based on our latest estimate of market value as supported by the pending sale agreement at the time 
interest and other income expense  net fiscal year ended march  fiscal year ended march  change change in thousands interest income interest expense other income expense  net total  net interest and other income expense  net was million  million and million for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
the increase in fiscal year over fiscal year was due to non recurring royalty income of approximately million becoming due to us upon achievement of certain contractual milestones from our royalty partner on our licensed products and interest income of million due to higher investment balances and interest rate 
the increase in fiscal year over fiscal year was primarily due to increased royalty receipts of million and foreign exchange gains of million 
provision for benefit from income taxes fiscal year ended march  fiscal year ended march  change change in thousands  except percentage provision for benefit from income taxes percentage of total net sales we recorded a tax provision of million for the fiscal year ended march   or percent of our income before income taxes  compared to a tax benefit of million for the fiscal year ended march   or 
table of contents percent of our loss before income taxes 
the tax provision in fiscal primarily relates to our international subsidiaries  offset by a tax benefit due to amortization of deferred tax liabilities recorded in connection with the asi acquisition of million and the recognition of foreign deferred tax assets of million 
the net change of million in the tax provision in fiscal compared to the benefit in is primarily due to a significant increase in income before income tax reported by the foreign subsidiaries million in compared to million in  the tax provisions for which are recorded at the statutory rate of each subsidiary  with an overall effective tax rate of approximately percent  a reduced tax benefit from the amortization of deferred tax liabilities related to asi acquisition million tax benefit in compared to million in  and tax benefit of approximately million related to utilization of aji s pre acquisition nol in no such benefit was recorded in we recorded a tax benefit of million for the fiscal year ended march   or percent of our loss before income taxes  compared to million for the fiscal year ended march   or percent of our loss before income taxes 
the tax benefit is primarily due to amortization of deferred tax liabilities recorded in connection with the asi acquisition of million  offset by tax provisions in our international subsidiaries 
we have completed the analysis of the impact of the one time favorable foreign dividend provision recently enacted as part of the american jobs creation act of based on the analysis performed  we have decided not to take actions by repatriating our foreign earnings at the current moment 
as of march   and based on the tax laws in effect at that time  we intended to continue to indefinitely reinvest our undistributed foreign earnings and accordingly  no deferred tax liability has been recorded on these undistributed foreign earnings 
minority interest minority interest in the net income loss of our subsidiaries was million  million  and million during fiscal years  and  respectively 
this amount primarily represents the percent share of our joint venture partner  shinko  in the operations of asi 
the changes reflect significant net income improvements in the amhs segment from fiscal through related party transactions at march  and march   we did not hold any outstanding loans due to us from current employees 
our majority owned subsidiary  asi  has certain transactions with its minority shareholder  shinko 
our majority owned subsidiary  aji  has certain transactions with mecs korea  in which aji is a minority shareholder 
at march  and  significant balances with shinko and mecs korea were in thousands fiscal year ended march  accounts payable due to shinko accrued liabilities due to shinko accounts receivable from mecs korea accounts payable due to mecs korea accrued liabilities due to mecs korea in addition  the consolidated financial statements reflect that asi purchased various products  installation  administrative and it services from shinko

sfas no 

sfas no 
amends apb opinion no 
to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
the provisions of this statement are effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  the adoption of the provisions of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
under sfas no 
r  companies are required to measure the compensation costs of share based compensation arrangements based on the grant date fair value and recognize the costs in the financial statements over the period during which employees are required to provide services 
share based compensation arrangements include stock options  restricted share plans  performance based awards  share appreciation rights and employee share purchase plans 
in april  the sec postponed the implementation date to the fiscal year beginning after june  the company will adopt sfas no 
r in the first quarter of fiscal the company has decided to use the modified prospective application mpa method 
by using the mpa  the company will not restate its prior period financial statements 
instead  the company applies sfas r for new options granted after the adoption of sfas r  ie april   and any portion of options that were granted after december  and have not vested by april  the company uses a black scholes option pricing model for calculating its option grant date fair value under sfas r 
the adoption of sfas no 
r will have a significant adverse impact on the company s results of operations  although it will have no impact on its overall financial position 
sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while the company cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amount of operating cash flows recognized for such excess tax deductions was zero for fiscal years  and in march  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 which provides guidance on the implementation of sfas no 
r  share based payment see discussion below

 accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of accounting principles board opinion no 
apb and fasb statement no sfas no 

sfas no 
requires retrospective application for voluntary changes in accounting principle unless it is 
table of contents impracticable to do so 
retrospective application refers to the application of a different accounting principle to previously issued financial statements as if that principle had always been used 
sfas no 
s retrospective application requirement replaces apb s requirement to recognize most voluntary changes in accounting principle by including in net income of the period of the change the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle 
this statement defines retrospective application as the application of a different accounting principle to prior accounting periods as if that principle had always been used or as the adjustment of previously issued financial statements to reflect a change in the reporting entity 
this statement also redefines restatement as the revising of previously issued financial statements to reflect the correction of an error 
the requirements are effective for accounting changes made in fiscal years beginning after december  and will only impact the consolidated financial statements in periods in which a change in accounting principle is made

liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have funded our operations primarily through the private sale of equity securities and public stock offerings  bank borrowings  long term debt and cash generated from operations 
as of march   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents  million in working capital and million in long term debt and capital lease obligations 
the table below  for the periods indicated  provides selected consolidated cash flow information in millions fiscal year ended march  net cash provided by used in operating activities net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities cash flows from operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year was million  consisting of in millions net loss depreciation and amortization allowance for doubtful accounts minority interest in net income of consolidated subsidiary other non cash charges decrease in accounts receivable increase in inventories decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets decrease in accounts payable  accrued liabilities and deferred margin net cash provided by operating activities significant changes in assets and liabilities during the fiscal year ended march  included accounts receivable  which decreased due to increased cash collections at asi  including receipts from the factoring of certain receivable balances in japan and a decline in revenues  prepaid expenses and other assets  which decreased due to a vat refund at asi from the japanese government  and accounts payable to related parties  which decreased at asi by million as described in note  related party transactions 

table of contents net cash used in operating activities in fiscal year was million 
it was primarily due to a net loss of million  an increase in accounts receivable  net of million and deferred taxes of million  and increase in inventories of million and prepaid expenses and other assets of million  partially offset by an increase in accounts payable  accrued liabilities and deferred margin of million  depreciation and amortization expenses of million  allowance for doubtful accounts of million  asset impairment charges of million  stock based compensation charges of million  loss on fixed assets disposals of million and the minority interest in the net income of our subsidiaries of million 
net cash used in operating activities in fiscal year was million 
it was primarily attributable to our net loss of million  increases in accounts receivable  net of million  primarily due to significantly higher revenue  an increase in inventory of million  deferred taxes of million and minority interest loss allocations of million 
these uses of cash were partially offset by a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets of million and non cash charges including depreciation and amortization of million  asset impairment charges of million  stock based compensation charges of million  loss on disposal of fixed assets of million and non cash restructuring charges of million 
additionally  accounts payable  accrued liabilities and deferred margin increased by a combined million  primarily due to increased purchasing activities to support higher revenue 
we continue to improve our days sales outstanding dso which have decreased to days at march   compared to days at march  and days at march  for billed and unbilled receivables 
the improvement in dso was primarily due to better cash collections through the use of factoring of receivables 
the decrease in unbilled receivables at march  compared to march  was attributable to the decreases in revenues of asi and completion of projects started in earlier periods 
the decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities at march  over those of march  was mainly attributable to higher collection of receivable and subsequent cash applied to payable balances at asi and aji  coupled with lower revenue in the business 
our inventory turns were times for the fiscal year  compared to times for fiscal year  primarily due to reduced sales of our products 
we expect that cash used in or provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors  including fluctuations in our operating results  collection of accounts receivable  timing of payments  and inventory levels

net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal year was million  due to million in proceeds from our line of credit and million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock programs  partially offset by million in pay downs against borrowings 
net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal year was million  primarily resulting from a total of million from issuance of common stock 
of this million  million was through our common stock offering and the remaining million was from our employee stock programs 
proceeds from this issuance were used in the repayment of million against our commercial banking line of credit 
in november  we sold  shares of our common stock  including exercise of the underwriters over allotment option  at an offering price to the public of per share 
we received total proceeds of million  net of the related issuance fees and costs 
on july   we completed the sale of million of percent convertible subordinated notes that resulted in aggregate proceeds of million to us  net of issuance costs 
the notes are convertible  at the option of the holder  at any time on or prior to maturity into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share  which is equal to a conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of notes 
the notes mature on july   pay interest on january and july of each year and are redeemable at par and at our option after july  debt issuance costs of million  net of amortization are included in other assets 
issuance costs are being amortized over months and are being charged to other income expense 
debt amortization costs totaled million during each of the years ended march   and  respectively 
notice of default relating to convertible subordinated notes 
asyst received a letter dated august  from us bank national association  as trustee under the indenture related to asyst s convertible subordinated notes due  which asserts that asyst is in default under the indenture because of the delays in filing with the sec its form k for the fiscal year ended march  and form q for the fiscal quarter ended june  the letter states that this asserted default is not an event of default under the indenture if the company cures the default within days after receipt of this notice  or the default is waived by the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the notes outstanding 
if an event of default were to occur  the trustee or the holders of at least in aggregate principal amount of the notes  of which million principal amount is outstanding  may accelerate maturity of the notes 
asyst does not agree with the trustee s assertion that the delayed filing of the annual and quarterly reports is a default under the indenture 
nonetheless  in conjunction with the filing of this report on form k we also intend to file with the sec our report on form q for the fiscal quarter ended june  upon completion of these filings  we intend to deliver to the trustee copies of the reports on form k and form q  and that delivery will cure any purported defaults under the indenture and asserted by the trustee in its letter referenced above 
acquisition and related debt financing facility 
at june   we established a million  three year  senior secured revolving credit and term loan facility 
the credit facility was arranged by banc of america securities llc 
bank of america  na will serve as administrative agent 
a syndicate of lenders and financial institutions  including comerica  development bank of japan  key bank  and union bank of california  is participating in the facility with bank of america 
we have the ability to borrow us dollars or japanese yen under the facility 
the facility carries a variable interest rate that is currently approximately on yen based balances 
we also anticipate amortizing approximately million of financing costs over the life of the facility 
on july   asyst and aji purchased from shinko shares of asi representing an additional of outstanding capital stock of asi for a cash purchase price of jpy billion approximately us million at the july exchange rate 
this purchase increased asyst s consolidated ownership of asi to 
as of that date  
table of contents we borrowed an aggregate amount of approximately million under the senior credit facility to fund the purchase of shares reported above and for general working capital purposes  and issued a letter of credit in favor of shinko for approximately million related to the equity option on shinko s remaining asi share ownership 
at any time prior to the first anniversary of the closing  and subject to the other provisions of the agreement  either shinko or aji may give notice to the other  calling for aji to purchase from shinko shares representing the remaining of outstanding capital stock of asi for a fixed payment of jpy billion approximately us million at the july exchange rate 
other debt financing arrangements 
at march   we had a two year revolving line of credit with a commercial bank  with a then current maturity date of july  we amended the line of credit during the first and third quarters of fiscal year as amended  the maximum borrowing available under the line was million  however  only million of borrowing was available to us as long as asi maintained million of aggregate available borrowing under its lines of credit in japan 
the line of credit required compliance with certain financial covenants  including a quarterly net income loss target  calculated on an after tax basis excluding depreciation  amortization and other non cash items  and a requirement that we maintain during the term of the line of credit a minimum cash and cash equivalents balance of million held in the us  at least million of which had to be maintained with the bank 
the specific amount of borrowing available under the line of credit at any time  however  could have changed based on the amount of letters of credit the amount of aggregate borrowing by asi and the cash balance held at the bank 
as of march   there was no amount outstanding under the line of credit  but the maximum borrowing had been reduced by million with the issuance of a letter of credit during november we were in compliance with all financial covenants and had available million as of march  this line of credit was terminated in july at march   asi had five revolving lines of credit with japanese banks 
these lines allow aggregate borrowing of up to billion japanese yen  or approximately million at the exchange rate as of march  as of march   asi had no outstanding balance and a total of billion available under these lines of credit 
as of march   asi had outstanding borrowings of billion japanese yen  or approximately million at the exchange rate as of march  that is recorded in short term debt 
asi s lines of credit carry original terms of six months to one year  at variable interest rates based on the tokyo interbank offered rate tibor which was percent at march  plus margins of to percent 
under the terms of certain of these lines of credit  asi generally is required to maintain compliance with certain financial covenants  including requirements to report an annual net profit on a statutory basis and to maintain at least percent of the equity reported as of its prior fiscal year end 
asi was in compliance with these covenants at march  none of these lines requires collateral and none of these lines requires guarantees from us or our subsidiaries in the event of default by asi 
in june  we amended two of these lines of credit representing billion yen  or approximately million  of borrowing capacity to extend the expiry dates to june   at which time all amounts outstanding under these lines of credit will be due and payable  unless the lines of credit are extended 
our japanese subsidiary  aji  has term loans outstanding with two japanese banks 
these loans are repayable monthly or quarterly through various dates ranging from may through may the loans carry annual interest rates between to percent and substantially all of these loans are guaranteed by the company in the united states 
as of march  aji had outstanding borrowings of billion japanese yen or approximately million  at exchange rates as of march   that are recorded as long term debt 
at march   aji had approximately million of borrowings  secured by accounts receivable balance  that are recorded as short term debt 
we lease facilities under non cancelable capital and operating leases  with expiration dates up to march 
table of contents other liquidity considerations 
since inception  we have incurred aggregate consolidated net losses of approximately million  and have incurred losses for the last five years 
in recent years  we have funded our operations primarily from cash generated from the issuance of debt or equity securities 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments aggregated million at march  we believe that our current cash position and the availability of additional financing via existing lines of credit will be sufficient to meet our expected cash requirements for at least the next months 
our borrowing arrangements require that we comply with certain financial covenants 
while we expect to meet such financial covenants  we cannot give absolute assurance that we will meet these financial covenants  including those contained in the senior secured credit facility 
specifically  we are required to maintain compliance with covenants establishing minimum ebitda operating performance by the company as a ratio of our total borrowing available under the senior secured credit facility 
our failure in any fiscal quarter to meet this and other covenant requirements could result in a reduction of our permitted borrowing under the facility  an acceleration of certain repayment obligations  and or an event of default which  if uncured by us or not waived by the lenders  under the terms of the facility  would require the acceleration of all re payment obligations under the facility 
alternatively  due to the cyclical and uncertain nature of cash flows and collections from our customers  the company s borrowings to fund operations or working capital could exceed the permitted total leverage ratios under the credit agreement 
under any such scenario  the company may be required pay down the outstanding borrowings from cash to maintain compliance with its financial covenants 
if we are unable to meet any such covenants or pay down outstanding borrowings as required  we cannot assure the requisite lenders will grant waivers and or amend the covenants  or that the requisite lenders will not terminate the credit agreement  preclude further borrowings or require us to repay immediately in full any outstanding borrowings 
accordingly  our ability to fund operations and working capital requirements through additional borrowing may be substantially impaired and limit our ability to grow our company or sustain or improve profitability 
the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry makes it very difficult for us to predict future liquidity requirements with certainty 
any upturn in the semiconductor industry may result in short term uses of cash in operations as cash may be used to finance additional working capital requirements such as accounts receivable and inventories 
alternatively  continuation or further softening of demand for our products may cause us to fund additional losses in the future 
at some point in the future we may require additional funds to support our working capital and operating expense requirements or for other purposes 
we may seek to raise these additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings  or the sale of assets 
these financings may not be available to us on a timely basis  if at all  or  if available  on terms acceptable to us or not dilutive to our shareholders 
if we fail to obtain acceptable additional financing  we may be required to reduce planned expenditures or forego investments  which could reduce our revenues  increase our losses  and harm our business 
nasdaq delisting proceedings on june   the company notified the nasdaq national market renamed the nasdaq global market on july  that asyst would not file its form k for the year ended march   within the calendar day extension period contemplated by its form b filed with the sec on june  on june   the company received a letter from the nasdaq listing qualifications department indicating that  because of the company s previously announced delay in timely filing its annual report on form k for its fiscal year ended march   the company was not in compliance with the filing requirements for continued listing on nasdaq as set forth in nasdaq marketplace rule c 
the company made a request for a hearing before a nasdaq listings qualifications panel to address the filing delay  which hearing was held on august  on september   the company received a letter from the nasdaq listing qualifications hearings department stating that a nasdaq listing qualifications panel has determined to continue the listing of asyst s common stock on the nasdaq global market  subject to the conditions that on or before september   the company submits supplemental information outlined in the letter concerning the previously announced special committee inquiry into stock option grants and practices  and on or before november   the company files its form k for the fiscal year ended march   its form q for the quarter ended june   and all required restatements if any 
on september   asyst submitted to nasdaq the supplemental information requested from the company 

table of contents as a result of the late filing of this form k for the fiscal year  we will be ineligible to register our securities on form s for sale by us or resale by others for one year 
the inability to use form s could adversely affect our ability to raise capital during this period 
if we failed to timely file a future periodic report with the sec and were delisted  it could severely impact our ability to raise future capital and could have an adverse impact on our overall future liquidity 
however  we are still eligible to register our securities on form s in addition  the matters we have reported in this item under overview internal control matters and in item a of this form k may also have an adverse impact on our ability to obtain future capital from equity or debt 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any financial partnerships with unconsolidated entities established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes  such as entities referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities 
accordingly  we are not exposed to any financing or other risks that could arise if we had such relationships 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at march   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands payments due by period less than more than total year years years years short term loans and notes payable long term debt  including interest capital lease obligations  including interest operating lease obligations purchase obligations defined benefit pension plan obligations total only non cancelable purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are included in the table above 
as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements  we are liable  as part of the original asi acquisition in fiscal year  to provide funding for plan benefits under asi s pension plan 
as of march  and  the liability was million and million  respectively 
as more fully described in note to the consolidate financial statements  on june   we entered into an agreement to acquire from shinko the remaining asi shares we did not already own 
this purchase increased our consolidated ownership of asi to at the closing on july   while shinko retained ownership of a equity interest 
at any time as of the first anniversary of the closing  and subject to the other provisions of the agreement  either shinko or we may give notice to the other calling for us to purchase from shinko this remaining equity for a fixed payment of jpy billion approximately us million at the june exchange rate 
under certain circumstances  shinko can accelerate upon thirty days written notice this purchase obligation 
these circumstances include a when our equity ownership in asi falls below  b when bankruptcy or corporate reorganization proceedings are filed against us or our subsidiary aji which holds ownership of the shares in asi  c when a merger or corporate reorganization has been approved involving all or substantially all of the company s assets  d when shinko s equity ownership in asi falls below  or e when the company has failed to make any payment when due in respect of any loan secured by a pledge of the company s right  title and interest in and to the shares of asi and the holder of such security interest elects to exercise its rights against aji in respect of such shares 

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
our investment portfolio consists of short term fixed income securities and by policy we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
as stated in our investment policy  we ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in safe and high credit quality securities and by periodically positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer  guarantor or depository 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
these securities  like all fixed income instruments  carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities have their fair market value adversely affected by rising interest rates 
as a result of the relatively short duration of our portfolio  an immediate hypothetical parallel shift to the yield curve of plus basis points bps  and bps would result in a reduction of percent in the market value of our investment portfolio as of march  we also have the ability to keep our fixed income investments fairly liquid 
therefore  we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by a sudden change in market interest rates on our investment portfolio 
the company adopted a foreign exchange policy that documented how we intend to comply with the accounting guidance under sfas no 
under the policy there are guidelines that permit the company to have hedge accounting treatment under both fair value and cash flow hedges 
the policy approval limits are up to million with the cfo s approval and over million with the additional approval of the ceo 
the table below presents principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates for the investment portfolio at march  as a general matter  our intent is not to hold investments longer than twelve months remaining principal weighted average maturities amount interest rate in thousands cash equivalents institutional money market funds within year  commercial paper within year  total cash equivalents short term investments auction rate securities within years  corporate debt securities within year  federal agency notes within year total short term investments the auction rate securities in the tables above have a reset feature by nature  that the interest rates of these securities are reset at least monthly 
foreign currency exchange risk 
we engage in international operations and transact business in various foreign countries 
the primary source of foreign currency cash flows is japan and to a lesser extent china  taiwan  singapore and europe 
although we operate and sell products in various global markets  substantially all sales are denominated in us dollars  except in japan 
to date  the foreign currency transactions and exposure to exchange rate volatility have not been significant 
although we do not anticipate any significant fluctuations  there can be no assurance that foreign currency exchange risk will not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flow in the future 
the following table presents our net loss  assuming a hypothetical strengthening of the japanese yen by percent and percent  respectively  compared to the average rate used during the fiscal year ended march  in thousands strengthening in japanese no change in yen of x percent japanese yen exchange rate net income loss for the fiscal year ended march
