effect of inflation inflation affects the company in two principal ways 
first  the company s debt  if any  is generally tied to the prime and libor rates so that increases affecting interest rates may be translated into additional interest expense 
second  general inflation impacts prices paid for labor  parts and supplies 
whenever possible  the company attempts to cover increased costs of production and capital by adjusting the prices of its products 
however  the company generally does not attempt to negotiate inflation based price adjustment provisions into its contracts 
since order lead times can be as much as six months  the company has limited ability to pass on cost increases to its customers on a short term basis 
in addition  the markets served by the company are competitive in nature  and competition limits the pass through of cost increases in many cases 
the company strives to minimize the effect of inflation through cost reductions and improved productivity

however  the company does have the ability to draw on this line of credit  which could result in a potential interest rate risk 
based on the company s historical borrowings  a change of in interest rates would not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position 
the company does not enter into market risk sensitive instruments for trading or other purposes 
the company does not believe that there has been a material change in the nature or categories of the primary market risk exposures or the particular markets that present the primary risk of loss to the company 
as of the date of this report  the company does not know of or expect any material changes in the general nature of its primary market risk exposure in the near term
