table of contents discussion of critical accounting policies in the ordinary course of business  the company has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial position in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
the company believes that the following discussion addresses the company s most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company s consolidated financial position and results and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition portfolio assets on january   firstcity adopted the provisions of sop as defined under effect of new accounting standards 
for loan portfolios acquired prior to january   firstcity designated these loans as non performing portfolio assets or performing portfolio assets 
such designation was made at the acquisition of the pool and does not change even though the actual performance of the loans may change 
firstcity accounts for all nonperforming loans acquired after in accordance with sop following is a description of each classification and the related accounting policy accorded to each portfolio type 
loans acquired prior to non performing portfolio assets non performing portfolio assets consist primarily of distressed loans and loan related assets  such as foreclosed upon collateral 
accounting for non performing portfolios is on a pool basis as opposed to an individual asset by asset basis 
prior to january   portfolio assets were designated as non performing if a majority of all of the loans in the portfolio were significantly under performing in accordance with the contractual terms of the underlying loan agreements at the date of acquisition 
net gain on resolution of non performing portfolio assets is recognized as income to the extent that proceeds collected exceed a pro rata portion of allocated cost from the pool 
cost allocation is based on a proration of actual proceeds divided by total estimated proceeds of the pool 
no interest income is recognized separately on non performing portfolio assets 
all proceeds  of whatever type  are included in proceeds from resolution of portfolio assets in determining the gain on resolution of such assets 
all non performing portfolio assets are purchased at discounts from their outstanding legal principal amount  the total of the aggregate of expected future sales prices and the total payments to be received from obligors 
subsequent to acquisition  the adjusted cost of non performing portfolio assets is evaluated for impairment on a quarterly basis 
the evaluation of impairment is determined based on the review of the estimated future cash receipts  which represents the net realizable value of the non performing pool 
once it is determined that there is impairment  a valuation allowance is established for any impairment identified through provisions charged to operations in the period the impairment is identified 
the company recorded no allowance for impairment   in and  in the actual future proceeds of the pool could vary materially from the estimated proceeds of the pool due to changes in economic conditions  deterioration of collateral values  deterioration in the borrower s financial condition and other conditions described in the risk factors discussed earlier in this document 
in the event that the actual future proceeds of the pool exceed the current estimates  the reported future results of the company could be higher than anticipated and would result in a higher net gain on resolution of non performing portfolio assets 
in the event that actual future proceeds of the pool are less than current estimates  the reported future results of the company could be lower than anticipated and would result in lower net gain on resolution of non performing portfolio assets or possibly require the company to recognize impairment in the value of the pool 

table of contents performing portfolio assets performing portfolio assets consist primarily of portfolios of loans acquired at a discount from the aggregate amount of the borrowers obligation 
prior to january   performing portfolio assets were accounted for using the interest method acquisition discounts for the portfolio as a whole are accreted as an adjustment to yield over the estimated life of the portfolio 
performing portfolio assets are carried at the unpaid principal balance of the underlying loans  net of acquisition discounts and allowance for loan losses 
significant increases in expected future cash flows may be recognized prospectively through an upward adjustment of the internal rate of return irr over a portfolio s remaining life 
any increase to the irr then becomes the new benchmark for impairment testing 
income on performing portfolio assets is accrued monthly based on each loan pool s effective irr 
cash flows greater than the interest accrual will reduce the carrying value of the pool 
likewise  cash flows that are less than the accrual will increase the carrying balance 
the irr is estimated and periodically recalculated based on the timing and amount of anticipated cash flows using the company s proprietary collection model 
gains are recognized on the performing portfolio assets when sufficient funds are received to fully satisfy the obligation on loans included in the pool  either from funds from the borrower or sale of the loan 
the gain recognized represents the difference between the proceeds received and the allocated carrying value of the individual loan in the pool 
the actual future cash flows of the pool could vary materially from the expected future cash flows of the pool due to changes in economic conditions  changes in collateral values  deterioration in the borrowers financial condition  restructure or renewal of individual loans in the pool  sale of loans within the pool and other conditions described in the risk factors discussed earlier in this document 
in the event that the actual future cash flows of the pool exceed the current estimates  the reported future results of the company could be higher than anticipated and would result in a higher level of interest income due to greater amounts of discount accretion being included in revenue derived from the performing portfolio assets as well as higher gains recognized on the sale of individual loans from a pool 
in the event that actual future cash flows of the pool are less than current estimates  the reported future results of the company could be lower than anticipated and would result in a lower level of interest income and reduced gains from the sale of assets from a pool  lower levels of interest income as a result of lower amounts of discount accretion being included in revenue derived from performing portfolio assets or possibly require the company to recognize impairment in the value of the pool due to a decline in the present value of the expected future cash flows 
impairment of loans acquired prior to management s best estimate of irr as of january   is the basis for subsequent impairment testing 
if it is probable that all cash flows estimated at acquisition plus any changes to expected cash flows arising from changes in estimates after acquisition would not be collected  the carrying value of a pool would be written down to maintain the then current irr 
prior to january   impairment charges would be taken to the income statement with a corresponding write off of the receivable balance 
consequently  no allowance for loan loss was recorded prior to january  the company recorded provision for impairment of loans in the amounts of  in   in and  in a pool can become fully amortized zero carrying balance on the balance sheet while still generating cash collections 
in this case  all cash collections are recognized as revenue when received 
additionally  the company uses the cost recovery method when timing and amount of collections on a particular pool of accounts cannot be reasonably predicted 
under the cost recovery method  no revenue is recognized until the company has fully collected the cost of the portfolio  or until such time that the company considers the collections to be probable and estimable and begins to recognize income based on the interest method as described above 

table of contents loans acquired after loans acquired with credit deterioration at acquisition  firstcity reviews each loan to determine whether there is evidence of deterioration of credit quality since origination and if it is probable that firstcity will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the loan s contractual terms 
if both conditions exist  firstcity determines whether each such loan is to be accounted for individually or whether such loans will be assembled into pools of loans based on common risk characteristics including loan type  collateral type  geographical location  performance status and borrower relationship 
firstcity considers expected prepayments  and estimates the amount and timing of undiscounted expected principal  interest  and other cash flows expected at acquisition for each loan and each subsequently aggregated pool of loans 
firstcity determines the excess of the loan s or pool s scheduled contractual principal and contractual interest payments over all cash flows expected at acquisition as an amount that should not be accreted nonaccretable difference 
the excess of the loan s cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition over the initial investment in the loan or pool is accreted into interest income over the remaining life of the loan or pool accretable yield 
over the life of the loan or pool  firstcity continues to estimate cash flows expected to be collected 
firstcity evaluates at the balance sheet date whether the present value of its loans determined using the effective interest rates has decreased below book value and if so  a valuation allowance is established for any impairment identified through provisions charged to operations in the period the impairment is identified 
the present value of any subsequent increase in the loan s or pool s actual cash flows or cash flows expected to be collected is used first to reverse any existing valuation allowance for that loan or pool 
any remaining increases in the present value of cash flows expected to be collected will be used to recalculate the amount of accretable yield recognized on a prospective basis over the pool s remaining life 
firstcity establishes valuation allowances for all acquired loans subject to sop to reflect only those losses incurred after acquisition that is  the present value of cash flows expected at acquisition that are not expected to be collected 
loans acquired with no credit deterioration loans acquired without evidence of credit deterioration at acquisition for which firstcity has the positive intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future are classified as held for investment and reported at their unpaid principal balance net of unamortized purchase discounts or premiums 
interest accrual ceases when payments become days contractually past due 
an allowance for loan losses is established when a loan becomes impaired 
a loan is impaired when full payment under the loan terms is not expected 
management estimates the allowance balance required using past loan loss experience  the nature and volume of the portfolio  information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values  economic conditions  and other factors 
allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans  but the entire allowance is available for any loan that  in management s judgment  should be charged off 
loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes that the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed 
at december   the company had established a valuation allowance of  on these loans 
real estate portfolios real estate portfolios consist of real estate acquired from a variety of sellers 
such portfolios are carried at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated costs to sell 
costs relating to the development and improvement of real estate for its intended use are capitalized  whereas those relating to holding assets are charged to expense 
income or loss is recognized upon the disposal of the real estate 
rental income  net of expenses  on real estate portfolios is recognized when received 
accounting for the portfolios is on an 
table of contents individual asset by asset basis as opposed to a pool basis 
subsequent to acquisition  the amortized cost of real estate portfolios is evaluated for impairment on a quarterly basis 
the evaluation of impairment is determined based on the review of the estimated future cash receipts  net of costs to sell  which represents the net realizable value of the real estate portfolio 
impairment losses are charged to operations in the period the impairment is identified 
the company recorded impairment losses of    as of december   and  respectively 
deferred tax asset as a part of the process of preparing its consolidated financial statements  the company is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
this process involves estimating the company s actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effects of future changes in tax laws or changes in tax rates are not anticipated 
the measurement of deferred tax assets  if any  is reduced by the amount of any tax benefits that  based on available evidence  are not expected to be realized 
as a result of the merger  the company has substantial federal nols that can be used to offset the tax liability associated with the company s pre tax earnings until the earlier of the expiration or utilization of such nols 
the company accounts for the benefit of the nols by recording the benefit as an asset and then establishing an allowance to value the net deferred tax asset at a value commensurate with the company s expectation of being able to utilize the recognized benefit in the foreseeable future 
such estimates are reevaluated on a quarterly basis with the adjustment to the allowance recorded as an adjustment to the income tax expense generated by the quarterly operating results 
significant events that change the company s view of its currently estimated ability to utilize the tax benefits result in substantial changes to the estimated allowance required to value the deferred tax benefits recognized in the company s periodic consolidated financial statements 
the company s analysis resulted in no change in  and the company has a net deferred tax asset of million in the consolidated balance sheet as of december   which is composed of a gross deferred tax asset of million net of a valuation allowance of million 
as discussed in note of the consolidated financial statements  firstcity sold its remaining interest in drive in november the ultimate realization of the resulting net deferred tax asset is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income from its continuing operations prior to expiration of the net operating loss carryforwards 
although realization is not assured  management believes that the deferred tax asset  net of allowance  has been carried at low levels  and thus  the sale of drive has no impact on firstcity s ability to realize all of the deferred tax asset  net of allowance 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable  however  could be adjusted in the future if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period change 
the ability of the company to realize the deferred tax asset is periodically reviewed and the valuation allowance is adjusted accordingly

risk factors 
equity investments in acquisition partnerships firstcity accounts for its investments in acquisition partnerships and their general partners using the equity method of accounting 
this accounting method generally results in the pass through of its pro rata share of earnings from the partnerships activities as if it had a direct investment in the underlying portfolio assets held by the partnerships 
the revenues and earnings of the partnerships are determined on a basis consistent with the accounting methodology applied to portfolio assets as described in the preceding 
table of contents paragraphs 
firstcity has ownership interests in the various partnerships that range from to 
the company also holds investments in servicing entities that are accounted for under the equity method 
distributions of cash flow from the acquisition partnerships are a function of the terms and covenants of the loan agreements related to the secured borrowings of the acquisition partnerships 
generally  the terms of the underlying loan agreements permit some distribution of cash flow to the equity partners so long as loan to cost and loan to value relationships are in compliance with the terms and covenants of the applicable loan agreement 
once the secured borrowings of the acquisition partnerships are fully paid  all cash flow in excess of operating expenses is available for distribution to the equity partners 
discontinued operations discontinued operations are comprised of two components previously reported as the company s residential and commercial mortgage banking business and the consumer lending business conducted through firstcity s minority interest investment in drive 
in november  firstcity completed the sale of its interest in drive  and as of december   the company had zero assets remaining from the discontinued consumer operations  but certain income realized from such operations 
the only asset remaining from discontinued mortgage operations is an investment security resulting from the retention of a residual interest in a securitization transaction 
this security is in run off  and the company is contractually obligated to service this asset 
prior to the fourth quarter of  firstcity classified these securities as held to maturity and considered the estimated future gross cash receipts for such investment securities in the computation of the value of such investment securities 
in the fourth quarter of  firstcity s management elected to pursue a strategy to liquidate these assets and carry them as held for sale 
consequently  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the remaining security is recorded at the lower of their carrying value or fair value less cost to sell 
the cash flows are collected over a period of time and are valued using a discount rate of and prepayment assumptions of for fixed rate loans and for variable rate loans 
overall loss rates are estimated at of collateral 
the assumptions used in the valuation model consider both industry as well as the company s historical experience and are reviewed quarterly in light of historical evidence in revising the prospective results of the model 
these revised assumptions could potentially result in either an increase or decrease in the estimated cash receipts 
an additional provision is booked based on the output of the valuation model if deemed necessary 
the company recorded provisions of 
million in  million in and 
million in for additional losses from discontinued mortgage operations 
in  the provision primarily relates to firstcity adjusting the carrying value of the residual interests to fair value 
the additional provision in and primarily related to a decrease in the estimated future gross cash receipts on residual interests in securitizations as a result of the actual losses exceeding the losses projected by the valuation model 
estimates of future cash receipts the company uses estimates to determine future cash receipts from portfolio assets 
these estimates of future cash receipts from acquired portfolio asset pools are utilized in four primary ways i to calculate the allocation of cost of sales of non performing portfolios  ii to determine the effective yield of performing portfolios  iii to determine the reasonableness of settlement offers received in the liquidation of the portfolio assets  and iv to determine whether or not there is impairment in a pool of portfolio assets 

table of contents calculation of the estimates of future cash receipts the company uses a proprietary asset management software program to manage the portfolio assets it owns and services 
each asset within a pool is analyzed by an account manager who is responsible for analyzing the characteristics of each asset within a pool 
the account manager projects future cash receipts and expenses related to each asset and the sum of which provides the total estimated future cash receipts related to a particular purchased asset pool 
these estimates are routinely monitored by the company to determine reasonableness of the estimates provided 
risks associated with these estimates the company has in the past been able to establish with reasonable accuracy the estimated future cash receipts over the life of a purchased asset pool 
changes in economic conditions  fluctuations in interest rates  deterioration of collateral values  and other factors described in the risk factors section could cause the estimates of future cash flows to be materially different than actual cash receipts 
the effects of an increase in the estimated future cash receipts would generally increase revenues from portfolio assets by increasing gross profit on a non performing or real estate pool and increasing the effective yield on a performing or sop portfolio while a decrease in future cash receipts would generally have the effect of reducing revenues by reducing gross profit on a non performing or real estate pool and creating impairment on a performing or sop portfolio 
in some cases a reduction in the total future cash receipts by collecting those cash receipts sooner than expected could have a positive impact on the company s revenues from portfolio assets due to reduced interest expense and other carrying costs associated with the portfolio assets 
likewise an increase in future cash receipts  although generally a positive trend  could have a negative impact on future revenues of the company if collected over a longer period  resulting in higher levels of interest expense and other carrying costs of the portfolios negating any potentially positive effects 
consolidation policy the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all of the majority owned subsidiaries of the company 
all significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation 
investments in to owned affiliates are accounted for on the equity method since the company has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies of those affiliates 
for domestic acquisition partnerships  the company owns a limited partner interest and generally shares in a general partner interest 
regarding the foreign investments  the company participates as a limited partner 
in all cases  the company s direct and indirect equity interest never exceeds 
investments in less than owned affiliates are also accounted for on the equity method 
these investments are partnerships formed to share in the risks and rewards in developing new markets as well as to pool resources 
also  the company has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies  despite its comparatively smaller equity percentage  due to its leading role in the formation of these partnerships as well as its involvement in the day to day management activities 
in december  the fasb issued a revision to interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin r  which was originally issued in january fin r provides guidance on the consolidation of certain entities when control exists through other than voting or similar interests and was effective immediately with respect to entities created after january  for certain special purpose entities created prior to february   fin r became effective for financial statements issued after december  for all other entities created prior to february   fin r became effective january  fin r requires consolidation by the primary beneficiary of expected losses or residual gains of the activities of a variable interest entity vie 
firstcity holds significant variable interests in certain 
table of contents acquisition partnerships  which would be characterized as vie s 
however  firstcity is not deemed to be the primary beneficiary of any of these entities based on the criteria set forth in fin r 
at december  firstcity s maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with the vie s is million 
equity earnings in most of the foreign acquisition partnerships are recorded on a one month lag due to the timing of firstcity s receipt of those financial statements 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following tables present contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments of the company as of december  see notes  and of the notes to consolidated financial statements dollars in thousands

the company will utilize the prospective method 
therefore  on january   the company began recognizing an expense for unvested share based compensation that has been issued 
unvested compensation cost at january  to be expensed prospectively based on unvested stock options at that date outstanding was approximately million 
on june   the fasb ratified the consensus reached by emerging issues task force eitf on issue no 
 determining whether a general partner  or the general partners as a group  controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights eitf 
the consensus reached by the eitf at the june meeting was that a sole general partner is presumed to control a limited partnership or similar entity and should consolidate the limited partnership unless the limited partners possess substantive kick out rights or the limited partners possess substantive participating rights

eitf is effective for all new and modified agreements effective june  for pre existing agreements that are not modified  the eitf is effective as of the beginning of the first fiscal reporting period beginning after december  the adoption of eitf had no impact on the company s results of operations or financial position 
in july  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no  accounting for changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
sfas 
under the provisions of sfas  a voluntary change in accounting principle requires retrospective application to prior period financial statements  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
a change in depreciation  amortization  or depletion method for long lived  nonfinancial assets must be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle 
the guidance contained in opinion no 
for reporting the correction of an error in previously issued financial statements and a change in accounting estimate was not changed 
sfas was adopted by the company as of january  and had no impact on the consolidated financial position or earnings 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
the company s operations are materially impacted by net gains on sales of loans and net interest margins 
the level of gains from loan sales the company achieves is dependent on demand for the products originated 
net interest margins are dependent on the company s ability to maintain the spread or interest differential between the interest it charges the customer for loans and the interest the company is charged for the financing of those loans 
the following describes each component of interest bearing assets held by the company and how each could be affected by changes in interest rates 
the company invests in portfolio assets both directly through consolidated subsidiaries and indirectly through equity investments in acquisition partnerships 
portfolio assets consist of investments in pools of non homogenous assets that predominantly consist of loan and real estate assets 
earnings from these assets are based on the estimated future cash flows from such assets and recorded when those cash flows occur 
the underlying loans within these pools bear both fixed and variable rates 
due to the non performing nature and history of these loans  changes in prevailing benchmark rates such as the prime rate or libor generally have a nominal effect on the ultimate future cash flow to be realized from the portfolio assets 
loans receivable consist of investment loans made to acquisition partnerships and bear interest at predominately fixed rates 
the collectibility of these loans is directly related to the underlying portfolio assets of those acquisition partnerships  which are non performing in nature 
therefore  changes in benchmark rates would have minimal effect on the collectibility of these loans 
additionally  the company has various sources of financing which have been previously described in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources

loans receivable are shown in the table based upon the expected date of sale or repayment  which could occur much faster or slower than anticipated 
equity investments are shown based on anticipated equity disbursements  which could occur much faster or slower than anticipated 
equity investments have the same type of interest bearing assets and liabilities as wholly owned subsidiaries 
notes payable mature in the periods indicated 
this does not necessarily indicate when the outstanding balances would be paid 
notes payable secured by portfolio assets fund up to of the corresponding asset class 
if the asset balance declines whether through a sale or a payment from the borrower  the corresponding liability must be paid 
the company currently has investments in europe and latin america ie mexico  argentina and dominican republic 
in europe  the company s investments are in the form of equity and represent a significant portion of the company s total equity investments 
as of december   one us dollar equaled 
euros 
a sharp change of the euro relative to the us dollar could materially adversely affect the financial position and results of operations of the company 
a and incremental depreciation of the euro would result in an estimated decline in the valuation of the company s equity investments in europe of approximately million and million  respectively 
these amounts are estimates of the financial impact of a depreciation of the euro relative to the us dollar 
consequently  these amounts are not necessarily indicative of the actual effect of such changes with respect to the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
as discussed above  the revolving acquisition facility with bank of scotland for million allows loans to be made in euros up to a maximum amount in euros that is equivalent to million us dollars 
at december   the company had million in euro denominated debt for the purpose of hedging a portion of the net equity investments in europe 
management of the company feels that this loan agreement will help reduce the risk of adverse effects of currency changes on euro denominated investments 

table of contents in mexico  approximately of the company s investments are made through us dollar denominated loans to the partnerships located in mexico 
the remaining investment is in the form of equity in these same partnerships 
the loans receivable are required to be repaid in us dollars 
although the us dollar balance of these loans will not change due to a change in the mexican peso  the future estimated cash flows of the underlying assets in mexico could become less valuable as a result of a change in the exchange rate for the mexican peso  and thus could affect the overall total returns to the company on these investments 
as of december   one us dollar equaled mexican pesos 
a and incremental depreciation of the mexican peso would result in an estimated decline in the valuation of the company s total investments in mexico of approximately 
million and million  respectively 
these amounts are estimates of the financial impact of a depreciation of the mexican peso relative to the us dollar 
consequently  these amounts are not necessarily indicative of the actual effect of such changes with respect to the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
firstcity has loans and equity investments in south america primarily from argentine acquisition partnerships 
as of december   one us dollar equaled argentine pesos 
the company estimates that a and incremental depreciation of the argentine peso would result in a decline in the valuation of the company s total investments in argentina of approximately 
million and 
million  respectively 
these amounts are estimates of the financial impact of a depreciation of the argentine peso relative to the us dollar 
consequently  these amounts are not necessarily indicative of the actual effect of such changes with respect to the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations
