these forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties  including  without limitation  those discussed below 
accordingly  sparton s future results may differ materially from historical results or from those discussed or implied by these forward looking statements 
the company notes that a variety of factors could cause the actual results and experience to differ materially from anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the company s forward looking statements 
sparton  as a high mix  low to medium volume supplier  provides rapid product turnaround for customers 
high mix describes customers needing multiple product types with generally low volume manufacturing runs 
as a contract manufacturer with customers in a variety of markets  the company has substantially less visibility of end user demand and  therefore  forecasting sales can be problematic 
customers may cancel their orders  change production quantities and or reschedule production for a number of reasons 
depressed economic conditions may result in customers delaying delivery of product  or the placement of purchase orders for lower volumes than previously anticipated 
unplanned cancellations  reductions  or delays by customers may negatively impact the company s results of operations 
as many of the company s costs and operating expenses are relatively fixed within given ranges of production  a reduction in customer demand can disproportionately affect the company s gross margins and operating income 
the majority of the company s sales have historically come from a limited number of customers 
significant reductions in sales to  or a loss of  one of these customers could materially impact business if the company were not able to replace those sales with new business 
other risks and uncertainties that may affect operations  performance  growth forecasts and business results include  but are not limited to  timing and fluctuations in us and or world economies  competition in the overall ems business  availability of production labor and management services under terms acceptable to the company  congressional budget outlays for sonobuoy development and production  congressional legislation  foreign currency exchange rate risk  uncertainties associated with the costs and benefits of new facilities  including the plant in vietnam and the company s newest subsidiary astro instrumentation  inc  and the closing of others  uncertainties associated with the outcome of litigation  changes in the interpretation of environmental laws and the uncertainties of environmental remediation  and uncertainties related to defects discovered in certain of the company s aerospace circuit boards 
further risk factors are the availability and cost of materials 
a number of events can impact these risks and uncertainties  including potential escalating utility and other related costs due to natural disasters  as well as political uncertainties such as the conflict in iraq 
the company has encountered availability and extended lead time issues on some electronic components in the past when market demand has been strong  this resulted in higher prices and late deliveries 
additionally  the timing of sonobuoy sales to the us navy is dependent upon access to the test range and successful passage of product tests performed by the us navy 
reduced governmental budgets have made access to the test range less predictable and less frequent than in the past 
finally  the sarbanes oxley act of required changes in  and formalization of  some of the company s corporate governance and compliance practices 
the sec and new york stock exchange nyse also passed rules and regulations requiring additional compliance activities 
compliance with these rules has increased administrative costs  and it is expected that certain of these costs will continue indefinitely

management cautions readers not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements  which are subject to influence by the enumerated risk factors as well as unanticipated future events

industrial and other market sales  which include gaming sales  increased from the same period last year 
this increase was attributed to increased demand from two existing customers 
sales to the aerospace markets continued to grow  increasing over the prior year 
in general  this reflected stronger demand in the commercial aerospace market  primarily increased demand for products related to aircraft collision avoidance systems mandated for installation in all commercial aircraft 
approximately million of the aerospace increase was attributable to increased orders from one customer  to which the company supplies product to several separate manufacturing facilities 
medical scientific instrumentation sales declined from the prior year 
this decrease resulted from overall lower demand from existing customers in this market area  as well as new program delays 
sales to our six largest customers  including government sales  accounted for approximately and of net sales in fiscal and  respectively

results for fiscal were impacted by severe tropical storms in florida during the period

this unexpected activity  along with the minor damage that was experienced and unproductive wages  resulted in costs of sparton corporation annual report 
table of contents approximately  being charged in the first quarter of fiscal  the majority of which were included in cost of goods sold 
fiscal s gross profit also included a settlement with a customer in the second quarter of fiscal  which resulted in the company s recovery of  of prior period start up expenses 
fiscal s depressed margin reflects the inclusion of costs on the start up phase of several major programs  as well as final charges incurred at the completion of one sonobuoy contract that had experienced technical problems 
in addition  fiscal s margin included a redesign effort on an existing product line  which resulted in a charge to operations of  gross margin was further reduced in and by charges of  and  respectively  for obsolete inventory at two locations 
the company continued to experience underutilized capacity which  due to the fixed nature of many of the company s costs  continued to negatively impact margins 
finally  pension costs decreased  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal this decrease in pension costs was due to an increase in the expected return on pension assets and reduced amortization costs related to unrecognized actuarial losses 
the majority of pension costs are charged to cost of goods sold 
spartronics vietnam officially began operations in may included in fiscal results were the operations from the company s new vietnam facility  which startup adversely impacted gross margin by  the lowered selling and administrative expenses were primarily the result of decreased bid and proposal and research and development expenses for fiscal  which were approximately million below prior year 
these cost reductions were not indicative of reduced bid and proposal activity  but primarily the result of a one time sonobuoy engineering project in fiscal which has been completed 
operating income also includes charges related to the new mexico environmental remediation effort  principally legal fees  of  in fiscal and  in fiscal in addition  fiscal includes  pre tax of income related to the company s settlement with previous insurance carriers  which reflected a recovery of a portion of past costs the company incurred in its investigation and site remediation of its coors road facility

table of contents liquidity and capital resources the primary source of liquidity and capital resources has historically been generated from operations 
certain government contracts provide for interim progress billings based on costs incurred 
these progress billings reduce the amount of cash that would otherwise be required during the performance of these contracts 
as the volume of us defense related contract work has declined over the past several years  so has the relative importance of progress billings as a liquidity resource 
at the present time  the company plans on using its investment securities to provide working capital  invest in additional property  plant and equipment  and to strategically accommodate growth 
growth is expected to be achieved through internal expansion and or acquisition or joint venture 
in addition  the company s previously announced  stock repurchase program is expected to utilize a portion of the company s investments 
through june   approximately  shares  at a cost of approximately  have been repurchased 
these repurchased shares have been retired 
for the fiscal year ended june   cash and cash equivalents decreased  to  operating activities provided   and  in fiscal  and  respectively  in net cash flows 
the primary source of cash in fiscal resulted from the receipt of  in cash from a legal settlement  which occurred in fiscal additionally  collection of receivables  reflective of the high amount of sales in june of fiscal  also contributed to cashflow 
the primary use of cash in fiscal was a net settlement in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
the change in this area between fiscal and is primarily due to the payment of million in income taxes payable from fiscal  as well as payment for the increase in inventory and other liabilities recorded at june  the primary source of cash in was from operations  after reduction for the non cash income related to a legal settlement  plus the increase in accounts payable and other accruals 
partially offsetting this was an increase in accounts receivable reflecting higher government sales in june the legal settlement resulted in the company s recognition of  of income  the receipt of which occurred in july the primary source of cash in fiscal  which reflected a net loss  was from collection of accounts receivable 
the fiscal decrease in accounts receivable was reflective of the receipt of payments for the large volume of sales recognized in june the change in cash flow related to inventory and prepaid expenses between fiscal and was reflective of a large increase at june  of inventory due to delayed customer delivery schedules  as well as increased inventory for new customer contracts 
inventory levels at june   reflected a decline  as these customers schedules were no longer delayed  as well as the start of several new customer contracts 
in fiscal  the increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities was primarily due to income taxes payable 
in fiscal  the company  due to its loss position  recorded an income tax receivable 
fiscal cash flow from operations also includes an other net reduction of  including two separate transactions 
the first  reflecting a reduction in operating cash flow  relates to a claim for an amount due of  in fiscal  an increase of  from fiscal  from a vendor for defective circuit boards supplied to us  the resolution of which the company is currently pursuing with the board s manufacturer 
this amount  reflecting prior accounts receivable and inventory and associated expenses  is included in other long term assets 
the second  reflecting an increase in operating cash flow  includes a  settlement and collection from a customer for past costs and inventory which  due to the age of the claim  had been included in other long term assets 
cash flows used by investing activities totaled   and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
cash was primarily used for the purchase of astro  as well as the purchase of property  plant and equipment  which is discussed below 
included in the company s balance sheet as of june   is construction in progress of approximately  towards the construction of astro s new  square foot addition 
total cost for this expanded production space is anticipated to be million 
the purchase of  and proceeds from the sale and maturities of  investment securities are generally reflective of activity within the various investment options  with the net purchases position representing the investment of excess cash generated from operations in fiscal in fiscal  net proceeds from the sale and maturities of investments were also used to fund the astro acquisition 
in fiscal and  net proceeds from the sale and maturities of investments were also used to fund purchases of property  plant and equipment 
cash flows provided by financing activities were   and  in fiscal  and  respectively  primarily in fiscal from the issuance of debt related to the acquisition of astro  and reflecting in all three fiscal years presented the exercise of stock options 
cash flows used by financing activity in fiscal were primarily from the repurchase of company stock and the payment of a per share cash dividend which is further discussed below 
historically  the company s market risk exposure to foreign currency exchange and interest rates on third party receivables and payables has not been considered to be material  principally due to their short term nature and the minimal amount of receivables and payables designated in foreign currency 
however  due to the strengthened canadian dollar  the impact of transaction and translation gains on intercompany activity and balances has increased 
if the exchange rate were to materially change  the company s financial position could be significantly affected 
the company currently has an unused formal line of credit totaling million and a bank loan totaling million 
in addition  there are notes payable totaling million outstanding to the former owners of astro 
these borrowings are discussed below 
sparton corporation annual report 
table of contents at june  and  the aggregate government funded ems backlog was approximately million and million  respectively 
a majority of the june   backlog is expected to be realized in the next months 
commercial ems orders are not included in the backlog 
the company does not believe the amount of commercial activity covered by firm purchase orders is a meaningful measure of future sales  as such orders may be rescheduled or cancelled without significant penalty 
the company signed a membership purchase agreement and completed the acquisition of astro on may  astro s sales volume for the year ended december   was approximately million 
the purchase price was approximately million  plus the extinguishment by sparton at closing of million in seller credit facilities and the assumption of million in bonded debt 
the purchase price was funded using a combination of cash  million in bank debt  and million in notes payable to astro s previous owners sellers 
additional contingent consideration may be paid to the sellers over the four years based on of astro s earnings before interest  depreciation  and taxes as defined  and if paid will be added to goodwill 
under the terms of the purchase agreement  the prior owners entered into non competition agreements with the company 
astro is an ems provider that designs and manufactures a variety of specialized medical products  generally involving high quality medical laboratory test equipment 
astro operates from a  square foot facility in an industrial park 
a  square foot addition to the facility is now under construction 
sparton now operates the business as a wholly owned subsidiary at its present location and with the current operating management and staff 
a further discussion of the astro purchase is contained in notes and to the consolidated financial statements included in item the company is continuing a program of identifying and evaluating potential acquisition candidates in both the defense and medical markets 
construction of the company s spartronics plant in vietnam was completed and production began in may this facility is anticipated to provide increased growth opportunities for the company  in current as well as new markets 
as the company has not previously done business in this emerging market  there are many uncertainties and risks inherent in this venture 
to date  the company s total investment approximates million  which includes land  building  and initial operating expenses  with approximately million having been expended for the construction of the new facility  primarily in fiscal as with the company s other facilities  the majority of the equipment utilized in production operations is leased 
the company purchased a manufacturing facility in albuquerque  new mexico in december for approximately million 
this facility replaced an existing plant in rio rancho  new mexico 
the costs of remodeling and facility upgrades approximated million and were incurred  primarily in  as the company transitioned between facilities 
the rio rancho plant was sold in june for approximately million million after expenses related to the sale  resulting in a  gain 
the company leased the rio rancho facility until the transition to the new facility was completed in december the new facility provides a much more efficient manufacturing space 
in the first quarter of fiscal  a per share cash dividend  totaling approximately  was paid to shareowners on october  subsequently in october  the company declared a stock dividend 
this dividend was distributed january   to shareowners of record on december  at june   the company had  in shareowners equity per share   in working capital  and a working capital ratio 
the company believes it has sufficient liquidity for its anticipated needs over the next months  unless an additional significant business acquisition were to be identified and completed for cash 
contractual obligations the company s current obligations  which are due within twelve months  for the payment of accounts payable  accruals  and other liabilities totaled  at june   and includes the  and  respectively  for the current portions of our long term debt and environmental liability  respectively  and  of the standby letters of credit 
these obligations are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets in item the following tables summarize the company s significant contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of june  payments due by fiscal period contractual obligations total thereafter long term debt  including interest payments operating leases environmental liabilities noncancelable purchase orders total sparton corporation annual report 
table of contents amount of commitment by fiscal expiration period other commercial commitments total thereafter standby letters of credit long term debt payments include principal and interest for both short term and long term debt  including a million bank loan  notes totaling million payable to the previous owners of astro  and industrial revenue bond obligations  which were assumed by sparton at the time of purchase 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for further discussion on borrowings 
operating leases see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for further discussion of operating leases 
environmental liabilities see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for a description of the accrual for environmental remediation 
of the  total accrued   is classified as a current liability and  is classified as a long term liability  both of which are included on the balance sheet as of june  noncancelable purchase orders binding orders the company has placed with suppliers that are subject to quality and performance requirements 
standby letters of credit the company has standby letters of credit outstanding of approximately  at june   principally to support self insured programs  certain foreign sales contracts  and a portion of the industrial revenue bonds assumed from astro 
approximately  of the potential liabilities related to these letters of credit are reflected as accrued liabilities on the company s june  balance sheet 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported as assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
estimates are regularly evaluated and are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap and does not require management s judgment in application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies as discussed in note included to the consolidated financial statements  which is included in item  the following involve a higher degree of judgement and complexity 
senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with sparton s audit committee of the board of directors 
environmental contingencies one of sparton s former manufacturing facilities  located in albuquerque  new mexico coors road  has been the subject of ongoing investigations and remediation efforts conducted with the environmental protection agency epa under the resource conservation and recovery act rcra 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item  sparton has accrued its estimate of the minimum future non discounted financial liability 
the estimate was developed using existing technology and excludes legal and related consulting costs 
the minimum cost estimate includes equipment  operating and monitoring costs for both onsite and offsite remediation 
sparton recognizes legal and consulting services in the periods incurred and reviews its epa accrual activity quarterly 
uncertainties associated with environmental remediation contingencies are pervasive and often result in wide ranges of reasonably possible outcomes 
it is possible that cash flows and results of operations could be materially affected by the impact of changes in these estimates 
government contract cost estimates government production contracts are accounted for based on completed units accepted with respect to revenue recognition and their estimated average cost per unit regarding costs 
losses for the entire amount of the contract are recognized in the period when such losses are determinable 
significant judgment is exercised in determining estimated total contract costs including  but not limited to  cost experience to date  estimated length of time to contract completion  costs for materials  production labor and support services to be expended  and known issues on remaining units to be completed 
in addition  estimated total contract costs can be significantly affected by changing test routines and procedures  resulting sparton corporation annual report 
table of contents design modifications and production rework from these changing test routines and procedures  and limited range access for testing these design modifications and rework solutions 
estimated costs developed in the early stages of contracts can change  sometimes significantly  as the contracts progress  and events and activities take place 
changes in estimates can also occur when new designs are initially placed into production 
the company formally reviews its costs incurred to date and estimated costs to complete on all significant contracts at least quarterly and revised estimated total contract costs are reflected in the financial statements 
depending upon the circumstances  it is possible that the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected by changes in estimated costs to complete on one or more significant contracts 
commercial inventory valuation allowances inventory valuation allowances for commercial customer inventories require a significant degree of judgment and are influenced by the company s experience to date with both customers and other markets  prevailing market conditions for raw materials  contractual terms and customers ability to satisfy these obligations  environmental or technological materials obsolescence  changes in demand for customer products  and other factors resulting in acquiring materials in excess of customer product demand 
contracts with some commercial customers may be based upon estimated quantities of product manufactured for shipment over estimated time periods 
raw material inventories are purchased to fulfill these customer requirements 
within these arrangements  customer demand for products frequently changes  sometimes creating excess and obsolete inventories 
the company regularly reviews raw material inventories by customer for both excess and obsolete quantities  with adjustments made accordingly 
wherever possible  the company attempts to recover its full cost of excess and obsolete inventories from customers or  in some cases  through other markets 
when it is determined that the company s carrying cost of such excess and obsolete inventories cannot be recovered in full  a charge is taken against income and a valuation allowance is established for the difference between the carrying cost and the estimated realizable amount 
conversely  should the disposition of adjusted excess and obsolete inventories result in recoveries in excess of these reduced carrying values  the remaining portion of the valuation allowances are reversed and taken into income when such determinations are made 
it is possible that the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected by changes to inventory valuation allowances for commercial customer excess and obsolete inventories 
allowance for probable losses on receivables the accounts receivable balance is recorded net of allowances for amounts not expected to be collected from customers 
the allowance is estimated based on historical experience of write offs  the level of past due amounts  information known about specific customers with respect to their ability to make payments  and future expectations of conditions that might impact the collectibility of accounts 
accounts receivable are generally due under normal trade terms for the industry 
credit is granted  and credit evaluations are periodically performed  based on a customer s financial condition and other factors 
although the company does not generally require collateral  cash in advance or letters of credit may be required from customers in certain circumstances  including some foreign customers 
when management determines that it is probable that an account will not be collected  it is charged against the allowance for probable losses 
the company reviews the adequacy of its allowance monthly 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was  and  at june  and  respectively 
if the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payment  additional allowances may be required 
given the company s significant balance of government receivables and letters of credit from foreign customers  collection risk is considered minimal 
historically  uncollectible accounts have generally been insignificant and the minimal allowance is deemed adequate 
pension obligations the company calculates the cost of providing pension benefits under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions 
the key assumptions required within the provisions of sfas no 
are used in making these calculations 
the most significant of these assumptions are the discount rate used to value the future obligations and the expected return on pension plan assets 
the discount rate is consistent with market interest rates on high quality  fixed income investments 
the expected return on assets is based on long term returns and assets held by the plan  which is influenced by historical averages 
if actual interest rates and returns on plan assets materially differ from the assumptions  future adjustments to the financial statements would be required 
while changes in these assumptions can have a significant effect on the pension benefit obligation and the unrecognized gain or loss accounts disclosed in the notes to the financial statements  the effect of changes in these assumptions is not expected to have the same relative effect on net periodic pension expense in the near term 
while these assumptions may change in the future based on changes in long term interest rates and market conditions  there are no known expected changes in these assumptions as of june  as indicated above  to the extent the assumptions differ from actual results or if there are changes made to accounting standards for these costs  there would be a future impact on the financial statements 
the extent to which this sparton corporation annual report 
table of contents will result in future expense is not determinable at this time as it will depend upon a number of variables  including trends in interest rates and the actual return on plan assets 
during the quarter ended march   the annual actuarial valuation of the pension plan was completed 
based on this valuation  net periodic pension expense for fiscal was determined to be  compared to  for fiscal the components of net periodic pension expense are detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
no cash payments are expected to be required prior to due to the plan s funded status 
business combinations in accordance with accepted business combination accounting  the company allocated the purchase price of its recent astro acquisition to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values 
the company engaged an independent  third party appraisal firm to assist management in determining the fair value of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
such valuations require management to make significant estimates  judgments and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
management arrived at estimates of fair value based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable 
these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired business and are inherently uncertain 
critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected discounted cash flows from customer relationships and contracts assuming similar product platforms and completed projects  the acquired company s market position  as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired customer relationships will continue to generate revenue streams  and attrition and discount rates 
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions  estimates or actual results  particularly with respect to amortization periods assigned to identifiable intangible assets 
goodwill and customer relationships the company currently reviews goodwill associated with its cybernet investment on a regular basis for possible impairment 
additionally  the company will review goodwill and customer relationships  associated with the recent astro acquisition  for impairment annually  with the first review anticipated to occur in april possible impairment of these assets will also be reviewed should events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the provisions of sfas no 
require that a two step impairment test be performed on intangible assets 
in the first step  the company compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the unit  goodwill is considered not impaired and the company is not required to perform further testing 
if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  then management will perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then the company would record an impairment loss equal to the difference 
determining the fair value of any reporting entity is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates  operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows  risk adjusted discount rates  future economic and market conditions and  if appropriate  determination of appropriate market comparables 
the company bases its fair value estimates on assumptions believed to be reasonable  but which are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
in addition  the company makes certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of the company s reporting units 
the most recent annual goodwill impairment analysis related to the company s cybernet investment  which was performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal  did not result in an impairment charge

table of contents uncertainties associated with environmental remediation contingencies are pervasive and often result in wide ranges of reasonably possible outcomes 
estimates developed in the early stages of remediation can vary significantly 
normally  a finite estimate of cost does not become fixed and determinable at a specific point in time 
rather  the costs associated with environmental remediation become estimable over a continuum of events and activities that help to frame and define a liability 
it is possible that cash flows and results of operations could be affected significantly by the impact of the ultimate resolution of this contingency 
some of the printed circuit boards supplied to the company for its aerospace sales have been discovered to be defective 
the defect occurred during production at the raw printed circuit board suppliers facility  prior to shipment to sparton for further processing 
sparton  the board manufacturer  electropac co  inc  and our customer  who received the defective boards  have contained the defective boards 
while investigations are underway  million of related product and associated expenses have been classified in sparton s balance sheet within other long term assets as of june  in august  sparton electronics florida  inc filed an action in us district court of florida against electropac co  inc to recover these costs 
the likelihood that the claim will be resolved and the extent of sparton s exposure  if any  is unknown at this time 
no loss contingency has been established at june  sparton is currently involved with legal actions  which are disclosed in part i item legal proceedings  of this report 
at this time  the company is unable to predict the outcome of these claims 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk exposure the company manufactures its products in the united states  canada  and vietnam 
sales are to the us and canada  as well as other foreign markets 
the company is potentially subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to intercompany activity and balances and to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers in foreign currencies 
also  adjustments related to the translation of the company s canadian and vietnamese financial statements into us dollars are included in current earnings 
as a result  the company s financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or economic conditions in the domestic and foreign markets in which the company operates 
however  minimal third party receivables and payables are denominated in foreign currency and the related market risk exposure is considered to be immaterial 
historically  foreign currency gains and losses related to intercompany activity and balances have not been significant 
however  due to the strengthened canadian dollar  the impact of transaction and translation gains has increased 
if the exchange rate were to materially change  the company s financial position could be significantly affected 
the company has financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk  principally short term investments 
historically  the company has not experienced material gains or losses due to such interest rate changes 
based on the current holdings of short term investments  the interest rate risk is not considered to be material
