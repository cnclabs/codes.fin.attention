impairment of long lived assets we evaluate goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a carrying amount may not be fully recoverable 
long lived assets  including property and equipment  long term assets and amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable 
conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset  a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used or a significant adverse change that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets is not recoverable 
we assess impairment in accordance with the requirements of sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we assess the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with the provisions of sfas no

the company periodically evaluates and  if necessary  adjusts the estimates based on currently available information 
investments sfas  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and sab  accounting for non current marketable equity securities  provide guidance on determining when an investment is other than temporarily impaired 
we review investments quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment 
each determination requires significant judgment 
in making a judgment  we evaluate  among other factors  the duration and extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost  the financial health of the investee  and our intent and ability to hold the investment 
investments with an indicator are further evaluated to determine the likelihood of a significant adverse effect on the fair value and amount of the impairment as necessary 
if market  industry and or investee conditions deteriorate  we may incur future impairments

change in fair value of warrant liability 
our initial liability related to warrants outstanding from our preferred stock and subordinated convertible debenture offerings  and is adjusted to fair market value at the end of each reporting period 
the million gain for the year ended december  was due to a decrease in the fair market value of the warrants outstanding  which reduced the corresponding liability  and the amendment to the registration rights agreement related to the debentures and the warrants  which enabled us to reclassify the warrant liability of million related to the debentures as additional paid in capital 
the decrease in the fair market value of the warrants was primarily due to the lower fair market value of our common stock at december   as compared to the fair market value of our common stock at the time we issued the warrants

this condition has been met  and management believes the holder may exercise its right to require redemption 
management believes existing cash and investments will be sufficient to meet the obligation to redeem  should the holder exercise its right 
the company maintains cash balances at the subsidiary level to meet short term capital requirements and to satisfy local statutory liquidity requirements 
these requirements  as well as local tax implications  may limit the amount of capital that can be repatriated from certain subsidiaries 
these funds are freely available to the subsidiaries for operational purposes 
specifically  kk search has million in cash as of december  that must be kept in japan for operational purposes 
we continue to increase capital expenditures and operating lease commitments  which is consistent with our increased staffing and operational expansion  and we anticipate this will continue in the future as business conditions merit

of the total valuation allowance of million at december   tax benefits recognized in the future of approximately of million will be applied directly to additional paid in capital 
this amount relates to the tax effect of employee stock option deductions included in our net operating loss carryforward 
the company is subjected to routine tax examinations by taxing authorities at the federal  state and local levels in the us and by various levels in foreign countries 
as of december   there are several reviews being conducted and management is of the opinion that the ultimate outcome of these examinations would not have a material adverse impact on the financial position of the company or the results of its operations 
off balance sheet arrangements common stock warrants issued in conjunction with our subordinated convertible debentures are equity linked derivatives and accordingly represent off balance sheet arrangements 
in addition  the conversion and redemption features of the subordinated convertible debentures constitute an embedded derivative 
some of the common stock warrants and the conversion and redemption features meet the scope exception in paragraph a of the statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  and are accordingly not accounted for as derivatives for purposes of sfas  but instead are accounted for as equity

impact of recently issued accounting standards stock based compensation in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued the revised sfas no 
 share based payment sfas r  which addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions in which a company obtains employee services in exchange for a equity instruments of the company or b liabilities that are based on the fair value of the company s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
sfas r eliminates the ability to account for employee share based payment transactions using accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 and requires  instead  that such transactions be accounted for using the grant date fair value based method 
sfas r will be effective as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  however  the sec amended the compliance dates to make sfas r effective for the first fiscal year following june  january  for the company 
sfas r applies to all awards granted or modified after the effective date of the statement 
in addition  compensation cost for the unvested portion of previously granted awards that remain outstanding on the effective date shall be recognized on or after the effective date  as the related services are rendered  based on the awards grant date fair value as previously calculated for the pro forma disclosure under sfas r 
we expect that  upon the adoption of sfas r  we will apply the modified prospective application transition method  as permitted by the statement 
under such transition method  upon the adoption of sfas r  our financial statements for periods prior to the effective date of the statement will not be restated 
the impact of this statement on our financial statements and our results of operations in and beyond will depend upon various factors  among them  our future compensation strategy 
we expect the effect of applying sfas r to our results of operations for  as they relate to existing option plans  would not be materially different from the pro forma effects reported under the disclosure requirements of sfas item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations 
interest rate risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve capital 
cash and cash equivalents are investments with original maturities of three months or less 
therefore  changes in the market s interest rates do not affect the value of the investments as recorded by real media 
the following table presents the amounts of our financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk by expected maturity and average interest rates as of december  in thousands  except percentages thereafter total cash and cash equivalents average interest rate due to the short term nature of our cash and cash equivalents  the amount presented represent the fair value as of december  foreign currency risk international revenues accounted for approximately of our total revenues during  as compared to during the growth in our international operations has increased our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations 
revenues and related expenses generated from our international subsidiaries are generally denominated in the functional currencies of the local countries 
primary currencies include euros  british pounds  japanese yen  korean won  canadian dollars and australian dollars 
the income statements of our international operations are translated into us dollars at the average exchange rates in each applicable period 
to the extent the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies  the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions results in increased revenues  operating expenses and net income for our foreign operations 
similarly  our revenues  operating expenses and net income will decrease for our international segments when the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies 
realized foreign currency transaction gains losses included in other income in the consolidated statements of operations were immaterial for the years ended december   and we expect to use the assets denominated in foreign currencies for project execution expenditures in the currency in which they are held  the risk of realized translation losses is mitigated 
we considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that changes in exchange rates of for all currencies could be experienced in the near term 
these changes would have resulted in an immaterial impact on income loss before provision for income taxes and minority interest in operations of consolidated subsidiary for the years ended december  and december
