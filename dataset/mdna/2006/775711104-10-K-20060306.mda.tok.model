requires curtailment accounting if an event eliminates  for a significant number of employees  the accrual of defined benefits for some or all of their future services

as a result  the effective tax rate for the year increased to  as compared to in critical accounting policies the company views critical accounting policies to be those policies that are very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  and that require management s most difficult  complex or subjective judgments 
the circumstances that make these judgments difficult or complex relate to the need for management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we believe our critical accounting policies to be as follows accrual for termite contracts the company maintains an accrual for termite claims representing the estimated costs of reapplications  repairs and associated labor and chemicals  settlements  awards and other costs relative to termite control services 
factors that may impact future cost include chemical life expectancy and government regulation 
it is significant that the actual number of claims has decreased in recent years due to changes in the company s business practices 
however  it is not possible to precisely predict future significant claims 
positive changes to our business practices include revisions made to our contracts  more effective treatment methods that include a directed liquid and baiting program  more effective termiticides  and expanding training 
accrued insurance the company self insures  up to specified limits  certain risks related to general liability  workers compensation and vehicle liability 
the estimated costs of existing and future claims under the self insurance program are accrued based upon historical trends as incidents occur  whether reported or unreported although actual settlement of the claims may not be made until future periods and may be subsequently revised based on developments relating to such claims 
the company contracts an independent third party actuary on an annual basis to provide the company an estimated liability based upon historical claims information 
the actuarial study is a major consideration  along with management s knowledge of changes in business practices and existing claims compared to current balances 
the reserve is established based on all these factors 
due to the uncertainty associated with the estimation of future loss and expense payments and inherent limitations of the data  actual developments may vary from the company s projections 
this is particularly true since critical assumptions regarding the parameters used to develop reserve estimates are largely based upon judgment 
therefore  changes in estimates may be sufficiently material 
management s judgment is inherently subjective and a number of factors are outside management s knowledge and control 
additionally  historical information is not always an accurate indication of future events 
it should be noted that the number of claims has been decreasing due to the company s proactive risk management to develop and maintain ongoing programs 
initiatives that have been implemented include pre employment screening and an annual motor vehicle report required on all its drivers  utilization of a global positioning system that has been fully deployed to our company vehicles  post offer physicals for new employees  and pre hire  random and post accident drug testing 
the company has improved the time required to report a claim by utilizing a red alert program that provides serious accident assessment twenty four hours a day and seven days a week and has instituted a modified duty program that enables employees to go back to work on a limited duty basis 
revenue recognition the company s revenue recognition policies are designed to recognize revenues at the time services are performed 
for certain revenue types  because of the timing of billing and the receipt of cash versus the timing of performing services  certain accounting estimates are utilized 
residential and commercial pest control services are primarily recurring in nature on a monthly or bi monthly basis  while certain types of commercial customers may receive multiple treatments within a given month 
in general  pest control customers sign an initial one year contract  and revenues are recognized at the time services are performed 
for pest control customers  the company offers a discount for those customers who prepay for a full year of services 
the company defers recognition of these advance payments and recognizes the revenue as the services are rendered 
the company classifies the discounts related to the advance payments as a reduction in revenues 
termite baiting revenues are recognized based on the delivery of the individual units of accounting 
at the inception of a new baiting services contract upon quality control review of the installation  the company recognizes revenue for the delivery of the monitoring stations  initial directed liquid termiticide treatment and installation of the monitoring services 
the amount deferred is the fair value of monitoring services to be rendered after the initial service 
the amount deferred for the undelivered monitoring element is then recognized as income on a straight line basis over the remaining contract term  which results in recognition of revenue in a pattern that approximates the timing of performing monitoring visits 
baiting renewal revenue is deferred and recognized over the annual contract period on a straight line basis that approximates the timing of performing the required monitoring visits 
prior to  traditional termite treatments were recognized as revenue at the renewal date and an accrual was established for estimated costs of reapplications and repairs to be incurred 
under the newly adopted accounting method  the revenue received is deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the remaining contract term  and  the cost of reinspections  reapplications and repairs and associated labor and chemicals are expensed as incurred 
for outstanding claims  an estimate is made of the costs to be incurred including legal costs based upon current factors and historical information 
the performance of reinspections tends to be close to the contract renewal date and  while reapplications and repairs involve an insubstantial number of the contracts  these costs are incurred over the contract term 
the newly adopted accounting principle eliminates the need to obtain actuarial estimates of the claim costs to be incurred and management s estimates of reapplication costs 
also  management believes the newly adopted accounting method more closely conforms to the current pattern under which revenues are earned and expenses are incurred  and conforms the accounting methodology of orkin and its recently acquired subsidiary  western pest services 
the costs of providing termite services upon renewal are compared to the expected revenue to be received and a provision is made for any expected losses 
due to this change  the company recorded a cumulative adjustment of million net of income taxes 
as the revenue is being deferred  the future cost of reinspections  reapplications and repairs and associated labor and chemicals applicable to the deferred revenue are expensed as incurred and no longer accrued 
the company will continue to accrue for noticed claims 
contingency accruals the company is a party to legal proceedings with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies  the company estimates and accrues for its liability and costs associated with the litigation 
estimates and accruals are determined in consultation with outside counsel 
it is not possible to accurately predict the ultimate result of the litigation 
however  in the opinion of management  the outcome of the litigation will not have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
stock based compensation in december  the fasb issued a revision of statement of financial accounting standards or fas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
the revision is referred to as fas r share based payment or fas r  which supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  or apb and will require companies to recognize compensation expense  using a fair value based method  for costs related to share based payments including stock options and stock issued under our employee stock plans 
we will adopt fas r using the modified prospective basis on january  our adoption of fas r is expected to result in compensation expense that will reduce diluted net income per share by approximately per share for however  our estimate of future stock based compensation expense is affected by our stock price  as well as a number of complex and subjective valuation assumptions and the related tax effect 
these valuation assumptions include  but are not limited to  the volatility of our stock price and employee stock option exercise behaviors

the company maintains million of credit facilities with commercial banks  of which no borrowings were outstanding as of december  or february  the company maintains approximately million in letters of credit  which reduced its borrowing capacity under the credit facilities 
these letters of credit are required by the company s fronting insurance companies and or certain states  due to the company s self funded status  to secure various workers compensation and casualty insurance contracts 
these letters of credit are established by the bank for the company s fronting insurance companies as collateral  although the company believes that it has adequate liquid assets  funding sources and insurance accruals to accommodate such claims

we will adopt fas r using the modified prospective basis on january  our adoption of fas r is expected to result in compensation expense that will reduce diluted net income per share by approximately per share for however  our estimate of future stock based compensation expense is affected by our stock price  as well as a number of complex and subjective valuation assumptions and the related tax effect 
these valuation assumptions include  but are not limited to  the volatility of our stock price and employee stock option exercise behaviors 
in may  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
 accounting changes and error corrections sfas which replaces apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and fasb statement no
