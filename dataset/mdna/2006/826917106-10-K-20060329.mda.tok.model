item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes to those statements and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
in addition to historical information  the following discussion and other parts of this annual report contain forward looking information that involves risks and uncertainties 
overview since our inception in december  we have been principally engaged in the research and development of novel products for the prevention and treatment of serious infectious diseases  including products for use in the defense against biological warfare agents such as smallpox and arenaviruses 
the effort to develop a drug for smallpox is being aided by sbir grants from the nih totaling approximately million that were awarded in the third quarter of  an agreement with saint louis university  funded by the nih that was signed in september  and a million contract with the us army which began in january the arenavirus program is being supported by sbir grants from the nih totaling approximately million that were awarded in the third quarter of our anti viral programs are designed to prevent or limit the replication of the viral pathogen 
our anti infectives programs are aimed at the increasingly serious problem of drug resistance 
these programs are designed to block the ability of bacteria to attach to human tissue  the first step in the infection process 
we are also developing a technology for the mucosal delivery of our vaccines which may allow the vaccines to activate the immune system at the mucus lined surfaces of the body the mouth  the nose  the lungs and the gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts the sites of entry for most infectious agents 
we do not have commercial biomedical products  and we do not expect to have such products for one to three years  if at all 
we believe that we will need additional funds to complete the development of our biomedical products 
our plans with regard to these matters include continued development of our products as well as seeking additional research support funds and financial arrangements 
although we continue to pursue these plans  there is no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining sufficient financing on terms acceptable to us 
the financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty 
management believes it has sufficient funds and projected cash flows to support operations beyond march  our biotechnology operations are based in our research facility in corvallis  oregon 
we continue to seek to fund a major portion of our ongoing antiviral  antibiotic and vaccine programs through a combination of government grants and strategic alliances 
while we have had success in obtaining strategic alliances and grants  there is no assurance that we will continue to be successful in obtaining funds from these sources 
until additional relationships are established  we expect to continue to incur significant research and development costs and costs associated with the manufacturing of product for use in clinical trials and pre clinical testing 
it is expected that general and administrative costs  including patent and regulatory costs  necessary to support clinical trials and research and development will continue to be significant in the future 
to date  we have not marketed  or generated revenues from the commercial sale of any products 
our biopharmaceutical product candidates are not expected to be commercially available for several years  if at all 
accordingly  we expect to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future 
there can be no assurance that we will ever achieve profitable operations 
critical accounting estimates the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements  which we discuss under the heading results of operations following this section of our md a 
some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our most critical accounting estimates include the assessment of recoverability of goodwill  which could impacts goodwill impairments  the assessment of recoverability of long lived assets  which primarily impacts operating income if impairment exists 
below  we discuss these policies further  as well as the estimates and judgments involved 
other key accounting policies  including revenue recognition  are less subjective and involve a far lower degree of estimates and judgment 
significant accounting policies the following is a brief discussion of the more significant accounting policies and methods used by us in the preparation of our financial statements 
note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of all of the significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue from contract research and development and research progress payments in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  sab 
in accordance with sab  revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed and determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured  contractual obligations have been satisfied and title and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer 
the company recognizes revenue from non refundable up front payments  not tied to achieving a specific performance milestone  over the period which the company is obligated to perform services or based on the percentage of costs incurred to date  estimated costs to complete and total expected contract revenue 
payments for development activities are recognized as revenue is earned  over the period of effort 
substantive at risk milestone payments  which are based on achieving a specific performance milestone  are recognized as revenue when the milestone is achieved and the related payment is due  providing there is no future service obligation associated with that milestone 
in situations where the company receives payment in advance of the performance of services  such amounts are deferred and recognized as revenue as the related services are performed 
goodwill goodwill is recorded when the purchase price paid for an acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired 
the company performs an annual review in the fourth quarter of each year  or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist  to determine if the carrying value of the recorded goodwill is impaired 
goodwill impairment is determined using a two step approach in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
the impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which goodwill resides to its carrying value 
in  the company operated as one business and one reporting unit 
therefore  the goodwill impairment analysis was performed on the basis of the company as a whole using the market capitalization of the company as an estimate of its fair value 
the estimated fair values might produce significantly different results if other reasonable assumptions and estimates were to be used 
identified intangible assets acquisition related intangibles include acquired technology  customer contracts  grants and covenants not to compete  and are amortized on a straight line basis over periods ranging from years 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  the company performs a review of its identified intangible assets to determine if facts and circumstances exist which indicate that the useful life is shorter than originally estimated or that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable 
if such facts and circumstances do exist  the company assesses the recoverability of identified intangible assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their remaining lives against their respective carrying amounts 
impairment  if any  is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas r  which requires the company to recognize compensation expense for stock options granted to employees based on the estimated fair value of the equity instrument at the time of grant 
currently  the company discloses the pro forma net income and earnings per share as if the company applied the fair value recognition provisions of sfas as amended by fas the requirements of sfas r are effective for the company in the first quarter of fiscal we will recognize compensation expense for stock based awards issued after january  on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award 
we also expect to record expense of approximately  and  in fiscal and related to previously issued  unvested stock options 
siga will continue to use the black scholes model for evaluating the fair market value of its stock options 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error correction a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas changes the requirements for the accounting for and the reporting of a change in accounting principle 
sfas requires that a voluntary change in accounting principle be applied retroactively with all prior period financial statements presented using the new accounting principle 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors in fiscal years beginning after december  we will apply the requirements of sfas on any changes in principle made on or after january  results of operations the following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of income data as a percentage of net revenue for the periods indicated revenue selling  general and administrative research and development patent preparation fees in process research and development impairment of intangible assets operating loss years ended december   and revenues for the years ended december  and were  and  respectively 
the increase of  or from the year ended december  related to the award of two phase i and two phase ii sbir grants by the nih during the third quarter of  an agreement with saint louis university entered into in september  and an agreement with usamrmc entered into in september the grants awarded by the nih during the third quarter of to support our smallpox and arenaviruses programs are for a two year period ending in the third quarter of the total award for these grants was million 
for the years ended december  and we recorded revenues of million and million  respectively  from these grants  mainly reflecting the continued development of our smallpox oral antiviral drug 
in  we also received a one year sbir grant from the nih for  to support our strep vaccine program 
in and we recorded revenue of  and  respectively  from this grant 
on september   we entered into an agreement with saint louis university for the continued development of one of our smallpox drugs 
the agreement is funded through the nih 
under the agreement  siga will receive approximately million during the term of september  to february  revenues are recognized as services are performed 
in  we recognized revenues of  from the agreement 
on september   we entered into a million  one year contract with usamrmc 
the agreement  for the rapid identification and treatment of anti viral diseases  is funded through the usaf the usaf agreement 
advance payments under the usaf agreement  received prior to the performance of services  are deferred and recognized as revenue when the related services are performed 
in  we recognized revenues of  from the usaf agreement 
for the years ended december  and revenue from our contract with the us army was  and  in we recognized revenue of  from an sbir grant for our degp anti infective that we completed in the second quarter of revenues of  for the year ended december  increased million compared to  recognized for the year ended december  the increase resulted from the award of two phase i and two phase ii sbir grants by the nih during the third quarter of for the year ended december  we recorded revenue of  from these grants 
in  we also recorded  from the nih grant awarded to us in august of to support our strep vaccine program 
revenue from our contract with the us army was  for  compared to  for the year ended december  the approximate increase was due to the higher budget for work performed in for the year ended december  we received revenue of  from an sbir grant for our degp anti infective that we completed in the second quarter of for the year ended december  we received  from this grant 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a were  and  for the years ended december  and sg a declined million or primarily due to million decline in legal fees and  decline in consulting fees 
in  upon the re negotiation of certain legal invoices  we received and recorded credits of  in legal expenses 
in addition to the credits received by siga  legal fees declined by approximately  from the year ended december  reflecting higher legal fees during the period due to the acquisition of certain assets from viropharma  the review and amendment of our corporate governance policies and procedures to ensure compliance with sarbanes oxley act of and nasdaq requirements 
legal expenses in were also incurred in connection with the sale of certain non core vaccine assets and a legal action that the company initiated against a former founder 
in  we incurred higher consulting expenses in connection with our efforts to secure certain government contracts 
our agreement with the consulting group was terminated in october sg a expenses for the year ended december  were  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase of  or approximately  was primarily due to an increase of  in payroll expense  and a  increase in legal expenses 
payroll expenses increased by approximately primarily due to the addition of a chief executive officer and a vice president business development  bonuses paid to employees  and the costs associated with the termination of the employment agreement with our former president 
the increase in legal expenses of from was the result of the costs incurred to review and amend our corporate governance policies and procedures to ensure compliance with the regulations promulgated under the sarbanes oxley act of  as well as the nasdaq stock market 
also contributing to the increase in legal expenses were the costs incurred in connection with a potential business combination  the sale of certain non core vaccine assets  the hiring of our new ceo  a legal action that we initiated against a former founder and the work performed relative to the acquisition of certain assets and grants from viropharma 
increases in travel expense  rent  amortization and filing fees were offset by decreases in depreciation  insurance and miscellaneous expenses 
research and development r d expenses for the years ended december  and were  and  respectively 
r d expenses increased million or primarily due to preclinical development work in connection with our two lead product programs  work performed to support our recent agreements with saint louis university and the usaf  the hiring of new employees and the increase in amortization expense 
in  we incurred approximately million to support preclinical development work in connection with our smallpox and arenaviruses programs 
our research staff increased from scientists at december  to scientists at december   resulting in an increase of  in payroll and related expenses 
amortization of intangible assets in the amount of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  represented approximately of the increase 
r d expenses of  for the year ended december  increased approximately from the  of expenses incurred for the year ended december  amortization expense of  represented approximately of the increase 
these expenses were the result of the acquisition of certain assets from plexus in and viropharma in payroll expenses increased approximately to  for from  incurred in the increase was the result of the expansion of staff to service the grants acquired from viropharma and bonuses paid to employees 
sponsored research increased by approximately in to  from  in the increase was the result of payments made to a danish university for former plexus programs  a payment made to transtech pharma for work performed on an sbir grant that was completed in the second quarter and payments to oregon state university for work on the strep grant received in expenses for lab supplies increased approximately to  from  as a result of accelerated development of our lead product programs 
our product programs are in the early stage of development 
at this stage of development  we cannot make reasonable estimates of the potential cost for most of our programs to be completed or the time it will take to complete the project 
our lead product  siga  is an orally administered anti viral drug that targets the smallpox virus 
in december the fda accepted our ind application for siga and granted it fast track status 
we expect that costs to complete the program will approximate million to million  and that the project could be completed in months to months 
there is a high risk of non completion of any program  including siga  because of the lead time to program completion and uncertainty of the costs 
net cash inflows from any products developed from our programs is at least one to three years away 
however  we could receive additional grants  contracts or technology licenses in the short term 
the potential cash and timing is not known and we cannot be certain if they will ever occur 
the risk of failure to complete any program is high  as each  other than our smallpox program that is scheduled to enter phase i clinical trials in  is in the relatively early stage of development 
products for the biological warfare defense market  such as the siga smallpox anti viral  could generate revenues in one to three years 
we believe the products directed toward this market are on schedule 
we expect the future research and development cost of our biological warfare defense programs to increase as the potential products enter animal studies and safety testing  including human safety trials 
funds for future development will be partially paid for by nih sbir grants  the contract we have with the us army  additional government funding and from future financing 
if we are unable to obtain additional federal grants and contracts or funding in the required amounts  the development timeline for these products would slow or possibly be suspended 
delay or suspension of any of our programs could have an adverse impact on our ability to raise funds in the future  enter into collaborations with corporate partners or obtain additional federal funding from contracts or grants 
patent preparation expenses for the years ended december  and were  and  respectively 
the decline of  or relates to the termination of our relations with plexus and pecos labs inc pecos  and the reduction in the number of patents supported by siga  in addition to a refund of  received in from our patent legal counsel 
patent preparation expenses for the year ended december  were  compared to  incurred in the increase was the result of increased costs arising from the plexus and viropharma asset acquisitions 
for the year ended december   as a result of the acquisition of certain government grants and two early stage antiviral programs  smallpox and arenavirus  targeting certain agents of biological warfare  from viropharma   was immediately expensed as purchased in process research and development iprd 
the amount expensed as iprd was attributed to technology that has not reached technological feasibility and has no alternate future use 
the value allocated to iprd was determined using the income approach that included an excess earnings analysis reflecting the appropriate costs of capital for the purchase 
estimates of future cash flows related to the iprd were made for both the smallpox and arenavirus programs 
the aggregate discount rate of approximately utilized to discount the programs cash flows were based on consideration of the company s weighted average cost of capital  as well as other factors  including the stage of completion and the uncertainty of technology advances for these programs 
if the programs are not successful or completed in a timely manner  the company s product pricing and growth rates may not be achieved and the company may not realize the financial benefits expected from the programs 
for the year ended december  we recorded a  non cash loss on impairment of assets 
in december  upon completion of the viropharma transaction  integration of the related acquired programs into the company s operations  and the demonstrated antiviral activity of the company s lead smallpox compound against several mouse models of poxvirus disease  we commenced an application process for additional government grants to support our continued efforts under the smallpox and arenavirus antiviral programs 
we determined that significant efforts and resources will be necessary to successfully continue the development efforts under these programs and decided to allocate the necessary resources to support its commitment 
as a result  limited resources will be available for the development of future product candidates that utilize the technology acquired from plexus in may these factors resulted in a significant reduction in forecasted revenues related to that technology and a reduction in the future remaining useful life  and triggered the related intangible asset impairment 
the amount of impairment recorded by us in december was determined using the two step process impairment review as required by sfas in the first step  we compared the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the technology acquired from plexus over its remaining life against its carrying amount 
we determined that the carrying amount of the technology acquired from plexus exceeded its projected undiscounted cash flows 
in the second step  we estimated the fair value of the technology using the income method of valuation  which included the use of estimated discounted cash flows 
based on our assessment  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of approximately million in december  which was included as a component of our operating loss 
in may  we performed an impairment review of our intangible assets in accordance with sfas in connection with the sale of certain intangible assets from our immunological bioinformatics technology and certain non core vaccine development to a privately held company  pecos 
we recorded an impairment charge of  to the grants transferred to pecos and  to the covenant not to compete with our president who was terminated during the current year period 
for the year ended december   we incurred a loss on impairment of assets as a result of taking a non cash charge of  to the intangible assets acquired in the plexus transaction to reflect the termination of a research agreement 
total operating loss for the years ended december  and was  and  respectively 
operating loss in  excluding non cash charges recorded for the impairment of assets and recognition of in process r d was  the decline in total operating loss is primarily related to the increase in revenues generated during and the decline in our sg a expenses which was partially off set by the increase in r d expenses to support our programs 
total operating loss of  for the year ended december   increased  from the loss of  in  of the operating loss recognized in related to non cash charges incurred for the impairment of assets and recognition of in process research and development expense 
excluding these expenses  the loss recognized in was approximately higher than the prior year 
the increase in the loss was due to higher selling  general and administrative expenses  higher research and development expenses and higher patent costs as described in detail above 
these increases were partially offset by higher revenues 
a gain from the decrease in common stock rights and common stock warrants was recorded in connection with the sale and issuance of common stock  warrants and rights in in november  we sold  shares of the company s common stock at per share  warrants to purchase  shares of the company s common stock and rights to purchase additional shares of the company s common stock for a gross amount of  at an initial price of per share 
the warrants and rights to purchase additional common stock of siga were recorded at fair market value and classified as liabilities at the time of the transaction 
a gain of  was recorded by us  reflecting the decline in the fair value of the warrants and the rights to acquire additional shares of our common stock  from the time of the transaction to december  other income for the years ended december    and was   and  respectively 
other income in was higher than and mainly due to interest income received on higher cash balances during that year 
in we also received other income of  as the result of the settlement of a legal action with a former founder 
liquidity and capital resources as of december  we had  in cash and cash equivalents 
we believe that these funds and our anticipated cash flows  including receipt of funding from government contracts and grants  will be sufficient to support our operations beyond march  on march   siga entered into a term sheet for the merger of the company with pharmathene  inc under the provisions of the term sheet  the chief executive officer of pharmathene will serve as president and chief executive officer of the combined company and the board of directors for the new company will reflect the new proportionate ownership 
it is expected that the shareholders of siga will own approximately of the combined company  which is anticipated to remain listed on the nasdaq stock market 
the transaction is conditioned on  among other things  the execution of a definitive merger agreement  approval of the shareholders of each company  regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions 
in connection with the transaction  the company and pharmathene also entered into a bridge note purchase agreement whereby pharmathene will provide siga with up to million in interim financing 
in november  we sold  shares of our common stock at per share and warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock 
the warrants are initially exercisable at of the closing price on the closing date of the transaction per share at any time and from time to time through and including the seventh anniversary of the closing date 
the investors are also entitled to purchase additional shares of our common stock for a gross amount of  at an initial price of per share for a period of trading days following the effectiveness of a registration statement 
an initial registration statement relating to the common stock sold and the stock underlying the warrants became effective on december  with respect to the transaction  we entered into an exclusive finder s agreement 
finder s fees under the agreement include cash compensation of of the gross amount financed and a warrant to acquire  shares of our common stock at terms equal to the investors warrants 
net proceeds from the november financing were  in may   we borrowed approximately  under a promissory note payable to general electric capital corporation 
the note is payable in monthly installments of principal and interest of per annum 
the note is secured by a master security agreement dated as of april  and by specific property listed under the master security agreement 
total balance outstanding at december  was  in august  we acquired certain government grants and two early stage antiviral programs  smallpox and arenavirus  targeting certain agents of biological warfare from viropharma for a purchase price of  in cash and  shares of our common stock 
as part of the closing  we were awarded phase i and ii sbir grants from the nih totaling approximately million  which will be received over the next two years  for the development of drugs for the treatment of smallpox and arenavirus as noted above 
in  we began to expand our research facility in corvallis  oregon 
the expanded facility will accommodate the increase in our research and development staff and is expected to be completed in the second quarter of until the facility expansion is completed  the project is classified as construction in progress in property  plant and equipment 
in  we expect to incur approximately  to complete the expansion 
in may  we sold intangible assets from our immunological bioinformatics technology and certain non core vaccine development assets to a privately held company  pecos in exchange for  shares of pecos common stock 
as a result of this transaction  we performed an impairment review of the intangible assets and concluded that the carrying amount of certain transferred intangible assets of  would not be recoverable 
in addition  we terminated our employment agreement with our president 
we paid approximately  in severance to our former president as well as accelerated vesting on  stock options that were due to vest in may no compensation charge was recorded as the exercise price of the options was above the fair value market price on the date of termination 
in addition  we reduced the covenant not to compete with our former president to one year from the date of termination 
we recognized  of impairment to the unamortized covenant not to compete with our former president due to the reduction of the covenant to one year from the date of termination 
in august  we entered into an agreement with macandrews forbes  a holding company of which the company s chairman of the board of directors is vice chairman and a director 
upon consummation of the agreement  macandrews forbes and its permitted assignees invested an initial  in siga in exchange for  shares of our common stock at a price of per share and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at an initial exercise price of per share 
macandrews forbes and its permitted assignee also received an option  exercisable through october   to invest up to an additional  in siga on the same terms 
upon exercise of the option in october  we received gross proceeds of  in exchange for  shares of common stock at a price of per share and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at an initial exercise price of per share 
in january  upon approval of the company s shareholders  macandrews forbes and its permitted assignees invested the remaining  in exchange for  shares of common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
all warrants issued under the agreement have a term of seven years 
in june  the company raised gross proceeds of million in a private offering of  shares of common stock 
in connection with the offering  the company issued warrants to purchase  shares of the company s common stock to placement agents 
the warrants are exercisable at a price of per share and have a term of five years 
in may  we acquired substantially all of the assets of plexus in exchange for  shares of our common stock and the assumption of certain liabilities  including promissory notes for loans we previously made to plexus for  and  we have incurred cumulative net losses and expect to incur additional losses to perform further research and development activities 
we do not have commercial products and have limited capital resources 
our plans with regard to these matters include continued development of our products as well as seeking additional working capital through a combination of collaborative agreements  strategic alliances  research grants  equity and debt financing 
although we continue to pursue these plans  there is no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining sufficient financing on commercially reasonable terms 
our working capital and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including pharmaceutical research and development programs  pre clinical and clinical testing  timing and cost of obtaining regulatory approvals  levels of resources that we devote to the development of manufacturing and marketing capabilities  technological advances  status of competitors  and our ability to establish collaborative arrangements with other organizations 
on march   we received million under a million bridge note purchase agreement between the company and pharmathene inc we believe that our existing cash combined with anticipated cash flows  including receipt of future funding from government contracts and grants and receipt of the remaining million funding under the bridge note purchase agreement will be sufficient to support our operations beyond march   and that sufficient cash flows will be available to meet our business objectives 
we have developed a plan to further reduce the company s operating expenses in the event that sufficient funds are not available  or if we are not able to obtain funding from the bridge note purchase agreement or the anticipated government contracts and grants  which would be sufficient to enable us to operate beyond march  if we are not unable to raise adequate capital or achieve profitability  future operations will need to be scaled back or discontinued 
contractual obligations  commercial commitments and purchase obligations as of december   our purchase obligations are not material 
we lease certain facilities and office space under operating leases 
minimum future rental commitments under operating leases having non cancelable lease terms in excess of one year are as follows year ended december  total  off balance sheet arrangements siga does not have any off balance sheet arrangements
