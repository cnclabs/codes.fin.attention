item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations segment and market information at the end of fiscal we revised our segment disclosures to separately present a corrugated segment previously included in the merchandising display segment 
the corrugated segment includes our corrugated packaging operations that primarily consist of our corrugators and sheet plants 
our st 
paul recycled corrugated medium mill remains in our paperboard segment 
the financial statements presented have been reclassified to reflect this revision 
we report our results in four segments packaging products  paperboard  merchandising displays  and corrugated 
the following table shows certain operating data for our four segments 
we do not allocate certain of our income and expenses to our segments and  thus  the information that management uses to make operating decisions and assess performance does not reflect such amounts

table of contents year ended september  in millions interest and other income expense minority interest in income of consolidated subsidiaries income from continuing operations before income taxes income tax expense income from continuing operations income from discontinued operations net income overview segment income increased million in fiscal based on the performance in our two largest business segments  synergies we continue to realize from the gspp acquisition and lower fiber prices 
good demand and pricing improvements for recycled paperboard  and the full year impact of the acquisition of our bleached paperboard mill  resulted in much higher earnings in our paperboard mills and increased paperboard segment income approximately over the prior year 
sales growth in our core folding carton business and the contributions from the folding carton plants acquired in june as part of the gspp acquisition increased packaging products segment income over the prior year 
partially offsetting these improvements were increased energy costs  a mechanical failure of the white liquor clarifier at our bleached paperboard mill and operating losses at our mexico display facility that we sold in october due to capacity closures of competing coated recycled paperboard mills in fiscal we began to see improved operating rates at our coated recycled paperboard mills 
we expect this trend to continue in the near future 
we expect to realize higher prices in fiscal for recycled paperboard and corrugated medium 
our net debt as hereinafter defined  see non gaap measure below was million at september  compared to at september  we reduced net debt by million in fiscal during fiscal we paid million for the purchase of businesses and contributed million to our pension plans

net sales aggregate paperboard segment first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter fiscal year in millions the increase in paperboard segment net sales before intersegment eliminations in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to bleached paperboard and market pulp net sales from our gspp acquisition  strong demand for recycled paperboard in part due to capacity closures of competing coated recycled mills and higher pricing 
recycled paperboard tons shipped increased compared to the same period last year 
we expect to see some further price increases in the early part of fiscal as a result of price increases we previously announced 
however  the impact of announced board price increases will be dictated  in part  by market forces that determine the timing and extent of our recovery of the increases

we value the majority of our us inventories at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on the last in first out lifo  inventory valuation method  which we believe generally results in a better matching of current costs and revenues than under the first in first out fifo  inventory valuation method 
in periods of increasing costs  the lifo method generally results in higher cost of goods sold than under the fifo method 
in periods of decreasing costs  the results are generally the opposite 
the following table illustrates the comparative effect of lifo and fifo accounting on our results of operations 
this supplemental fifo earnings information reflects the after tax effect of eliminating the lifo adjustment each year

net income is higher in fiscal under the lifo method than the fifo method 
generally accepted accounting principles requires that inventory acquired in an acquisition be valued at selling price less costs to sell  dispose and complete 
this value is generally higher than the cost to manufacture inventory 
for the gspp acquisition in fiscal  the inventory value computed in this manner was million higher than the cost to manufacture 
this step up would have been expensed under the fifo method 
under our lifo inventory method  this higher cost remains in inventory until the inventory layer represented by this inventory is consumed 
to the extent inventory levels acquired in the gspp acquisition are lowered in the future  cost of goods sold could be higher than the normal cost to manufacture

approximately million of the benefit relates to the filing of amended tax returns for fiscal years and and comparable adjustments made to the fiscal tax returns 
the impact of the million was not material to our net income for any prior fiscal years  therefore  we recorded the cumulative impact in fiscal approximately million of the tax benefit in fiscal related to a reduction in a valuation allowance for net operating loss carry forwards nols and credits that we had previously concluded may not be realizable but which we determined as a result of the restructuring of our corporate entities  would be realizable in future years

we estimate that our capital expenditures will aggregate approximately million in fiscal we are obligated to purchase million of fixed assets at september  we intend to use these expenditures for the purchase and upgrading of machinery and equipment  including growth and efficiency capital focused on our folding carton business  and maintenance capital 
we believe that our financial position would support higher levels of capital expenditures  if justified by opportunities to increase revenues or reduce costs  and we continuously review new investment opportunities 
accordingly  it is possible that our capital expenditures in fiscal could be higher than currently anticipated 
we estimate that we will spend approximately million for capital expenditures during fiscal in connection with matters relating to environmental compliance 
additionally  to comply with emissions regulations under the clean air act  we may be required to modify or replace a coal fired boiler at one of our facilities  the cost 
table of contents of which we estimate would be approximately to million 
if necessary  we anticipate that we will incur those costs during fiscal and except for the approximately million we expect to remit in for the homeland investment act dividend  as a result of the step up in basis related to the acquisition of the gspp fixed assets and the associated tax depreciation from these assets  we do not anticipate paying any federal income taxes related to fiscal we do not expect cash tax payments to exceed income tax expense in fiscal we expect cash tax payments to exceed income tax expense in fiscal and  primarily as book depreciation begins to exceed tax depreciation

based on current facts and assumptions  we anticipate contributing approximately million to the us qualified plans by the end of fiscal contractual obligations we summarize in the following table our enforceable and legally binding contractual obligations at september   and the effect these obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
we based some of the amounts in this table on management s estimates and assumptions about these obligations  including their duration  the possibility of renewal  anticipated actions by third parties  and other factors

d under the terms of the seven hills joint venture agreement  our joint venture partner has the option to terminate the joint venture and require us to purchase its interest in seven hills on march   and annually thereafter at a formula price that would result in a current purchase price of less than of our joint venture partner s then current book net equity investment 
at september  we have estimated the purchase price to be approximately million 
we have not included the million in the table above 
e we have not included in the table above an item labeled other long term liabilities reflected on our consolidated balance sheet because none of our other long term liabilities have a definite pay out scheme 
as discussed in note retirement plans of the notes to consolidated financial statements  we have long term liabilities for deferred employee compensation  including pension  supplemental retirement plans  and deferred compensation 
we have not included in the table the payments related to the supplemental retirement plans and deferred compensation because these amounts are dependent upon  among other things  when the employee retires or leaves our company  and whether the employee elects lump sum or installment payments 
in addition  we have not included in the table minimum pension funding requirements because such amounts are not available for all periods presented 
we estimate that we will contribute approximately million to our five qualified defined benefit pension plans in fiscal and based on current facts and assumptions expect to contribute million to the plans by the end of fiscal during fiscal  we contributed approximately million to our five qualified defined benefit pension plans 
in addition to the enforceable and legally binding obligations quantified in the table above  we have other obligations for goods and services and raw materials entered into in the normal course of business 
these contracts  however  either are not enforceable or legally binding or are subject to change based on our business decisions

unconsolidated joint venture we own of the seven hills joint venture with our joint venture partner  and account for it under the equity method 
during fiscal our share of operating income incurred at seven hills amounted to million 
during fiscal our share of operating losses incurred at seven hills amounted to million 
the loss in fiscal reflected our estimate of our share of the adverse impact of a preliminary settlement of arbitration between us and our joint venture partner  which was recorded in the third quarter of fiscal this arbitration centered on the price we had previously charged  and could in the future charge seven hills for certain energy costs and other services  as well as the price seven hills had previously charged  and could in the future charge our joint venture partner for product sold to our joint venture partner 
the final settlement notice was received in december at that time  we determined that a portion of the adverse impact previously recorded no longer was required and the excess amount of million was released to income in the first quarter of fiscal during fiscal  our share of operating income at seven hills was million 
our pre tax income from the seven hills joint venture  including the fees we charge the venture and our share of the joint venture s net income  was million  million  and million for fiscal   and  respectively

table of contents stock repurchase program our board of directors has approved a stock repurchase plan that allows for the repurchase from time to time of shares of common stock over an indefinite period of time 
as of september   we had million shares of common stock available for repurchase under the amended repurchase plan 
pursuant to our repurchase plan  during fiscal   and  we did not repurchase any shares of common stock 
expenditures for environmental compliance for a discussion of our expenditures for environmental compliance  see item  business governmental regulation environmental regulation 
critical accounting policies and estimates we have prepared our accompanying consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles  which require management to make estimates that affect the amounts of revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities reported 
the following are critical accounting matters that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and that require some of management s most subjective and complex judgments 
the accounting for these matters involves the making of estimates based on current facts  circumstances and assumptions that  in management s judgment  could change in a manner that would materially affect management s future estimates with respect to such matters and  accordingly  could cause our future reported financial condition and results to differ materially from those that we are currently reporting based on management s current estimates 
for additional information  see note description of business and summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
see also item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk accounts receivable and allowances we have an allowance for doubtful accounts  returns and allowances  and cash discounts that serve to reduce the value of our gross accounts receivable to the amount we estimate we will ultimately collect 
the allowances contain uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and apply judgment regarding the customer s credit worthiness and the returns and allowances and cash discounts that may be taken by our customers 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our customers financial condition  our collection experience and any other relevant customer specific credit information 
our assessment of this and other information forms the basis of our allowances 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to estimate the allowances 
however  while these credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions we established  it is possible that our credit loss rates could be higher or lower in the future depending on changes in business conditions 
at september   our allowances were million  a change in our allowance would change our reserve by approximately million 
inventory we carry our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
cost includes materials  labor and overhead 
market  with respect to all inventories  is replacement cost or net realizable value  depending on the inventory 
management frequently reviews inventory to determine the necessity to markdown excess  obsolete or unsaleable inventory 
judgment and uncertainty exists with respect to this estimate because it requires management to assess customer and market demand 
these estimates may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have overstated or understated the markdown required for excess  obsolete or unsaleable inventory 
we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to markdown inventory during the past three fiscal years 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate inventory markdowns 
while these markdowns have historically been within our expectations and the markdowns we established  it is possible that our reserves could be higher or lower in the future if our estimates 
table of contents are inaccurate 
at september   our inventory reserves were million  a change in our inventory allowance would change our reserve by approximately million 
prior to the application of the lifo method  our us operations used a variety of methods to estimate the fifo cost of their finished goods inventories 
one of our divisions uses a standard cost system 
another division divides the actual cost of goods manufactured by the tons produced and multiplies this amount by the tons of inventory on hand 
other divisions calculate a ratio  on a plant by plant basis  the numerator of which is the cost of goods sold and the denominator is net sales 
this ratio is applied to the estimated sales value of the finished goods inventory 
variances and other unusual items are analyzed to determine whether it is appropriate to include those items in the value of inventory 
examples of variances and unusual items include  but are not limited to  freight  handling costs and wasted materials spoilage to determine the amount of current period charges 
cost includes raw materials and supplies  direct labor  indirect labor related to the manufacturing process and depreciation and other factory overheads 
impairment of goodwill and long lived assets we review the recorded value of our goodwill annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year  or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed fair value as set forth in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
we determine recoverability by comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill applies to the carrying value  including goodwill  of that reporting unit 
estimating the fair value of the reporting unit involves uncertainties  because it requires management to develop numerous assumptions  including assumptions about the future growth and potential volatility in revenues and costs  capital expenditures  industry economic factors and future business strategy 
the variability of the factors that management uses to perform the goodwill impairment test depends on a number of conditions  including uncertainty about future events and cash flows 
all such factors are interdependent and  therefore  do not change in isolation 
accordingly  our accounting estimates may materially change from period to period due to changing market factors 
if we had used other assumptions and estimates or if different conditions occurred in future periods  future operating results could be materially impacted 
for example  based on available information as of our most recent review during the fourth quarter of fiscal  if our net operating profit before tax had decreased by with respect to the pre tax earnings we used in our forecasts  the enterprise value of each of our divisions would have continued to exceed their respective net book values 
also  based on the same information  if we had concluded that it was appropriate to increase by basis points the discount rate we used to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit  the fair value for each of our reporting units would have continued to exceed its carrying value 
we follow statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  in determining whether the carrying value of any of our long lived assets is impaired 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on legal factors  market conditions and operational performance 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that assets associated with a particular operation are impaired 
evaluating the impairment also requires us to estimate future operating results and cash flows  which also require judgment by management 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
included in our long lived assets are certain intangible assets 
these intangible assets are amortized based on the approximate pattern in which the economic benefits are consumed over their estimated useful lives ranging from to years and have a weighted average of approximately years 
we identify the weighted average lives of our intangible assets by category in note other intangible assets of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we have not made any material changes to our impairment loss assessment methodology during the past three fiscal years 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in future assumptions or estimates we use to calculate impairment losses 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates  we may be exposed to additional impairment losses that could be material 

table of contents health insurance we are self insured for the majority of our group health insurance costs  subject to specific retention levels 
our self insurance liabilities contain uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions regarding and apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date 
we utilize historical claims lag data provided by our claims administrators to compute the required estimated reserve rate 
we calculate our average monthly claims paid utilizing the actual monthly payments during the trailing month period 
at that time  we also calculate our required reserve utilizing the reserve rates discussed above 
during fiscal  the average monthly claims paid were between million and million and our average claims lag was between and times the average monthly claims paid 
our accrual at september   represents approximately times the average monthly claims paid 
health insurance costs have risen in recent years  but our reserves have historically been within our expectations 
we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our self insured liabilities during the past three fiscal years 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future assumptions or estimates we use to calculate our self insured liabilities 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions  we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
a change in the average claims lag would change our reserve by approximately million 
workers compensation we purchase workers compensation policies for the majority of our workers compensation liabilities that are subject to various deductibles 
we calculate our workers compensation reserves based on estimated actuarially calculated development factors 
our workers compensation liabilities contain uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions regarding the injury 
we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our workers compensation liabilities during the past three fiscal years 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future assumptions or estimates we use to calculate our workers compensation liabilities 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions  we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
although the cost of individual claims may vary over the life of the claim  the population taken as a whole has not changed significantly from our expectations 
a adverse change in our development factors at september  would have resulted in an additional million of expense for the fiscal year 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we estimate our actual current tax exposure and assess temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
certain judgments  assumptions and estimates may affect the carrying value of any deferred tax assets and their associated valuation allowances  if any  and deferred tax liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 
we periodically review our estimates and assumptions of our estimated tax assets and obligations using historical experience in the jurisdictions we do business in  and informed judgments 
in addition  we maintain reserves for certain tax contingencies based upon our expectations of the outcome of tax audits in the jurisdictions where we operate 
while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our income tax expense and liabilities 
a increase in our effective tax rate would increase tax expense from continuing operations by approximately million for fiscal a increase in our estimated tax rate used to compute deferred tax liabilities and assets  as recorded on the september  consolidated balance sheet  would increase tax expense by approximately million for fiscal pension plans we have five defined benefit pension plans us qualified plans  with approximately of our employees in the united states currently accruing benefits 
in addition  under several labor contracts  we make payments based on hours worked into multi employer pension plan trusts established for the benefit of certain 
table of contents collective bargaining employees in facilities both inside and outside the united states 
the determination of our obligation and expense for pension plans is dependent on our selection of certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts 
we describe these assumptions in note retirement plans of the notes to consolidated financial statements  which include  among others  the discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets and expected rates of increase in compensation levels 
although there is authoritative guidance on how to select most of these assumptions  management must exercise some degree of judgment when selecting these assumptions 
the amounts necessary to fund future payouts under these plans are subject to numerous assumptions and variables 
certain significant variables require us to make assumptions such as a discount rate  expected rate of return on plan assets and future compensation levels 
we evaluate these assumptions with our actuarial advisors on an annual basis and we believe they are within accepted industry ranges  although an increase or decrease in the assumptions or economic events outside our control could have a direct impact on reported net earnings 
our discount rate for each plan used for determining future net periodic benefit cost is based on the citigroup pension discount curve 
we project benefit cash flows from our two largest defined benefit plans against discount rates published in the september  citigroup pension discount curve matched to fit our expected liability payment pattern 
the benefits paid in each future year were discounted to the present at the published rate of the citigroup pension discount curve for that year 
these present values were added up and a discount rate for each plan was determined that would develop the same present value as the sum of the individual years 
to set the discount rate for all plans  the average of the discount rate for the two plans was rounded up to the nearest 
we believe this accurately reflects the future defined benefit payment streams for our plans 
in past years we rounded the yield of the moody s aa utility bond index up to the nearest 
we utilized this methodology due to the correlation of the average age and time to retirement for the participants in our plans and the maturity characteristics of the index 
for measuring benefit obligations as of september  and september  we employed a discount rate of and  respectively 
the basis point increase in our discount rate compared to the prior measurement date  the return on plan assets achieved in fiscal and our million of employer contributions in fiscal were the primary reasons for the million increase in funded status compared to the prior year 
if we had utilized the moody s aa utility bond index yield rounded up to the nearest  on september   our discount rate would have been in determining the long term rate of return for a plan  we consider the historical rates of return  the nature of the plan s investments and an expectation for the plan s investment strategies 
as of september  and we used an expected return on plan assets of 
the plan assets were divided among various investment classes 
as of september   approximately of plan assets were invested with equity managers  approximately of plan assets were invested with fixed income managers  and approximately of plan assets were held in cash 
the difference between actual and expected returns on plan assets is accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  affects our recorded obligations and recognized expenses in such future periods 
for fiscal our pension plans had actual returns on assets of million as compared with expected returns on assets of million  which resulted in a net deferred gain of million 
at september  we had an unrecognized loss of million 
in fiscal  we expect to charge to net periodic pension cost approximately million of this unrecognized loss 
the amount of this unrecognized loss charged to pension cost in future years is dependent upon future interest rates and pension investment results 
a basis point change in the discount rate  the expected increase in compensation levels or the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would have had the following effect on fiscal pension expense in millions  amounts in the table in parentheses reflect additional income basis point basis point increase decrease discount rate compensation level expected long term rate of return on plan assets several factors influence our annual funding requirements 
for the us qualified plans  our funding policy consists of annual contributions at a rate that provides for future plan benefits and maintains appropriate funded 
table of contents percentages 
these contributions are not less than the minimum required by the employee retirement income security act of  as amended erisa  and subsequent pension legislation and is not more than the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes 
amounts necessary to fund future obligations under these plans could vary depending on estimated assumptions 
the effect on operating results in the future of pension plan funding will depend in part on investment performance  funding decisions and employee demographics 
for fiscal and  there was no minimum contribution to the us qualified plans required by erisa 
however  at management s discretion  we made cash contributions to the us qualified plans of million and million during fiscal and  respectively 
during fiscal  we have a minimum contribution of approximately million to make to the us qualified plans 
based on current facts and assumptions  we anticipate contributing approximately million to the us qualified plans by the end of fiscal in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employer s accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r sfas 
sfas requires an employer that is a business entity and sponsors one or more single employer benefit plans to recognize the funded status of the benefit in its statement of financial position  recognize as a component of other comprehensive income  net of tax  the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period but are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost  measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the date of the employer s fiscal year end statement of financial position and disclose in the notes to financial statements additional information about certain effects on net periodic benefit cost for the next fiscal year that arise from delayed recognition of the gains or losses  prior service costs on credits  and transition asset or obligations 
sfas is effective no later than the end of the company s fiscal year ended september  if sfas had been effective as of september   total assets would have been approximately million lower  total liabilities would have been approximately million higher and shareholders equity would have been approximately million lower 
because our net pension liabilities are dependent upon future events and circumstances  the impact at the time of adoption of sfas may differ from these amounts 
new accounting standards see note description of business and summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements including the respective expected dates of adoption and expected effects on results of operations and financial condition 
non gaap measure we have included in the discussion under the caption management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview above a financial measure that is not prepared in accordance with gaap 
any analysis of non gaap financial measures should be used only in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap 
below  we define the non gaap financial measure  provide a reconciliation of the non gaap financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap  and discuss the reasons that we believe this information is useful to management and may be useful to investors 
net debt as defined we have defined the non gaap measure net debt to include the aggregate debt obligations reflected in our balance sheet  less the hedge adjustments resulting from terminated and existing fair value interest rate derivatives or swaps  the balance of our cash and cash equivalents  and certain other investments that we consider to be readily available to satisfy these debt obligations 
our management uses net debt  along with other factors  to evaluate our financial condition 
we believe that net debt is an appropriate supplemental measure of financial condition because it provides a more complete understanding of our financial condition before the impact of our decisions regarding the appropriate use of cash and liquid investments 
net debt is not intended to be a substitute for gaap financial measures and should not be

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and commodity prices 
our objective is to identify and understand these risks and then implement strategies to manage them 
when evaluating these strategies  we evaluate the fundamentals of each market  our sensitivity to movement in commodity pricing  and underlying accounting and business implications 
to implement these strategies  we periodically enter into various hedging transactions 
the sensitivity analyses we present below do not consider the effect of possible adverse changes in the general economy  nor do they consider additional actions we may take to mitigate our exposure to such changes 
there can be no assurance that we will manage or continue to manage any risks in the future or that our efforts will be successful 
derivative instruments we enter into a variety of derivative transactions 
we use interest rate swap agreements to manage the interest rate characteristics on a portion of our outstanding debt 
we evaluate market conditions and our leverage ratio in order to determine our tolerance for potential increases in interest expense that could result from floating interest rates 
from time to time we use forward contracts to limit our exposure to fluctuations in non functional foreign currency rates with respect to our operating units receivables 
we also use commodity swap agreements to limit our exposure to falling sales prices and rising raw material costs 
interest rates we are exposed to changes in interest rates  primarily as a result of our short term and long term debt 
we use swap agreements to manage the interest rate characteristics of a portion of our outstanding debt 
based on the amounts and mix of our fixed and floating rate debt at september  and september   if market interest rates increase an average of basis points  after considering the effects of our swaps  our interest expense would have increased by million and million  respectively 
we determined these amounts by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing costs and interest rate swap agreements 
these analyses do not consider the effects of changes in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
market risks impacting pension plans our pension plans are influenced by trends in the financial markets and the regulatory environment 
adverse general stock market trends and falling interest rates increase plan costs and liabilities 
during fiscal and 
table of contents the effect of a change in the discount rate would have impacted income from continuing operations before income taxes by approximately million and million  respectively 
foreign currency we are exposed to changes in foreign currency rates with respect to our foreign currency denominated operating revenues and expenses 
our principal foreign exchange exposure is the canadian dollar 
the canadian dollar is the functional currency of our canadian operations 
we have transaction gains or losses that result from changes in our operating units non functional currency 
for example  we have non functional currency exposure at our canadian operations because they have purchases and sales denominated in us dollars 
we record these gains or losses in foreign exchange gains and losses in the income statement 
from time to time  we enter into currency forward or option contracts to mitigate a portion of our foreign currency transaction exposure 
to mitigate potential foreign currency transaction losses  we may use offsetting internal exposures or forward contracts 
we also have translation gains or losses that result from translation of the results of operations of an operating unit s foreign functional currency into us dollars for consolidated financial statement purposes 
translated earnings were million higher in fiscal than if we had translated the same earnings using fiscal exchange rates 
translated earnings were million higher in fiscal than if we had translated the same earnings using fiscal exchange rates 
during fiscal and  the effect of a one percentage point change in exchange rates would have impacted accumulated other comprehensive income by approximately million and million  respectively 
commodities fiber the principal raw material we use in the production of recycled paperboard and corrugated medium is recycled fiber 
our purchases of old corrugated containers occ and double lined kraft clippings account for our largest fiber costs and approximately of our fiscal fiber purchases 
the remaining of our fiber purchases consists of a number of other grades of recycled paper 
from time to time we make use of financial swap agreements to limit our exposure to changes in occ prices 
with the effect of our occ swaps  a hypothetical increase in total fiber prices would have increased our costs by million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
in times of higher fiber prices  we may have the ability to pass a portion of the increased costs on to our customers in the form of higher finished product pricing  however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so 
coated unbleached kraft we purchase coated unbleached kraft cuk from external sources to use in our folding carton converting business 
a hypothetical increase in cuk prices throughout each year would have increased our costs by approximately million during fiscal and by approximately million during fiscal in times of higher cuk prices  we may have the ability to pass a portion of our increased costs on to our customers in the form of higher finished product pricing  however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so 
linerboard corrugated medium we have the capacity to produce approximately  tons per year of corrugated medium at our st 
paul  minnesota operation 
from time to time  we make use of swap agreements to limit our exposure to falling corrugated medium sales prices at our st 
paul operation 
taking into account the effect of swaps we had in place  a hypothetical decrease in selling price throughout each year would have resulted in lower sales of approximately million and million during fiscal and  respectively 
we convert approximately  tons per year of corrugated medium and linerboard in our corrugated box converting operations into corrugated sheet stock 
a hypothetical increase in linerboard and corrugated 
table of contents medium pricing throughout each year would have resulted in increased costs of approximately million and million during fiscal and  respectively 
we may have the ability to pass a portion of our increased costs on to our customers in the form of higher finished product pricing  however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so 
energy energy is one of the most significant manufacturing costs of our paperboard operations 
we use natural gas  electricity  fuel oil and coal to generate steam used in the paper making process and to operate our recycled paperboard machines and primarily electricity for our converting equipment 
our bleached paperboard mill uses wood by products for most of its energy 
we generally purchase these products from suppliers at market rates 
occasionally  we enter into long term agreements to purchase natural gas 
we spent approximately million on all energy sources in fiscal natural gas and fuel oil accounted for approximately million mmbtu of our total purchases in fiscal excluding fixed price natural gas forward contracts  a hypothetical change in the price of energy throughout the year would have increased our cost of energy by million 
we spent approximately million on all energy sources in fiscal natural gas and fuel oil accounted for approximately million mmbtu of our total purchases in fiscal excluding fixed price natural gas forward contracts  a hypothetical change in the price of energy throughout the year would have increased our cost of energy by million 
we may have the ability to pass a portion of our increased costs on to our customers in the form of higher finished product pricing  however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so 
we periodically evaluate alternative scenarios to manage these risks
