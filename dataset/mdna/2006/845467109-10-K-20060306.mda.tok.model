item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this form k contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in forward looking statements for many reasons  including the risks described in risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
you should read the following discussion with the selected financial data and our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this form k 
all historical per share information in the selected financial data  financial statements  footnotes and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations have been adjusted to reflect the two for one stock splits effected on june  and november  overview southwestern energy company is an independent energy company primarily focused on natural gas 
our primary business is the exploration  development and production of natural gas and crude oil within the united states  with operations principally located in arkansas  oklahoma  texas  new mexico and louisiana 
we are also focused on creating and capturing additional value at and beyond the wellhead through our established natural gas distribution  marketing and transportation businesses and our expanding gathering activities 
our marketing and our gas gathering businesses are collectively referred to as our midstream services 
we operate principally in three segments exploration and production or e p  natural gas distribution and midstream services 
our business strategy is focused on providing long term growth in the net asset value of our business  which we achieve in our e p business through the drillbit 
in our e p business  we prepare economic analyses for each of our drilling and acquisition opportunities and rank them based upon the expected present value added for each dollar invested  which we refer to as pvi 
the pvi of the future expected cash flows for each project is determined using a discount rate 
we target creating at least of discounted pre tax pvi for each dollar we invest in our e p projects 
our actual pvi results are utilized to help determine the allocation of our future capital investments 
we currently derive the vast majority of our operating income and cash flow from the natural gas production of our e p business and expect this to continue in the future 
we expect that growth in our operating income and revenues will primarily depend on natural gas prices and our ability to increase our natural gas production 
there has been significant price volatility in the natural gas and crude oil market in recent years due to a variety of factors we cannot control or predict 
these factors  which include weather conditions  political and economic events  and competition from other energy sources  impact supply and demand for natural gas 
in addition  the price we realize for our gas production is affected by our hedging activities as well as locational differences in market prices 
our ability to increase our natural gas production is dependent upon our ability to economically find and produce natural gas  our abil ity to control costs  and our ability to market natural gas on economically attractive terms to our customers 
in  our gas and oil production continued to increase  reaching bcfe  up from bcfe in and bcfe in the increase in production resulted from a bcfe increase in production from our overton field in east texas and a bcfe increase in our arkoma production 
we reported net income of million in  or per share on a fully diluted basis  up from million  or per share in in  we reported net income of million  or per share on a fully diluted basis 
the increases in net income in and were a result of increased production volumes and higher realized natural gas and oil prices in our e p segment 
operating income for our e p segment was million in  up from million in and million in the increases in operating income for our e p segment in and were also due to increased production volumes and higher realized prices  partially offset by increased operating costs and expenses 
operating income for our gas distribution segment was million in  compared to million in and million in the decrease in operating income for our gas distribution segment in resulted primarily f rom warmer weather  increased customer conservation and increased operating costs and expenses 
the increase in operating income for our gas distribution segment in resulted primarily from increased rates implemented in october our gas distribution segment also implemented increased rates in october which will generate approximately million of annual revenue 
our cash flow from operating activities was million in  compared to million in and million in in our e p segment  we achieved a reserve replacement ratio of in at a finding and development cost of per mcfe  including reserve revisions  but excluding million of capital invested in acquiring drilling rigs 
our year end reserves grew to bcfe  up from bcfe at the end of our results were primarily fueled swn 
table of contents by the continued success of our drilling in our overton field in east texas and our emerging fayetteville shale play in arkansas 
our capital investments totaled million in  up from million in and million in we invested million in our e p segment in including million invested in drilling rigs  compared to million in and million in funds for our capital investments were provided by cash flow from operations and our follow on equity offering in september  which raised approximately million  net of related expenses 
we also applied a portion of the net proceeds of the equity offering to the repayment of our indebtedness 
as a result  our total debt to capitalization ratio decreased to at december  from at december  for  planned capital investments of million include million for our e p segment  which is an increase of over our e p capital investments in the million of exploration and production investments includes million for the accelerated development of our fayetteville shale play and million for the fabrication of drilling rigs 
we continue to be focused on our strategy of adding value through the drillbit  as approximately of our e p capital  excluding our investment in drilling rigs  is allocated to drilling 
in addition to the planned investments in the fayetteville shale play  our e p investments in will be focused on our lower risk development drilling programs in east texas and other conventional drilling in the arkoma basin 
in  we are targeting production to be approximately bcfe to bcfe  compared to bcfe in  an increase of app roximately to 
we expect our capital investments in to be funded by cash flow from operations  the remaining net proceeds from our equity offering and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
with today s commodity price environment  our current capital program and our inventory of projects for the future  we believe we are well positioned to continue to build upon the momentum achieved in recent years

operating income from our e p segment was million in  up from million in and million in the increases in and were due to the increases in revenues  partially offset by increases in operating costs and expenses 
production 
gas and oil production totaled bcfe in  bcfe in and bcfe in the increase in production resulted from a bcfe increase in production from our overton field in east texas and a bcfe increase in our arkoma production  primarily from the fayetteville shale 
production during was reduced by the effect of the curtailment of a portion of our overton field production due to repairs of a transmission line that is not operated by us and by the effect of hurricane katrina 
combined  these events reduced our production by an estimated bcfe 
the increase in production resulted primarily from an bcfe increase in production from our overton field in east texas  a bcfe increase in our arkoma basin production  and bcfe from our river ridge discovery in new mexico 
although we expect production volumes in to increase primarily due to the development of our fayetteville shale play  we cannot guarantee our longer term success in discovering  developing  and producing reserves 
our ability to discover  develop and produce reserves is dependent upon a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control  including the availability of capital  the timing and extent of changes in natural gas and oil prices and competition 
there are also many risks inherent to the discovery  development and p roduction of natural gas and oil 
we refer you to risk factors in item a of part i of this form k for a discussion of these risks and the impact they could have on our financial condition and results of operations 
gas sales to unaffiliated purchasers were bcf in  up from bcf in and bcf in sales to unaffiliated purchasers are primarily made under contracts that reflect current short term prices and are subject to seasonal price swings 
intersegment sales to arkansas western were bcf in  bcf in and bcf in we expect future increases in demand for our gas production to come primarily from sales to unaffiliated purchasers 
future sales to arkansas western s gas distribution systems will be dependent upon our success in obtaining gas supply contracts with the utility systems 
we are unable to predict changes in the market demand and price for natural gas  including changes that may be induced by the effects of weather on demand of both affiliated and unaffiliated customers for our production 
additionally  we hold a large amount of undeveloped leasehold acreage and producing acreage  and have an inventory of drilling leads  prospects and seismic data that will continue to be evaluated and developed in the future 
our exploration programs have been and continue to be directed primarily toward natural gas 
commodity prices we periodically enter into various hedging and other financial arrangements with respect to a portion of our projected natural gas and crude oil production in order to ensure certain desired levels of cash flow and to minimize the impact of price fluctuations we refer you to item a of this form k and note to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 
the average price realized for our gas production  including the effects of hedges  was per mcf in  per mcf in and per mcf in the changes in the average price realized primarily reflect changes in average annual spot market prices and the effects of our price hedging activities 
our hedging activities lowered the average gas price per mcf in  per mcf in and per mcf in disregarding the impact of hedges  historically the average price received for our gas production has been approximately to per m cf lower than average spot market prices due to locational market differentials that reduce the average prices received 
in  widening market differentials caused the difference in the average price received to be approximately per mcf 
assuming a nymex commodity price for of per mcf of gas  our differential for the average price received for our gas production is expected to be approximately to per mcf below the nymex henry hub index price  including the impact of our basis hedges 
as of december   we have hedged basis differentials on production volumes of bcf in  bcf in and bcf in as a means to partially reduce the effect of market differentials on prices we receive 
we realized an average price of per barrel  including the effects of hedges  for our oil production for the year ended december   up from per barrel for and per barrel for our hedging activities lowered the average oil price by per barrel in  per barrel in and per barrel in disregarding the impact of hedges  we expect the average price received for our oil production to be approximately lower than posted spot market prices in at december   we had commodity price hedges in place on bcf of  and gas production and basis hedges on bcf of  and gas production 
at december   we had hedges in place on  barrels of oil production 
subsequent to december  and prior to february   we hedged an additional bcf of gas production under costless collars with floor prices ranging from to per mcf and ceiling prices ranging from to per mcf 
additionally  we hedged the basis differential on the bcf of gas production 
as of february   we have hedged approximately to of our swn 
table of contents anticipated gas production level and to of our anticipated oil production level 
operating costs and expenses lease operating expenses per mcfe for the e p segment were in  up from in and in lease operating expenses per unit of production increased in due primarily to increases in compression  saltwater disposal and gas processing costs as well as generally higher oil field service costs 
we expect our average lease operating expenses per mcfe for this segment to increase in the future as our overton and conventional arkoma producing fields that have lower per unit operating costs  as compared to our other producing areas  continue to mature 
additionally  inflationary pressures continue to have an impact in all of our operating areas 
we do not have sufficient operating history for our fayetteville shale area to forecast with accuracy the future operating costs that we may incur related to the production from this area 
taxes other than income taxes per mcfe were in  compared to in and in the increases in and taxes other than income taxes per mcfe were primarily due to increased severance and ad valorem taxes that resulted from increases in commodity prices 
general and administrative expenses per mcfe for this segment were in  compared to in and in the increase in general and administrative costs per mcfe in from was due primarily to increased payroll costs relating to the expansion of our e p operations due to the fayetteville shale play and to increased incentive compensation costs 
the number of employees in our e p segment increased to at december  from at december  we expect our cost per mcfe for operating and general and administrative expenses to increase in primarily due to anticipated increases in oil field service costs and a continued increase in our staffing levels to accommodate our future expected growth 
future changes in our general and administrative expenses for this segment are primarily dependent upon our salary costs  level of pension expense  option expensing under fas r and the amount of incentive compensation paid to our employees 
for eligible employees  incentive compensation is based on the achievement of certain operating and performance results  including targeted cash flow  production  proved reserve additions  present value added for each dollar of capital invested  and lease operating expenses and general and administrative expenses per unit of production 
see critical accounting policies below for further discussion of pension expense and adoption of accounting principles for further discussion of option expensing under fas r 
our full cost pool amortization rate averaged per mcfe for  compared to in and in the amortization rate is impacted by reserve additions and the costs incurred for those additions  revisions of previous reserve estimates due to both price and well performance  and the level of unevaluated costs excluded from amortization 
although we expect our amortization rate to continue to increase in the near term as a result of increased costs in finding and developing gas and oil reserves see discussion on inflation below  we cannot predict our future full cost pool amortization rate with accuracy due to the variability of each of the factors discussed above  as well as the uncertainty of the future success of our fayetteville shale play 
unevaluated costs excluded from amortization were million at the end of  compared to million at the end of and million at the end of the increase in unevaluate d costs since december  resulted primarily from an increase in our undeveloped leasehold acreage related to our fayetteville shale play and increased drilling activity 
we utilize the full cost method of accounting for costs related to our natural gas and oil properties 
under this method  all such costs productive and nonproductive are capitalized and amortized on an aggregate basis over the estimated lives of the properties using the units of production method 
these capitalized costs are subject to a ceiling test  however  which limits such pooled costs to the aggregate of the present value of future net revenues attributable to proved gas and oil reserves discounted at percent standardized measure plus the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties 
any costs in excess of this ceiling are written off as a non cash expense 
the expense may not be reversed in future periods  even though higher natural gas and oil prices may subsequently increase the ceiling 
full cost companies must use the prices in effect at the end of each accounting quarter  including the impact of derivatives qualifying as hedges  to calculate the ceiling value of their reserves 
at december   and  our unamortized costs of natural gas and oil properties did not exceed this ceiling amount 
at december   our standardized measure was calculated based upon quoted market prices of per mcf for henry hub gas and per barrel for west texas intermediate oil  adjusted for market differentials 
a significant decline in natural gas and oil prices from year end levels or other factors  without other mitigating circumstances  could cause a future write down of capitalized costs and a non cash charge against future earnings 
inflation impacts our e p operations by generally increasing our operating costs and the costs of our capital additions 
the effects of inflation on our operations prior to were minimal due to low inflation rates 
however  since  as commodity prices have increased  the impact of inflation has intensified in our e p segment as shortages in swn 
table of contents drilling rigs  third party services and qualified labor have risen due to increased activity levels in the natural gas and oil industry 
this impact will continue to increase to the extent commodity prices remain high or further increase 
we have endeavored to mitigate rising costs by obtaining vendor pricing commitments for multiple projects and by offering performance bonuses related to increased economic efficiencies 
natural gas distribution year ended december  in thousands except for per mcf amounts revenues gas purchases operating costs and expenses operating income deliveries bcf sales and end use and off system transportation sales customers at year end average sales rate per mcf heating weather degree days percent of normal revenues and operating income gas distribution revenues fluctuate due to the effects of warm weather on demand for natural gas and the pass through of gas supply cost changes 
because of the corresponding changes in purchased gas costs  the revenue effect of the pass through of gas cost changes has not materially affected operating income 
gas distribution revenues increased in and in the increase in gas distribution revenues was primarily due to higher average sales rates as a result of higher gas prices and to the effects of a million annual rate increase implemented in october the increase in gas distribution revenues was primarily due to higher average sales rates as a result of higher gas prices and to the effects of a million annual rate increase implemented in october weather during in the utility s service territory was warmer than normal and colder than the prior year 
weather during in the utility s ser vice territory was warmer than normal and warmer than the prior year 
operating income for our gas distribution systems decreased in and increased in the decrease in operating income for this segment resulted primarily from increased operating costs and expenses along with warmer than normal weather 
the increase in operating income for this segment resulted primarily from rate increases implemented in late  partially offset by increased operating costs and expenses 
gas distribution revenues in future years will be impacted by the utility s gas purchase costs  customer growth  usage per customer and rate increases allowed by the arkansas public service commission  or apsc 
deliveries and rates in  arkansas western sold bcf to its customers at an average rate of per mcf  compared to bcf at per mcf in and bcf at per mcf in additionally  arkansas western transported bcf in  compared to bcf in and bcf in for its end use customers 
the decreases in volumes sold in and primarily resulted from variations in weather and customer conservation brought about by high gas prices in recent years 
arkansas western s tariffs contain a weather normalization clause to lessen the impact of revenue increases and decreases which might result from weather variations during the winter heating season 
the increase in the gas distribution segment s average sales rate for reflected changes in the average cost of gas purchased for delivery to our customers  which are passed through to customers under automatic adjustment clauses 
total deliveries to industrial customers of the gas distribution segment  including transportation volumes  were bcf in  bcf in and bcf in changes in deliveries to industrial customers are impacted by customer conservation caused by high gas prices and by continued industrial growth in the region 
arkansas western also transported less than bcf of gas through its gathering system in  compared to bcf in and bcf in for off system deliveries  all to the ozark gas transmission system 
the level of off system deliveries each year generally reflects the impact of weather changing the on system demands of our gas distribution systems for our gas production 
the average off system transportation rate was approximately per mcf  exclusive of fuel  in  and swn 
table of contents future volumes delivered to customers will be impacted by customer growth  weather and the effect that gas prices will continue to have on customer conservation 
operating costs and expenses the changes in purchased gas costs for the gas distribution segment reflect volumes purchased  prices paid for supplies and the mix of purchases from various gas supply contracts base load  swing and no notice 
operating costs and expenses  net of purchased gas costs  increased in to million from million in the increase was primarily due to a million increase in general and administrative expenses due to increased salaries and incentive compensation costs  and a million increase in transmission expense as a result of higher fuel costs 
operating costs and expenses for  net of purchased gas costs  increased to million from million in due primarily to a million increase in transmission expense as a result of higher fuel costs and a million increase in depreciation expense as a result of increases in property  plant and equipment 
future changes in our general and administrative expenses for this segment are primarily dependent upon our salary costs  level of pension expense  option expensing under fas r and the amount of incentive compensation paid to our employees 
see critical accounting policies and adoption of accounting principles below for further discussion of pension expense and option expensing  respectively 
in october  arkansas western instituted a competitive bidding process for its gas supply 
additionally  arkansas western annually submits its gas supply plan to the general staff of the apsc 
as a result of the bidding process under the plan filed for the gas purchase year  seeco successfully bid on gas supply packages representing approximately of the requirements for arkansas western for the contracts awarded to seeco expire through arkansas western enters into hedging activities from time to time with respect to its gas purchases to protect against the inherent price risks of adverse price fluctuations 
our gas distribution segment hedged bcf of gas purchases in which had the effect of increasing its total gas supply costs by million 
in  our utility hedged bcf of its gas supply which decreased its total gas supply cost by million 
in  our utility hedged bcf of its gas supply whi ch decreased its total gas supply cost by million 
at december   arkansas western had bcf of future gas purchases hedged at an average purchase price of per mcf 
we refer you to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
inflation impacts our gas distribution segment by generally increasing our operating costs and the costs of our capital additions 
the effects of inflation on the utility s operations in recent years have been minimal due to low inflation rates 
additionally  delays inherent in the rate making process prevent us from obtaining immediate recovery of increased operating costs of our gas distribution segment 
regulatory matters arkansas western s rates and operations are regulated by the apsc and it operates through municipal franchises that are perpetual by virtue of state law 
these franchises  however  may not be exclusive within a geographic area 
although its rates for gas delivered to its retail customers are not regulated by the ferc  its transmission and gathering pipeline systems are subject to the ferc s regulations concerning open access transportation 
as the regulatory focus of the natural gas industry has shifted from the federal level to the state level  some utilities across the nation are required to unbundle residential sales services from transportation services in an effort to promote greater competition 
there is no such legislation in arkansas and no regulatory directives related to natural gas are presently pending 
in recent years  there have been efforts by the arkansas legislature and the apsc concerning issues of deregulation of the retail sa le of electricity and a large user access program for electric service choice 
legislation adopted in for the deregulation of the retail sale of electricity was repealed in and no legislation has been taken regarding implementing a large user access program 
in april  the apsc adopted natural gas procurement plan rules for utilities 
these rules require utilities to take all reasonable and prudent steps necessary to develop a diversified gas supply portfolio 
the portfolio should consist of an appropriate combination of different types of gas purchase contracts and or financial hedging instruments that are designed to yield an optimum balance of reliability  reduced volatility and reasonable price 
utilities are also required to submit on an annual basis their gas supply plan  along with their contracting and or hedging objectives  to the staff of the apsc for review and determination as to whether it is consistent with these policy principles 
arkansas western also purchases gas from unaffiliated producers under take or pay contracts 
we believe that we do not have significant exposure to liabilities resulting from these contracts and expect to be able to continue to satisfactorily manage our exposure to take or pay liabilities 
swn 
table of contents in october  in response to arkansas western s request for a million rate increase  the apsc approved a rate increase totaling million annually  exclusive of costs to be recovered through arkansas western s purchase gas adjustment clause 
the rate increase was effective for deliveries made to customers on or after october  the request relating to the october increase assumed a rate of return of and a capital structure of debt and equity 
the apsc order provided for an allowed return on equity of and as assumed capital structure of debt and equity 
in its order approving the rate increase  the apsc stated that it would consider in future generic proceedings  certain regulatory changes including a streamlined ratecase process  a revenue decoupling mechanism designed to encourage efficiency and conservation  and a performance based methodology designed to allow a vari able return on equity adjustment within a reasonable range 
in september  in response to our request for an million rate increase  arkansas western received regulatory approval from the apsc of a rate increase totaling million annually  exclusive of costs to be recovered through arkansas western s purchase gas adjustment clause 
the order also entitled arkansas western to recover certain additional costs totaling million through its purchase gas adjustment clause over a two year period 
the rate increase was effective for all customer bills rendered on or after october  rate increase requests  which may be filed in the future  will depend on customer growth  increases in operating expenses  and additional investment in property  plant and equipment 
midstream services year ended december  revenues in millions gas purchases in millions operating income in millions gas volumes marketed bcf our operating income from midstream services was million on revenues of million in  compared to million on revenues of million in and million on revenues of million in the increase in revenues in resulted from increased volumes marketed and an increase in natural gas commodity prices 
the increase in revenues from higher prices was largely offset by a corresponding increase in gas purchase expense 
the increase in operating income during was primarily due to higher marketing margins on natural gas sales caused in large part by the increased volatility of locational market differentials in our core operating areas 
we marketed bcf in  compared to bcf in and bcf in the increase in volumes marketed in and resulted from marketing our increased production volumes  largely related to our overton field in east texas 
of the total volumes marketed  production from our exploration and production subsidiaries accounted for in  in and in we enter into hedging activities from time to time with respect to our gas marketing activities to provide margin protection 
we refer you to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and note to the financial statements for additional discussion 
midstream services also had gathering revenues of million in related to gathering systems it owns in arkansas 
gathering revenues and expenses for this segment are expected to continue to grow in the future as gathering systems supporting our fayetteville shale play are constructed 
transportation at december   we owned a interest in the ozark gas transmission system 
we recorded pre tax income from operations related to our investment of million in  compared to a pre tax loss of million in and pre tax income of million in these amounts are recorded in other income expense in our income statement 
the increase in pre tax income in results from an increase in volumes transported and higher transportation rates collected for those volumes 
the pre tax loss in was primarily due to a million negative adjustment from the operator of the pipeline for prior period allocations of income and expenses to the partners 
the pre tax gain in included a gain of million recognized on the sale of a mile portion of ozark gas transmission system s pipeline located in oklahoma that had limited strategic value to the overall system 
we refer you to note to the consolidated financial stateme nts for additional discussion 
at december  and  we had guaranteed million and million  respectively  of the partnership debt 
this debt financed a portion of the original construction costs

interest expense and interest income interest costs  net of capitalization  were down in and down in  both as compared to prior years 
in  interest expense was reduced primarily due to lower average borrowings under our revolving debt facility as a result of our equity offering in september we refer you to management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources financing requirements and note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our debt 
in  higher interest costs that resulted from increased average borrowings were offset by an increase in capitalized interest in the e p segment 
interest capitalized increased in and increased in changes in capitalized interest are primarily due to the level of costs excluded from amortization in our e p segment and the capitalization of interest during the construction phase of our drilling rigs 
costs excluded from amortization in the e p segment increased to million at december   compared to million at december  total capital expenditures for our e p segment were million in  up from million in during  we earned interest income of million related to our cash investments 
this amount is recorded in other income

our cash flow from operating activities is highly dependent upon the market prices that we receive for our gas production 
the price received for our production is also influenced by our commodity hedging activities  as more fully discussed in note to the financial statements included in this form k and item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
natural gas and oil prices are subject to wide fluctuations

we may adjust the level of capital investments dependent upon our level of cash flow generated from operations and our ability to borrow under our credit facility 
financing requirements our total debt outstanding was million at december  and million at december  in january  we amended and restated our previous million revolving credit facility due to expire in january  increasing the borrowing capacity to million and extending the expiration to january at december   we had no outstanding debt under our revolving credit facility 
the interest rate on the facility is calculated based upon our public debt rating and is currently basis points over libor 
our publicly traded notes were downgraded in january by standard and poor s to bbb from bbb  and continue to be rated ba by moody s 
any future downgrades in our public debt ratings could increase the cost of funds under our revolving credit facility 
our revolving credit facility contains covenants which impose certain restrictions on us 
under the credit agreements  we may not issue total debt in excess of of our total capital  must maintain a certain level of shareholders equity  and must maintain a ratio of ebitda to interest expense of or above 
additionally  there are certain limitations on the amount of indebtedness that may be incurred by our subsidiaries 
we were in compliance with all of the covenants of our credit agreements at december  although we do not anticipate any violations of our financial covenants  our ability to comply with those covenants is dependent upon the success of our exploration and development program and upon factors beyond our control  such as the market prices for natural gas and oil 
if we are unable to borrow under our credit facility  we would have to decrease our capital expenditure plans

contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments we have various contractual obligations in the normal course of our operations and financing activities 
significant contractual obligations at december  were as follows contractual obligations payments due by period total less than year to years to years more than years in thousands long term debt interest on senior notes operating leases unconditional purchase obligations operating agreements rental compression demand charges drilling rigs other obligations interest on the senior notes includes interest through on the million notes that are due in and putable at the holder s option in we lease certain office space and equipment under non cancelable operating leases expiring through our gas distribution segment has volumetric commitments for the purchase of gas under non cancelable competitive bid packages and non cancelable wellhead contracts 
volumetric purchase commitments at december  totaled bcf  comprised of bcf in less than one year  bcf in one to three years and bcf in three to five years 
our volumetric purchase commitments are priced primarily at regional gas indices set at the first of each future month 
these costs are recoverable from the utility s end use customers 
our e p segment has commitments for up to million in termination fees related to rig operator agreements in the event that the agreements are terminated 
our e p and midstream services segments have commitments for approximately million of compressor rental fees associated primarily with our overton operations and our fayetteville shale play 
our gas distribution segment has commitments for approximately million of demand charges on non cancelable firm gas purchase and firm transportation agreements

we are subject to litigation and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business 
management believes  individually or in aggregate  such litigation and claims will not have a material adverse impact on our financial position or our results of operations but these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management s view may change in the future 
if an unfavorable final outcome were to occur  there exists the possibility of a material impact on our financial position and the results of operations for the period in which the effect becomes reasonably estimable 
a lawsuit was filed against us in alleging a breach of an agreement to indemnify the other party against settlement payments related to the company s boure prospect in louisiana 
the allegations were contested and  in  we were granted a motion for summary judgment by the trial court 
the case was appealed to the first court of appeals in houston  texas  which subsequently transferred the appeal to the thirteenth court of appeals in corpus christi 
the appeal was briefed and argued during on april   the thirteenth court of appeals reversed the orders of the trial court and rendered judgment denying our motion for summary judgment and granting the motion for summary judgment of the other party 
our motion for rehearing with the thirteenth court of appeals was denied on may  in august of  we filed a petition for review with the texas supreme court 
in october of  the texas supreme court invited additional briefing by the parties  which both parties have done 
the matter is currently pending before the texas supreme court 
should the other party prevail on the appeal  we could be required to pay approximately million  plus pre judgment interest and attorney s fees 
based on an assessment of this litigation by us and our legal counsel  no accrual for loss is currently recorded 
working capital we maintain access to funds that may be needed to meet capital requirements through our credit facility described above 
we had positive working capital of million at the end of and negative working capital of million at the end of current assets included million of remaining proceeds from our equity offering that is invested in cash investments 
current liabilities increased million  due primarily to an increase in our current hedging liability and accounts payable accruals at december  critical accounting policies natural gas and oil properties we utilize the full cost method of accounting for costs related to our natural gas and oil properties 
under the full cost accounting rules of the sec  all such costs productive and nonproductive are capitalized and amortized on an aggregate basis over the estimated lives of the properties using the units of production method 
unevaluated costs are reviewed twice a year for individual impairment 
capitalized costs within the full cost pool are subjected quarterly to a ceiling test  which limits such pooled costs to the aggregate of the present value of future net revenues attributable to proved gas and oil reserves discounted at percent plus the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties 
if the net capitalized costs of natural gas and oil properties exceed the ceiling  we will record a ceiling test write down to the extent of such excess 
a ceiling test write down is a non cash charge to earnings 
if required  it reduces earnings and impac ts shareholders equity in the period of occurrence and results in lower depreciation  depletion and amortization expense in future periods 
the write down may not be reversed in future periods  even though higher natural gas and oil prices may subsequently increase the ceiling 
the risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of our natural gas and oil properties increases when natural gas and oil prices are depressed or if there are substantial downward revisions in estimated proved reserves 
under the sec s full cost accounting rules  our reserves are required to be priced using prices in effect at the end of the reporting period 
application of these rules during periods of relatively low natural gas or oil prices due to seasonality or other reasons  even if temporary  increases the probability of a ceiling test write down 
based on natural gas and oil prices in effect on december   the unamortized cost of our natural gas and oil properties did not exceed the ceiling of proved natural gas and oil reserves 
natural gas pricing has historically been unpredictable and any significant declines could result in a ceiling test write down in subsequent quarterly or annual reporting periods 
swn 
table of contents natural gas and oil reserves used in the full cost method of accounting cannot be measured exactly 
our estimate of natural gas and oil reserves requires extensive judgments of reservoir engineering data and is generally less precise than other estimates made in connection with financial disclosures 
our reservoir engineers prepare our reserve estimates under the supervision of our management 
reserve estimates are prepared for each of our properties annually by the reservoir engineers assigned to the asset management team in the geographic locations in which the property is located 
these estimates are reviewed by senior engineers who are not part of the asset management teams and the president of our e p subsidiaries 
final authority over the estimates of our proved reserves rests with our board of directors 
in each of the past three years  revisions to our proved reserve estimates represented no grea ter than of our total proved reserve estimates  which we believe is indicative of the effectiveness of our internal controls 
proved developed reserves generally have a higher degree of accuracy in this estimation process  when compared to proved undeveloped and proved non producing reserves  as production history and pressure data over time is available for the majority of our proved developed properties 
proved developed reserves account for of our total reserve base 
assigning monetary values to such estimates does not reduce the subjectivity and changing nature of such reserve estimates 
the uncertainties inherent in the reserve estimates are compounded by applying additional estimates of the rates and timing of production and the costs that will be incurred in developing and producing the reserves 
we cannot assure you that our internal controls sufficiently address the numerous uncertainties and risks that are inherent in estimating quantities of natural gas and oil reserves and projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures as many factors are beyond our control 
we refer you to the natural gas and oil reserves data we report are only estimates and may prove to be inaccurate 
in item a  risk factors  of part i of this form k for a more detailed discussion of these uncertainties  risks and other factors 
we engage the services of netherland  sewell associates  inc  an independent petroleum engineering firm  to audit our reserves as estimated by our reservoir engineers 
netherland  sewell associates  inc reports the results of the reserves audit to our board of directors 
in conducting its audit  the engineers and geologists of netherland  sewell associates study our major properties in detail and independently develop reserve estimates 
for the year ended december   netherland  sewell associates issued its audit opinion as to the reasonableness of our reserve estimates  stating that our estimated proved oil and gas reserves are  in the aggregate  reasonable and have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted petroleum engineering and evaluation principles 
a decline in gas and oil prices used to calculate the discounted future net revenues of our reserves affects both the present value of cash flows and the quantity of reserves reported 
our reserve base is natural gas  therefore changes in oil prices used do not have as significant an impact as gas prices on cash flows and reported reserve quantities 
reported discounted cash flows and reserve quantities at december  were  million and bcfe 
an assumed decrease of per mcf in the december  gas price used to price our reserves would have resulted in an approximate million to million decline in our future cash flows discounted at and an approximate decrease of bcfe of our reported reserves 
under this assumption  our unamortized costs remained below the ceiling of proved natural gas and oil reserves 
the decline in reserve quantities  assuming this decrease in gas price  would have the impact of increasing our unit of production amortization of the full cost pool 
the unit of production rate for amortization is adjusted quarterly based on changes in reserve estimates 
hedging we use natural gas and crude oil swap agreements and options and interest rate swaps to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flow due to fluctuations in the prices of natural gas and oil and in interest rates 
our policies prohibit speculation with derivatives and limit swap agreements to counterparties with appropriate credit standings to minimize the risk of uncollectability 
in recent years  we have hedged to of our annual production 
the primary market risks related to our derivative contracts are the volatility in market prices and basis differentials for natural gas and crude oil 
however  the market price risk is offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the related sale or purchase of the natural gas or sale of the oil that is hedged 
our derivative instruments are accounted for under fas  as amended by fas and  and are recorded at fair value in our financial statements 
we have established the fair value of derivative instruments using estimates determined by our counterparties  with such estimates evaluated internally using established index prices and other sources 
these valuations are recognized as assets or liabilities in our balance sheet and  to the extent an open position is an effective cash flow hedge on equity production or interest rates  the offset is recorded in other comprehensive income 
results of settled commodity hedging transactions are reflected in natural gas and oil sales or in gas purchases 
results of settled interest rate hedges are reflected in interest expense 
any ineffective hedge  derivative not qualifying for accounting treatment as a hedge  or ineffective portion of a hedge is recognized immediately in earnings 
for the year ended december   we recorded a gain of million related to differential swaps which was partially offset by a million loss swn 
table of contents related to the change in estimated ineffectiveness of our cash flow hedges 
we recorded a loss in revenues of million in and a gain of million in related to the changes in ineffectiveness of our commodity hedges 
future market price volatility could create significant changes to the hedge positions recorded in our financial statements 
we refer you to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in item a of part ii of this form k for additional information regarding our hedging activities 
regulated utility operations our utility operations are subject to the rate regulation and accounting requirements of the apsc 
allocations of costs and revenues to accounting periods for ratemaking and regulatory purposes may differ from those generally applied by non regulated operations 
such allocations to meet regulatory accounting requirements are considered generally accepted accounting principles for regulated utilities provided that there is a demonstrated ability to recover any deferred costs in future rates 
during the ratemaking process  the regulatory commission may require a utility to defer recognition of certain costs to be recovered through rates over time as opposed to expensing such costs as incurred 
this allows the utility to stabilize rates over time rather than passing such costs on to the customer for immediate recovery 
this causes certain expenses to be deferred as a regulatory asset and amortized to expense as they are recovered through rates 
the apsc has not required any unbundling of services  although large industrials are free to contract for their own gas supply 
there are no pending regulations relating to unbundling of services  however  should such regulation be proposed and adopted  certain of these assets may no longer meet the criteria for deferred recognition and  accordingly  a write off of regulatory assets and stranded costs may be required 
pension and other postretirement benefits we record our prepaid or accrued benefit cost  as well as our periodic benefit cost  for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans using measurement assumptions that we consider reasonable at the time of calculation see note to the financial statements for further discussion and disclosures regarding these benefit plans 
two of the assumptions that affect the amounts recorded are the discount rate  which estimates the rate at which benefits could be effectively settled  and the expected return on plan assets  which reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested 
for the december  benefit obligation and the periodic benefit cost to be recorded in  the discount rate assumed is 
for the periodic benefit cost  the expected return assumed is 
this compares to a discount rate of and an expected return of used in the prior year 
using the assumed rates discussed above  we recorded pension expense of million in and million in related to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
we reflected a pension liability of million at december  and million at december  during  we also funded million to our pension plans 
in  we expect to fund million to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
assuming a change in the rates lower discount rate and lower rate of return  we would have recorded pension expense of million in gas in underground storage we record our gas stored in inventory that is owned by the e p segment at the lower of weighted average cost or market 
gas expected to be cycled within the next months is recorded in current assets with the remaining stored gas reflected as a long term asset 
the quantity and average cost of gas in storage was bcf at per mcf at december   compared to bcf at per mcf at december  the gas in inventory for the e p segment is used primarily to supplement production in meeting the segment s contractual commitments including delivery to customers of our gas distribution business  especially during periods of colder weather 
as a result  demand fees paid by the gas distribution segment to the e p segment  which are passed through to the utility s customers  are a part of the realized price of the gas in storage 
in determining the lower of cost or market for storage gas  we utilize the gas futures market in assessing the price we expect to be able to realize for our gas in inventory 
a significant decline in the future market price of natural gas could result in us writing down our carrying cost of gas in storage

table of contents estimates of our proved natural gas and oil reserves and the estimated future net revenues from such reserves are based upon various assumptions  including assumptions required by the sec relating to natural gas and oil prices  drilling and operating expenses  capital expenditures  taxes and availability of funds 
the process of estimating natural gas and oil reserves is complex 
this process requires significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data for each reservoir 
therefore  these estimates are inherently imprecise 
actual future production  natural gas and oil prices  revenues  taxes  development expenditures  operating expenses and quantities of recoverable natural gas and oil reserves will most likely vary from those estimated 
such variances may be material 
any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves set forth in this form k 
our properties may also be susceptible to hydrocarbon drainage from production by other operators on adjacent properties 
in addition  we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history  results of exploration and development  prevailing natural gas and oil prices and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
at december   approximately of our estimated proved reserves were proved undeveloped and were proved developed non producing 
proved undeveloped reserves and proved developed non producing reserves  by their nature  are less certain than proved developed producing reserves 
estimates of reserves in the non producing categories are nearly always based on volumetric calculations rather than the performance data used to estimate producing reserves 
recovery of proved undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations 
recovery of proved developed non producing reserves requires capital expenditures to recomplete into the zones behind pipe and is subject to the risk of a successful recompletion 
production revenues from proved undeveloped and proved developed non producing reserves will not be realized  if at all  until sometime in the future 
the reserve data assumes t hat we will make significant capital expenditures to develop our reserves 
although we have prepared estimates of our natural gas and oil reserves and the costs associated with these reserves in accordance with industry standards  we cannot assure you that the estimated costs are accurate  that development will occur as scheduled or that the actual results will be as estimated 
you should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows referred to in this form k is the current fair value of our estimated natural gas and oil reserves 
in accordance with sec requirements  the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves are generally based on prices and costs as of the date of the estimate 
actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of the estimate 
any changes in consumption by gas purchasers or in governmental regulations or taxation could also affect actual future net cash flows 
the timing of both the production and the expenses from the development and production of natural gas and oil properties will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves and their present value 
in addition  the discount factor  which is required by the sec to be used in calculating discounted futur e net cash flows for reporting purposes  is not necessarily the most accurate discount factor for our company 
should one or more of the risks or uncertainties described above or elsewhere in this form k occur  or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect  our actual results and plans could differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks relating to our operations result primarily from the volatility in commodity prices  basis differentials and interest rates  as well as credit risk concentrations 
we use natural gas and crude oil swap agreements and options and interest rate swaps to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flow due to fluctuations in the prices of natural gas and oil and in interest rates 
our board of directors has approved risk management policies and procedures to utilize financial products for the reduction of defined commodity price and interest rate risks 
these policies prohibit speculation with derivatives and limit swap agreements to counterparties with appropriate credit standings 
credit risk our financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of trade receivables and derivative contracts associated with commodities trading 
concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across geographic areas 
no single customer accounts for greater than of accounts receivable at december  in addition  please see the discussion of credit risk associated with commodities trading below 
interest rate risk the following table provides information on our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the table presents our debt obligations  principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates

expected maturity date fair value thereafter total in millions fixed rate average interest rate commodities risk we use over the counter natural gas and crude oil swap agreements and options to hedge sales of our production  to hedge activity in our marketing segment and to hedge the purchase of gas in our utility segment against the inherent price risks of adverse price fluctuations or locational pricing differences between a published index and the nymex futures market 
these swaps and options include transactions in which one party will pay a fixed price or variable price for a notional quantity in exchange for receiving a variable price or fixed price based on a published index referred to as price swaps  transactions in which parties agree to pay a price based on two different indices referred to as basis swaps  and the purchase and sale of index related puts and calls collars that provide a floor price below which the counterparty pays production hedge or receives gas purchase hedge funds equal to the amount by which the p rice of the commodity is below the contracted floor  and a ceiling price above which we pay to production hedge or receive from gas purchase hedge the counterparty the amount by which the price of the commodity is above the contracted ceiling 
the primary market risks relating to our derivative contracts are the volatility in market prices and basis differentials for natural gas and crude oil 
however  the market price risk is offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the related sale or purchase of the natural gas or sale of the oil that is hedged 
credit risk relates to the risk of loss as a result of non performance by our counterparties 
the counterparties are primarily major investment and commercial banks which management believes present minimal credit risks 
the credit quality of each counterparty and the level of financial exposure we have to each counterparty are periodically reviewed to ensure limited credit risk exposure
