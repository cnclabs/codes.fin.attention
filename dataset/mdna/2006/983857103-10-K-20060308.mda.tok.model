critical accounting policies and estimates the company strives to report its financial results in a clear and understandable manner 
it follows accounting principles generally accepted in the united states in preparing its consolidated financial statements  which requires management to make certain estimates and apply judgments that affect its financial position and results of operations 
there have been no material changes in the company s policies or estimates since january  
table of contents the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires management to adopt accounting policies and make significant judgments and estimates to develop amounts reflected and disclosed in the financial statements 
in some instances  there may be alternative policies or estimation techniques that could be used 
management maintains a thorough process to review the application of accounting policies and to evaluate the appropriateness of the many estimates that are required to prepare the financial statements 
however  even under optimal circumstances  estimates routinely require adjustment based on changing circumstances and the receipt of new or better information 
the policies and estimates discussed below include the financial statement elements that are either the most judgmental or involve the selection or application of alternative accounting policies and are material to the financial statements 
management has discussed the development and selection of these accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 
accounts receivable allowances accounts receivable allowances are based on known customer exposures  historic credit experience  and the specific identification of potentially uncollectible accounts 
in addition to known or judgmental components  a policy that consistently applies reserve rates based on the age of outstanding accounts receivable is followed 
actual collections may differ  requiring adjustments to the reserves 
inventory reserves inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  judgments are made as to future demand requirements and compared to current inventory levels 
reserves are established for excess and obsolete inventory  based on material movement  market conditions  and technological advancements 
self insurance reserves the company is self insured up to certain limits for costs associated with benefits paid under employee health care programs 
the measurement of these costs requires the consideration of historic loss experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of costs per claim 
these costs are accounted for by developing estimates of the undiscounted liability for claims incurred  including those claims incurred but not reported 
this method provides estimates of future ultimate claim costs based on claims incurred as of the balance sheet date 
long lived assets evaluations are periodically made of long lived assets for indicators of impairment when events or circumstances indicate that this risk may be present 
judgments regarding the existence of impairment are based on several factors including but not limited to  market conditions  operational performance  technological advancements and estimated future cash flows 
if the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired  an impairment charge is recorded to adjust the asset to its fair value 
goodwill the company has million of goodwill recorded as of december   related to prior acquisitions 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment annually  or more frequently if indicators of impairment occur 
impairment indicators could include a significant adverse change in the business climate  operating performance indicators  or the decision to sell or dispose of a reporting unit 
the company uses a discounted cash flow method to determine whether impairment has occurred 
this model requires the use of estimates about the future cash flows of each reporting unit to determine estimated fair values 
changes in forecasted operations and changes in discount rates can materially affect these estimates 
however  once an impairment of goodwill has been recorded it cannot be reversed 
deferred tax valuation allowance the company periodically evaluates its deferred tax assets to assess the probability of their being ultimately realized 
upon determination that a deferred tax asset may not be realized  a valuation allowance is established for the potential unrealizable amount 
this evaluation process requires a review of the underlying transaction to determine that the conditions that led to the creation of the asset still exist and that the related tax benefit will be realized
