critical accounting policies no changes have been made in the company s critical accounting policies during the year ended december  the securities and exchange commission sec has issued disclosure guidance for critical accounting policies 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
management is required to make certain estimates and assumptions during the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these estimates and assumptions impact the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements 
estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period they are determined to be necessary 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in the company s annual report on form k 
not all of these significant accounting policies require management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates 
however  management considers the following policies to be critical within the sec definition 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when the following four basic criteria have been met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred and title has transferred or services rendered  iii the selling price is fixed and determinable  and iv collection is reasonably assured 
for orders with terms of fob shipping point  delivery and title transfer at the time of shipment  for fob destination orders  delivery and title transfer at the customer s premises 
the company s products are tested by its quality assurance department prior to shipment 
the company has no other obligation associated with its products once shipment has occurred except for customary warranty provisions 
historically  returns have been immaterial to the company s consolidated financial statements and are projected to remain at a consistent immaterial level in the future 
the company reports all amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling as revenue and includes all costs incurred for shipping and handling as cost of sales 
the company also provides certain contract fermentation services for which revenue is recorded at the time the materials are shipped to the customer  in accordance with the terms of the underlying purchase order  which orders do not contain customer acceptance clauses 
the purchase orders have historically had a very low cancellation rate 
the company s products carry limited warranties that in general do not exceed one year from date of sale with the exception of ultra low temperature freezers that carry a year warranty and certain shaker products that carry a year warranty 
the company accrues estimated product warranty costs based on historical trends at the time of sale and any additional amounts are recorded when such costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated 
the company periodically sells maintenance contracts to certain customers 
the value of such contracts is deferred and recognized into revenue on a straight line basis over the term of the contract 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out or average or market value and have been reduced by an allowance for excess and obsolete inventories 
the estimate is based on managements review of inventories on hand compared to estimated future usage and sales 
cost includes material  labor and manufacturing overhead 
long lived assets long lived assets  such as property  plant  and equipment  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset  which is generally based on discounted cash flows 
goodwill  which is not subject to amortization is tested annually for impairment and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired 
an impairment loss for goodwill is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of the company exceeds its fair value 
the tradename value  which is being amortized over years  is tested for impairment upon the occurrence of a triggering event as defined by financial accounting standards board sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
deferred income taxes a valuation allowance has been recorded for certain deferred tax assets principally related to foreign net operating loss carryforwards  domestic capital loss carryforwards and contribution carryforwards 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
accounts receivable the company estimates an allowance for doubtful accounts after considering the collectibility of balances due  the credit worthiness of the customer and its current level of business with the customer 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  the company is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates as it seeks debt financing to make capital expenditures  potential acquisitions and invest in cash equivalents and marketable debt securities 
cash equivalents and other marketable investments are carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets 
the company is also exposed to certain foreign exchange risk 
at times  management might employ specific strategies  such as the use of derivative instruments or hedging to manage interest rate  foreign currency or other exposures 
further  the company does not expect its market risk exposures to change significantly in the near term 
at december   the outstanding borrowings of the company consisted primarily of variable rate long term debt the large majority of which has been fixed through interest rate swaps  which had a carrying value of  and a fair value of approximately  assuming other factors are held constant  interest rate changes generally affect the fair value of fixed rate debt  but do not impact the carrying value  earnings or cash flows 
accordingly  assuming a hypothetical increase of in interest rates and all other variables remaining constant  interest expense would not change  however  the fair value of the fixed rate long term debt would decrease by approximately  recently issued accounting standards in december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no
