item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on page other recent acquisitions and joint ventures over the last three years  we have devoted a significant amount of resources to acquisitions  including the subsequent integration of acquired businesses  and to joint ventures 
these acquisitions and joint ventures have expanded our base business  provided our customers with a wider array of products and presented new alternatives for discovery through additional chemistries 
the following is a summary of our acquisitions and joint ventures during the last three years on july   we completed the acquisition of the akzo nobel refinery catalysts business for approximately million  including expenses  at applicable exchange rates 
during and  we increased the purchase price by approximately million and million  respectively  due primarily to payments to akzo nobel as part of the post closing working capital adjustments 
during  significant progress was made in the determination of the final purchase price allocation versus the estimated allocation at december  however  none of the changes made to the december  allocation were material to our financial position or results of operations 
as part of the acquisition  we acquired ownership of non consolidated joint ventures in brazil f brica carioca de catalisadores sa  japan nippon ketjen co  ltd  and france eurecat sa with affiliates in the united states  saudi arabia and italy 
effective january   we acquired the business assets  customer lists and other intangibles of taerim international corporation for approximately million and formed albemarle korea corporation  which is located in seoul  south korea 
on december   we acquired the bromine fine chemicals business of atofina chemicals  inc for approximately million plus the assumption of certain liabilities 
the acquisition included atofina s production facility in port de bouc  france  as well as a long term supply agreement with atofina for certain fine chemicals 
the acquisition provided us with flexibility in raw material supply and complemented our existing network of bromine based facilities

on july   we acquired the phosphorus based polyurethane flame retardants businesses of rhodia sa  which included a production site in avonmouth in the united kingdom  and supply contracts for flame retardants and intermediates manufactured at rhodia s sites in charleston  south carolina  and in oldbury and widnes in the united kingdom 
the acquisition purchase price totaled approximately million in cash plus the assumption of certain liabilities 
on january   we acquired newmarket corporation s formerly ethyl corporation fuel and lubricant antioxidants working capital  patents and other intellectual property for approximately million in cash plus the assumption of certain liabilities 
employees as of december   we had approximately  employees of whom approximately  or  are employed in the united states  approximately  or  are employed in europe  and approximately  or  are employed in asia 
approximately of our us employees are unionized 
we have bargaining agreements at three of our us locations baton rouge  louisiana united steel workers usw  orangeburg  south carolina international brotherhood of teamsters industrial trades division  and pasadena  texas united steel workers usw  sheet metal workers international association  united association of journeymen apprentices of plumbing and pipefitting industry  and international brotherhood of electrical workers 
we believe that we have good working relationships with these unions  and we have operated without a labor work stoppage at each of these locations for more than years 
two of our bargaining agreements expire in and one expires in we have four works councils representing the majority of our european sites amsterdam and amersfoort  the netherlands  thann and port de bouc  france  and bergheim  germany covering approximately  employees 
in addition  we have approximately employees at our manufacturing facility in avonmouth  united kingdom that are represented by unions through a current collective bargaining agreement 
we believe that our relationship with these councils and bargaining representatives is generally good

risk factors 
you should consider carefully the following risks when reading the information  including the financial information  contained in this annual report on form k 
our inability to pass through increases in costs and expenses for raw materials and energy  on a timely basis or at all  could have a material adverse effect on the margins of our products 
our raw material and energy costs increased significantly in the increases were primarily driven by significantly tighter market conditions and major increases in pricing of basic building blocks for our products such as crude oil  chlorine and metals  including molybdenum  which is used in the refinery catalysts business 
we generally attempt to pass changes in the prices of raw materials and energy to our customers  but we may be unable to or be delayed in doing so 
our inability to pass through price increases or any limitation or delay in our passing through price increases could adversely affect our margins 
in addition to raising prices  raw material suppliers may extend lead times or limit supplies 
constraints on the supply or delivery of critical raw materials could disrupt production and adversely affect the performance of our business 

albemarle kxxjpg 
we face competition from other specialty chemical companies  which places downward pressure on the prices and margins of our products 
we operate in a highly competitive marketplace  competing against a number of domestic and foreign specialty chemical producers 
competition is based on several key criteria  including product performance and quality  product price  product availability and security of supply  responsiveness of product development in cooperation with customers and customer service 
some of our competitors are larger than we are and may have greater financial resources 
these competitors may also be able to maintain significantly greater operating and financial flexibility than we do 
as a result  these competitors may be better able to withstand changes in conditions within our industry  changes in the prices of raw materials and energy and in general economic conditions 
additionally  competitors pricing decisions could compel us to decrease our prices  which could affect our margins and profitability adversely 
our ability to maintain or increase our profitability is  and will continue to be  dependent upon our ability to offset decreases in the prices and margins of our products by improving production efficiency and volume  shifting to higher margin chemical products and improving existing products through innovation and research and development 
if we are unable to do so or to otherwise maintain our competitive position  we could lose market share to our competitors 
downturns in our customers cyclical industries could adversely affect our sales and profitability 
downturns in the businesses that use our specialty chemicals will adversely affect our sales 
many of our customers are in industries  including the electronics  building and construction  and automotive industries  that are cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in general economic conditions 
historically  downturns in general economic conditions have resulted in diminished product demand  excess manufacturing capacity and lower average selling prices  and we may experience similar problems in the future 
a decline in economic conditions in our customers cyclical industries may have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability 
our results are subject to fluctuation because of irregularities in the demand for our hpc catalysts and certain of our agrichemicals 
our hpc catalysts are used by petroleum refiners in their processing units to reduce the quantity of sulfur and other impurities in petroleum products 
the effectiveness of hpc catalysts diminishes with use  requiring the hpc catalysts to be replaced  on average  once every one to three years 
the sales of our hpc catalysts  therefore  are largely dependent on the useful life cycle of the hpc catalysts in the processing units 
sales of our agrichemicals are also subject to fluctuation as demand varies depending on climate and other environmental conditions  which may prevent farming for extended periods 
changes in our customers products can reduce the demand for our specialty chemicals 
our specialty chemicals are used for a broad range of applications by our customers 
changes in our customers products or processes may enable our customers to reduce consumption of the specialty chemicals that we produce or make our specialty chemicals unnecessary 
customers may also find alternative materials or processes that no longer require our products 
for example  many of our flame retardants are incorporated into resin systems to enhance the flame retardancy of a particular polymer 
should a customer decide to use a different polymer due to price  performance or other considerations  we may not be able to supply a product that meets the customer s new requirements 
consequently  it is important that we develop new products to replace the sales of products that mature and decline in use 
our business  results of operations  cash flows and margins could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to manage successfully the maturation of our existing products and the introduction of new products 
our research and development efforts may not succeed and our competitors may develop more effective or successful products 
the specialty chemicals industry is subject to periodic technological change and ongoing product improvements 
in order to maintain our margins and remain competitive  we must successfully develop  manufacture and market new or improved products 
as a result  we must commit substantial resources each year to research and development 
ongoing investments in research and development for future products could result in higher costs without a proportional increase in revenues 
additionally  for any new product program  there is a risk of technical or market failure in which case we may not be able to develop the new commercial products needed to maintain our competitive position or we may need to commit additional resources to new product development programs 
moreover  new products may have lower margins than the products they replace 
we also expect competition to increase as our competitors develop and introduce new and enhanced products 
for example  the fine chemicals segment is experiencing increased competition from large scale producers of pharmachemicals  particularly from asian sources 
in our catalysts segment  our petroleum refinery customers are processing crude oil feedstocks of declining quality  while at the same time operating under increasingly stringent regulations requiring the gasoline  diesel and other fuels they produce to contain fewer impurities  including sulfur 
as a result  our petroleum refining customers are demanding more effective and efficient catalysts products  and the average life cycle for new catalysts products has declined 
as new products enter the market  our products may become obsolete or competitors products may be marketed more effectively than our products 
if we fail to develop new 
albemarle kxxjpg 
products  maintain or improve our margins with our new products or keep pace with technological developments  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows will suffer 
our inability to protect our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
protection of our proprietary processes  methods and compounds and other technology is important to our business 
we generally rely on patent  trade secret  trademark and copyright laws of the united states and certain other countries in which our products are produced or sold  as well as licenses and nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements  to protect our intellectual property rights 
the patent  trade secret  trademark and copyright laws of some countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
failure to protect our intellectual property rights may result in the loss of valuable proprietary technologies 
additionally  some of our technologies are not covered by any patent or patent application and  even if a patent application has been filed  it may not result in an issued patent 
if patents are issued to us  those patents may not provide meaningful protection against competitors or against competitive technologies 
we cannot assure you that our intellectual property rights will not be challenged  invalidated  circumvented or rendered unenforceable 
we could face patent infringement claims from our competitors or others alleging that our processes or products infringe on their proprietary technologies 
if we are found to be infringing on the proprietary technology of others  we may be liable for damages  and we may be required to change our processes  to redesign our products partially or completely  to pay to use the technology of others or to stop using certain technologies or producing the infringing product entirely 
even if we ultimately prevail in an infringement suit  the existence of the suit could prompt customers to switch to products that are not the subject of infringement suits 
we may not prevail in any intellectual property litigation and such litigation may result in significant legal costs or otherwise impede our ability to produce and distribute key products 
we also rely upon unpatented proprietary manufacturing expertise  continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position 
while we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our intellectual property  we cannot assure you that our confidentiality agreements will not be breached  that they will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets and proprietary manufacturing expertise or that adequate remedies will be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or manufacturing expertise 
our substantial international operations subject us to risks of doing business in foreign countries  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we conduct a substantial portion of our business outside of the united states 
we and our joint ventures currently have facilities located outside the united states  including facilities and offices located in austria  belgium  brazil  france  germany  italy  japan  jordan  korea  the netherlands  the people s republic of china  saudi arabia and the united kingdom 
we expect sales from international markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our net sales and the net sales of our joint ventures 
accordingly  our business is subject to risks related to the differing legal  political  social and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many jurisdictions 
risks inherent in international operations include the following fluctuations in exchange rates may affect product demand and may adversely affect the profitability in us dollars of products and services we provide in international markets where payment for our products and services is made in the local currency  transportation and other shipping costs may increase  intellectual property rights may be more difficult to enforce  foreign countries may impose additional withholding taxes or otherwise tax our foreign income  or adopt other restrictions on foreign trade or investment  including currency exchange controls  unexpected adverse changes in foreign laws or regulatory requirements may occur  agreements may be difficult to enforce and receivables difficult to collect  compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations may be burdensome  unexpected adverse changes in export duties  quotas and tariffs and difficulties in obtaining export licenses  general economic conditions in the countries in which we operate could have an adverse effect on our earnings from operations in those countries  
albemarle kxxjpg 
foreign operations may experience staffing difficulties and labor disputes  foreign governments may nationalize private enterprises  and our business and profitability in a particular country could be affected by political or economic repercussions on a domestic  country specific or global level from terrorist activities and the response to such activities 
in addition  certain of our joint ventures operate in high risk regions of the world such as the middle east and south america 
unanticipated events  such as geopolitical changes  could result in a write down of our investment in the affected joint venture 
our success as a global business will depend  in part  upon our ability to succeed in differing legal  regulatory  economic  social and political conditions by developing  implementing and maintaining policies and strategies that are effective in each location where we and our joint ventures do business 
we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates  which may adversely affect our operating results and net income 
we conduct our business and incur costs in the local currency of most of the countries in which we operate 
the financial condition and results of operations of each foreign operating subsidiary and joint venture are reported in the relevant local currency and then translated to us dollars at the applicable currency exchange rate for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements 
changes in exchange rates between these foreign currencies and the us dollar will affect the recorded levels of our assets and liabilities as foreign assets and liabilities that are translated into us dollars for presentation in our financial statements as well as our net sales  cost of goods sold and operating margins and could result in exchange losses 
the main foreign currencies for which we have exchange rate fluctuation exposure are the european union euro  japanese yen and british pound sterling 
exchange rates between these currencies and the us dollar in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may do so in the future 
significant changes in these foreign currencies relative to the us dollar could also have an adverse effect on our ability to meet interest and principal payments on any foreign currency denominated debt outstanding 
in addition to currency translation risks  we incur currency transaction risks whenever one of our operating subsidiaries or joint ventures enters into either a purchase or a sales transaction using a different currency from the currency in which it receives revenues 
our operating results and net income may be affected by any volatility in currency exchange rates and our ability to manage effectively our currency transaction and translation risks 
we incur substantial costs in order to comply with extensive environmental  health and safety laws and regulations 
in the jurisdictions in which we operate  we are subject to numerous federal  state and local environmental  health and safety laws and regulations  including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water  the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated properties 
ongoing compliance with such laws and regulations is an important consideration for us and we incur substantial capital and operating costs in our compliance efforts 
environmental laws have become increasingly strict in recent years 
we expect this trend to continue and anticipate that compliance will continue to require increased capital expenditures and operating costs 
violations of environmental  health and safety laws and regulations may subject us to fines  penalties and other liabilities and may require us to change certain business practices 
if we violate environmental  health and safety laws or regulations  in addition to being required to correct such violations  we can be held liable in administrative  civil or criminal proceedings for substantial fines and other sanctions could be imposed that could disrupt or limit our operations 
liabilities associated with the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances  as well as personal injury  property damages or natural resource damages arising out of such hazardous substances  may be imposed in many situations without regard to violations of laws or regulations or other fault  and may also be imposed jointly and severally so that a responsible party may be held liable for more than its share of the losses involved  or even the entire loss 
such liabilities may also be imposed on many different entities with a relationship to the hazardous substances at issue  including  for example  entities that formerly owned or operated the property affected and entities that arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances at the affected property  as well as entities that currently own or operate such property 
such liabilities can be difficult to identify and the extent of any such liabilities can be difficult to predict 
we use  and in the past have used  hazardous substances at many of our facilities  and we have in the past  and may in the future  be subject to claims relating to exposure to hazardous materials and the associated liabilities may be material 
we also have generated  and continue to generate  hazardous wastes at a number of our facilities 
some of our facilities also have lengthy histories of manufacturing or other activities that have resulted in site contamination 
we have also given contractual indemnities for environmental conditions relating to facilities we no longer own or operate 
the nature of our business  including historical operations at our current and former facilities  exposes us to risks of liability under these laws and regulations due to the production  storage  use  transportation and sale of materials that can cause contamination or personal injury if released into the environment 
additional information may arise in the future concerning the nature or extent of our liability with respect to identified sites  and additional sites may be identified for which we are alleged to be liable  that could cause us to materially increase our environmental accrual or the upper range of the costs we believe we could reasonably incur for such matters 

albemarle kxxjpg 
contractual indemnities may be ineffective in protecting us from environmental liabilities 
at several of our properties where hazardous substances are known to exist including some sites where hazardous substances are being investigated or remediated  we believe we are entitled to contractual indemnification from one or more former owners or operators  however  in the event we make a claim  the indemnifier may disagree with us 
in  we commenced an arbitration proceeding against aventis sa concerning its obligations with respect to contamination at our thann  france facility after aventis refused to accept our demands for indemnification under the contract pursuant to which we acquired the facility 
if our contractual indemnity is not upheld  our accrual and or our costs for the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances could increase materially 
concern about the impact of some of our products on human health or the environment may lead to regulation  or reaction in our markets independent of regulation  that could reduce or eliminate markets for such products 
we manufacture or market a number of products that are or have been the subject of attention by regulatory authorities and environmental interest groups 
for example  for many years we have marketed methyl bromide  a chemical that is particularly effective as a soil fumigant 
in recent years  the market for methyl bromide has changed significantly  driven by the montreal protocol of and related regulation prompted by findings regarding the chemical s potential to deplete the ozone layer 
completion of the phase out of methyl bromide as a fumigant took effect january  with continued use for critical uses allowed on an annual basis until feasible alternatives are available 
in addition  there has been increased scrutiny by regulatory authorities and environmental interest groups of polybrominated diphenylethers  or pbdes  which are used as flame retardants 
we manufacture decabrom pde  a type of pbde compound 
in  our net sales of decabrom pde were less than of total net sales 
government regulation  if it occurs  or the threat of regulation  even if governmental regulation does not occur  may result in a decline in our net sales of decabrom pde 
we could be subject to damages based on claims brought against us by our customers or lose customers as a result of the failure of our products to meet certain quality specifications 
our products provide important performance attributes to our customers products 
if a product fails to perform in a manner consistent with quality specifications or has a shorter useful life than guaranteed  a customer could seek replacement of the product or damages for costs incurred as a result of the product failing to perform as guaranteed 
these risks apply to our refinery catalysts in particular because  in certain instances  we sell our refinery catalysts under agreements that contain limited performance and life cycle guarantees 
a successful claim or series of claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and could result in a loss of one or more customers 
our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and limit our ability to react to changes in our industry or to implement our strategic initiatives 
as of december   we had total indebtedness of million 
our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to us 
for example  it could require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures  research and development efforts and other general corporate purposes  limit our ability to secure additional financing to implement our strategic initiatives  increase the amount of our interest expense because approximately half of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest  which  if interest rates increase or our credit ratings decline  will result in higher interest expense  increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  place us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that may have proportionately less debt  restrict us from making strategic acquisitions  introducing new technologies or otherwise exploiting business opportunities  make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our existing indebtedness  and limit  along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness  among other things  our ability to borrow additional funds  dispose of assets or pay cash dividends 

albemarle kxxjpg 
in addition  we may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future 
the terms of our senior credit agreement and the indenture governing our senior notes due do not prohibit us from incurring substantial additional indebtedness 
if new debt is added to our current debt levels  the related risks that we now face could intensify 
we will need a significant amount of cash to service our indebtedness and our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control 
our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled payments on our debt depends on a range of economic  competitive and business factors  many of which are outside our control 
based on an average interest rate of at february  and outstanding borrowings at that date of million  our annual interest expense would be million 
a change of in the interest rate applicable to such borrowings would change our annualized interest expense by approximately million 
our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt obligations  particularly if currently anticipated cost savings and operating improvements are not realized on schedule or at all 
if we are unable to service our debt obligations  we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity  reduce or delay capital expenditures  sell assets or raise additional equity 
we may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness  sell assets or raise additional equity on commercially reasonable terms or at all  which could cause us to default on our obligations and impair our liquidity 
our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations  or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms  could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
restrictive covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect our business 
our senior credit agreement and the indenture governing the senior notes contain restrictive covenants 
these covenants provide constraints on our financial flexibility 
the failure to comply with the covenants in the senior credit agreement  the indenture governing the senior notes and the agreements governing other indebtedness  including indebtedness incurred in the future  could result in an event of default  which  if not cured or waived  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
a downgrading of the ratings on our debt or an increase in interest rates will cause our debt service obligations to increase 
borrowings under our senior credit agreement bear interest at floating rates 
the rates are subject to adjustment based on the ratings of our senior unsecured long term debt by standard poor s ratings services or s p and moody s investors services  or moody s 
s p has rated our senior unsecured long term debt as bbb and moody s has rated our senior unsecured long term debt as baa s p and or moody s may  in the future  downgrade our ratings 
the downgrading of our ratings or an increase in benchmark interest rates would result in an increase of our interest expense on borrowings under our senior credit agreement 
in addition  the downgrading of our ratings could adversely affect our future ability to obtain funding or materially increase the cost of any additional funding 
our business is subject to hazards common to chemical businesses  any of which could interrupt our production and adversely affect our results of operations 
our business is subject to hazards common to chemical manufacturing  storage  handling and transportation  including explosions  fires  inclement weather  natural disasters  mechanical failure  unscheduled downtime  transportation interruptions  remediation  chemical spills  discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases and other risks 
these hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life  severe damage to  or destruction of  property and equipment and environmental contamination 
in addition  the occurrence of material operating problems at our facilities due to any of these hazards may diminish our ability to meet our output goals 
accordingly  these hazards  and their consequences could have a material adverse effect on our operations as a whole  including our results of operations and cash flows  both during and after the period of operational difficulties 
the insurance that we maintain may not fully cover all potential exposures 
we maintain property  business interruption and casualty insurance but such insurance may not cover all risks associated with the hazards of our business and is subject to limitations  including deductibles and maximum liabilities covered 
we may incur losses beyond the limits  or outside the coverage  of our insurance policies  including liabilities for environmental remediation 
in addition  from time to time  various types of insurance for companies in the specialty chemical industry have not been available on commercially acceptable terms or  in some cases  have not been available at all 
in the future  we may not be able to obtain coverage at current levels  and our premiums may increase significantly on coverage that we maintain 
we may incur significant charges in the event we close all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility 
we periodically assess our manufacturing operations in order to manufacture and distribute our products in the most efficient manner 
based on our assessments  we may make capital improvements to modernize certain units  move manufacturing or 
albemarle kxxjpg 
distribution capabilities from one plant or facility to another plant or facility  discontinue manufacturing or distributing certain products or close all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility 
we also have shared services agreements at several of our plants and if such agreements are terminated or revised  we would assess and potentially adjust our manufacturing operations 
the closure of all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility could result in future charges which could be significant 
if we are unable to retain key personnel or attract new skilled personnel  it could have an adverse effect on our business 
the unanticipated departure of any key member of our management team could have an adverse effect on our business 
in addition  because of the specialized and technical nature of our business  our future performance is dependent on the continued service of  and on our ability to attract and retain  qualified management  scientific  technical  marketing and support personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  and we may be unable to continue to attract or retain such personnel 
some of our employees are unionized  represented by workers councils or are employed subject to local laws that are less favorable to employers than the laws of the united states 
as of december   we had approximately  employees 
approximately of our  us employees are unionized 
two of our collective bargaining agreements expire in and one expires in in addition  a large number of our employees are employed in countries in which employment laws provide greater bargaining or other rights to employees than the laws of the united states 
such employment rights require us to work collaboratively with the legal representatives of the employees to effect any changes to labor arrangements 
for example  most of our employees in europe are represented by workers councils that must approve any changes in conditions of employment  including salaries and benefits and staff changes  and may impede efforts to restructure our workforce 
although we believe that we have a good working relationship with our employees  a strike  work stoppage or slowdown by our employees or significant dispute with our employees could result in a significant disruption of our operations or higher ongoing labor costs 
our joint ventures may not operate according to their business plans if our partners fail to fulfill their obligations  which may adversely affect our results of operations and may force us to dedicate additional resources to these joint ventures 
we currently participate in a number of joint ventures and may enter into additional joint ventures in the future 
the nature of a joint venture requires us to share control with unaffiliated third parties 
if our joint venture partners do not fulfill their obligations  the affected joint venture may not be able to operate according to its business plan 
in that case  our results of operations may be adversely affected and we may be required to increase the level of our commitment to the joint venture 
also  differences in views among joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions or failures to agree on major issues 
if these differences cause the joint ventures to deviate from their business plans  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
we may not be able to consummate future acquisitions or integrate future acquisitions into our business  which could result in unanticipated expenses and losses 
as part of our business growth strategy  we have acquired businesses and entered into joint ventures in the past and intend to pursue acquisitions and joint venture opportunities in the future 
our ability to implement this component of our growth strategy will be limited by our ability to identify appropriate acquisition or joint venture candidates and our financial resources  including available cash and borrowing capacity 
the expense incurred in consummating acquisitions or entering into joint ventures  the time it takes to integrate an acquisition or our failure to integrate businesses successfully  could result in unanticipated expenses and losses 
furthermore  we may not be able to realize any of the anticipated benefits from acquisitions or joint ventures 
the process of integrating acquired operations into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require significant financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of existing operations 
some of the risks associated with the integration of acquisitions include potential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management  unforeseen claims and liabilities  including unexpected environmental exposures  unforeseen adjustments  charges and write offs  problems enforcing the indemnification obligations of sellers of businesses or joint venture partners for claims and liabilities  unexpected losses of customers of  or suppliers to  the acquired business  difficulty in conforming the acquired business standards  processes  procedures and controls with our operations  
albemarle kxxjpg 
variability in financial information arising from the implementation of purchase price accounting  inability to coordinate new product and process development  loss of senior managers and other critical personnel and problems with new labor unions  and challenges arising from the increased scope  geographic diversity and complexity of our operations 
although our pension plans are currently adequately funded  events could occur that would require us to make significant contributions to the plans and reduce the cash available for our business 
we have several defined benefit pension plans around the world  including in the united states  the netherlands  germany  belgium  france and japan  covering most of our employees 
the us plans represent approximately of the total liabilities of the plans worldwide 
we are required to make cash contributions to our pension plans to the extent necessary to comply with minimum funding requirements imposed by the various countries benefit and tax laws 
the amount of any such required contributions will be determined annually based on an actuarial valuation of the plans as performed by the plans actuaries 
during  we made no contributions to our us qualified defined benefit pension plans 
our us qualified defined benefit pension plans in aggregate were approximately funded on an irs funding basis as of december  and  as a result  there are no required cash contributions to the plans in however  the actual amount of contributions made subsequent to will depend upon asset returns  then current interest rates  and a number of other factors 
the amount we may elect or be required to contribute to our pension plans in the future may increase significantly 
specifically  if year end accumulated obligations exceed assets  we may elect to make a voluntary contribution  over and above the minimum required  in order to avoid additional minimum liability charges to our balance sheet and consequent reductions to shareholders equity 
these contributions could be substantial and would reduce the cash available for our business 
the occurrence or threat of extraordinary events  including domestic and international terrorist attacks  may disrupt our operations and decrease demand for our products 
chemical related assets may be at greater risk of future terrorist attacks than other possible targets in the united states  or us  and throughout the world 
as an acc member company  we have completed vulnerability assessments of our us manufacturing locations and met the requirements of this industry standard 
we have a corporate security standard and audit our facilities for compliance 
recent investments have been made to upgrade site security 
however  federal legislation is under consideration that could impose new site security requirements  specifically on chemical manufacturing facilities  which may increase our overhead expenses 
new federal regulations have already been adopted to increase the security of the transportation of hazardous chemicals in the united states 
we believe we have met these requirements but additional federal and local regulations that limit the distribution of hazardous materials are being considered 
we ship and receive materials that are classified as hazardous 
bans on movement of hazardous materials through cities like washington  dc could affect the efficiency of our logistical operations 
broader restrictions on hazardous material movements could lead to additional investment to produce hazardous raw materials and change where and what products we manufacture 
the occurrence of extraordinary events  including future terrorist attacks and the outbreak or escalation of hostilities  cannot be predicted  and their occurrence can be expected to continue to affect negatively the economy in general  and specifically the markets for our products 
the resulting damage from a direct attack on our assets  or assets used by us  could include loss of life and property damage 
in addition  available insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all of the damage incurred or  if available  may be prohibitively expensive

item legal proceedings 
on april   albemarle overseas development company  or aodc  one of our wholly owned subsidiaries  initiated a request for arbitration against aventis sa  the predecessor in interest to sanofi aventis  or aventis  through the international chamber of commerce  international court of arbitration  paris  france 
the dispute arises out of a stock purchase agreement  or agreement  between aodc and a predecessor to aventis under which of the stock of potasse et produits chimiques  sa  now known as albemarle ppc  or appc  was acquired by aodc 
the dispute relates to a chemical facility in thann  france  owned by appc  where the french government has required a detailed risk study of groundwater contamination  and in instructed appc to conduct a number of additional tests and studies and take certain measures with respect to the containment of certain contamination at and the emission of certain materials from the thann facility 
by reason of certain intervening assignments of rights  albemarle france sas  another wholly owned subsidiary of albemarle corporation  was substituted for adoc as the party in interest in the arbitration 
the request for arbitration requests indemnification by aventis for certain costs incurred by appc  in connection with any environmental claims of the french government for the appc facility and a declaratory judgment as to the liability of aventis under the agreement for costs to be incurred in the future by appc in connection with such claims 
under the terms of the agreement  we believe that aventis is obligated to indemnify aodc and appc  and hold them harmless from certain claims  losses  damages  costs or any other present or prospective liabilities arising out of certain soil and groundwater contamination at the site in thann 
arbitration hearings related to the question of liability took place in june and we currently expect a response from the arbitration panel in at this time  it is not possible to predict what additional studies or measures  if any  the french government may require since these matters are in the initial stages and environmental matters are subject to many uncertainties 
we believe  however  that we are entitled to be fully indemnified by aventis for all liabilities arising from these matters  but no assurance can be given that we will prevail in the arbitration 
if we do not prevail in the arbitration and the government requires additional remediation  the costs of remediation could be significant 
in addition  we are involved from time to time in legal proceedings of types regarded as common in our businesses  particularly administrative or judicial proceedings seeking remediation under environmental laws  such as superfund  products liability and premises liability litigation 
we maintain a financial accrual for these proceedings that includes defense costs and potential damages  as estimated by our general counsel 
we also maintain insurance to mitigate certain of such risks

forward looking statements some of the information presented in this annual report on form k  including the documents incorporated by reference  may constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of such forward looking statements are based on our current expectations  which are in turn based on assumptions that we believe are reasonable based on our current knowledge of our business and operations 
we have used words such as anticipate  believe  could  estimate  expect  intend  may  should  will and variations of such words and similar expressions to identify such forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions  which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control 
there can be no assurance  therefore  that our actual results will not differ materially from the results and expectations expressed or implied in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include  without limitation the timing of orders received from customers  the gain or loss of significant customers  competition from other manufacturers  changes in the demand for our products  increases in the cost of raw materials and energy  and our inability to pass through such increases  changes in our markets in general

fluctuations in foreign currencies  changes in laws and regulations  the occurrence of claims or litigation  the inability to maintain current levels of product or premises liability insurance or the denial of such coverage  political unrest affecting the global economy  including adverse effects from terrorism or hostilities  changes in accounting standards  the inability to achieve results from our global manufacturing cost reduction initiatives as well as our ongoing continuous improvement and rationalization programs  changes in interest rates  to the extent they affect our ability to raise capital or increase our cost of funds  have an impact on the overall performance of our pension fund investments and increase our pension expense and funding obligations  and the other factors detailed from time to time in the reports we file with the sec 
we assume no obligation to provide revisions to any forward looking statements should circumstances change  except as otherwise required by securities and other applicable laws 
the following discussion should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report on form k 
changes in reporting segments our polymer additives segment is comprised of the flame retardants and stabilizers and curatives product areas 
our catalysts segment is comprised of the refinery catalysts and polyolefin catalysts product areas 
our fine chemicals segment is comprised of the performance chemicals and fine chemistry services and intermediates product areas 
effective january   we revised the way we evaluate the performance of our segment results to reflect the manner in which the chief operating decision makers now review our three segments 
we now include the operating results of our joint ventures termed equity in net income losses of unconsolidated investments along with our operating profit  which represents income before income taxes  minority interests  equity in net income losses of unconsolidated investments and cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  net and before interest and financing expenses and other income expenses  net 
the change to segment income versus segment operating profit was brought about by the material effect of the refinery catalysts business joint ventures acquired in july on our consolidated operating results 
segment data continues to include intersegment transfers of raw materials at cost and foreign exchange transaction gains and losses  as well as allocations for certain corporate costs 
segment results including effective income tax rate calculations for years and have been reclassified to reflect the impact of the revisions 
in addition  effective august   we began consolidating our ownership interest in jordan bromine company limited  or jbc  a jordanian american joint venture company that manufactures and markets bromine and bromine derivatives products from raw materials extracted from the dead sea 
we previously accounted for this investment on the equity basis 
however  as a result of august amendments to the related joint venture agreement  our management concluded that consolidation accounting for this investment was appropriate under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  or gaap 
this change in accounting has no impact on our net income 
segment results for the seven months ended july  and years and were not restated for the impact of this change 
other income expenses  net effective july  we reclassified our minority ownership interest in stannica llc from other income expenses  net to a separate disclosure line entitled minority interests in income of consolidated subsidiaries in the consolidated statements of income 
reclassifications have been made herein for years and totaling million and million  respectively  to reflect the change 
the following is a discussion and analysis and results of operations for the years ended december   and a discussion of consolidated financial condition and sources of additional capital is included under a separate heading financial condition and liquidity on page 
albemarle kxxjpg 
overview and outlook we are a leading global developer  manufacturer and marketer of highly engineered specialty chemicals 
our products and services enhance the value of our customers end products by improving performance  providing essential product attributes  lowering cost and simplifying processing 
we sell a highly diversified mix of products to a wide range of customers  including manufacturers of consumer electronics  building and construction materials  automotive parts  packaging  pharmachemicals and agrichemicals  and petroleum refiners 
we believe that our commercial and geographic diversity  technical expertise  flexible  low cost global manufacturing base  and experienced management team enable us to maintain leading market positions in those areas of the specialty chemicals industry in which we operate 
growth of our polymer additives segment is expected to be derived from increasing demand for electrical and electronic equipment  new construction and increasingly stringent fire safety regulations in many countries around the world 
growth in our catalysts segment is expected to be driven by increasing demand for petroleum products  generally deteriorating quality of crude oil feedstock and implementation of more stringent fuel quality requirements as a part of anti pollution initiatives 
the fine chemicals segment continues to benefit from the continued rapid pace of innovation and the introduction of new products  coupled with a movement by pharmaceutical companies to outsource certain research  product development and manufacturing functions 
highlights refinery catalysts integration 
we focused on the integration of our new refinery catalysts business into our operations and culture 
our new catalysts segment represented approximately of our net sales 
with one full year behind us  we believe that this new segment is now fully integrated into our business model 
record safety and environmental performance 
we improved our safety performance by more than in compared to in addition  our manufacturing operations environmental performance improved over 
continued focus on cost savings 
we achieved our three year million manufacturing cost savings goal  primarily through workforce reductions  plant cost reductions and raw material utilization reductions 
raw material headwinds 
we faced substantial increases in raw material and energy costs 
to offset these costs  we worked diligently to avoid margin erosion by actively managing our supply chain  increasing prices and implementing raw material surcharges for our products 
technology advances 
we continued to leverage our technological expertise by developing and introducing new products 
in  sales from new products introduced in the last five years represented approximately of our total net sales 
consolidation of jbc 
we consolidated this joint venture due to an amendment to the operating agreement 
decabrom exemption from rohs 
the european union exempted decabrom from its restriction of hazardous substances rohs directive after numerous scientific tests supported the heath safety of this flame retardant 
pension plan changes 
we announced plans to move away from a defined benefit pension plan for all employees beginning in all new employees are enrolled in a defined contribution plan 
debt reduction 
we reduced our total debt by over million  lowering our debt to capitalization ratio to approximately 
increased dividends 
we increased our dividends for the th consecutive year  ending the year at an annual dividend rate of per share 
outlook polymer additives polymer additives volumes were flat in after record growth in and we expect volumes in to meet or exceed those in we will continue our focus on restoring margins in this segment and will continue to drive price increases where warranted 
we announced to price increases for brominated flame retardants effective april  and announced mineral flame retardant increases effective the same date 
key raw materials needed to manufacture these products continue to rise  forcing us to raise prices to offset these costs 
we expect that our technology center in nanjing  china will be operational in  allowing us to provide polymer additives technical customer support in the asia pacific region 
we will also use this facility to repackage aluminum alkyls 
we believe that this location will provide us with solid footing in china to further expand our operations in this area 

albemarle kxxjpg 
we will continue our efforts to educate manufacturers and the public about the safety and benefits of our flame retardants 
in early  the us consumer product safety commission mandated flammability standards for mattresses that could support greater demand for the use of flame retardants  depending on how manufacturers elect to flame retard their mattresses 
in addition  various groups continue to evaluate the safety of brominated flame retardants and we intend to continue our support of sound scientific testing of these materials 
catalysts we expect hpc volumes to remain robust in as new diesel sulfur specifications go into effect mid year 
in addition  as oil prices remain elevated  refiners will use more sour crudes  which will require hpc catalysts to remove the metals and impurities  further driving demand for these catalysts 
we have begun construction on our new hpc plant at bayport  texas  which is expected to be operational in late this plant will add  metric tons to our capacity 
our focus in fcc catalysts is on improving margins by driving price increases to support the value these products bring to the market 
in  we announced the first significant price increase for these catalysts in over ten years and will focus intently in on achieving these increases 
we believe that this price increase  along with announced surcharges  will help offset the continuing raw material and energy costs to manufacture these catalysts and will allow margin recovery and expansion for this key catalyst 
we are focused on new product development in catalysts  and have introduced high throughput experimentation to more rapidly test and develop new technologies 
our marketing and research groups are tightly aligned so we can continue to bring innovative technologies to the market 
we will continue to explore new opportunities for our catalysts in the rapidly growing gas to liquids gtl and coal to liquids ctl markets  which remain viable as oil remains at historically high levels 
fine chemicals we expect to continue the turnaround of our fine chemicals portfolio in we are implementing the announced shutdown of our seawater bromine facility in france  and will continue evaluating other assets as we seek to improve the margins in this segment 
we are optimistic for the prospects of our single site plant in orangeburg  south carolina  that we recently converted into a multi purpose asset  enabling us to take advantage of new products commercializing from our r d pipeline 
we will continue to explore other similar ways to profitably redeploy assets where possible 
in addition to an overall focus on margin improvement  our two strategic areas of focus in fine chemicals will be to maximize our bromine franchise value and to continue the growth of our fine chemistry services business 
our goal is to profitably grow our globally competitive  bromine and derivatives production network to serve all major bromine consuming products and markets 
we will also continue our focus on developing our fine chemistry services business 
our new products pipeline in this business has approximately doubled in the last three years  allowing us to develop preferred outsourcing positions serving leading chemical innovators in diverse industries 
we remain confident in continuing to generate growth in profitable niche products leveraged from this service business

summary of critical accounting policies estimates and assumptions the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
listed below are the estimates and assumptions that we consider to be significant in the preparation of the financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we estimate losses for uncollectible accounts based on the aging of receivables and the evaluation of the likelihood of success in collecting the receivables 
we also provide for claims receivables that are subject to legal proceedings 
depreciation 
depreciation is computed primarily by the straight line method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets 
we have a policy where our internal engineering group provides asset life guidelines for book purposes 
these guidelines are reviewed against the economic life of the business for each project  and asset life is determined as the lesser of the manufacturing life or the business life 
the engineering guidelines are reviewed periodically 
inventory obsolescence 
inventories are reviewed on a quarterly basis to determine age  movement and turnover 
reserves are setup periodically based upon estimates to adjust inventory values in line with their net realizable value 
recovery of long lived assets 
we evaluate the recovery of our long lived assets on a segment basis by periodically analyzing our operating results and considering significant events or changes in the business environment 
acquisition accounting 
we estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities when allocating the purchase price of an acquisition 
income taxes 
we assume the deductibility of certain costs in our income tax filings and estimate the future recovery of deferred tax assets 
legal accruals 
we estimate the amount of potential exposure and anticipated cost to defend that we may incur with respect to litigation  claims and assessments 
performance and life cycle guarantees 
we provide customers certain performance guarantees and life cycle guarantees 
these guarantees entitle the customer to claim compensation if the product does not conform to performance standards originally agreed upon 
performance guarantees relate to minimum technical specifications that products produced with the delivered product must meet  such as yield and product quality 
life cycle guarantees relate to minimum periods for which performance of the delivered product is guaranteed 
when either performance guarantees or life cycle guarantees are contractually agreed upon  an assessment of the appropriate revenue recognition treatment is evaluated 
environmental remediation liabilities 
we estimate and accrue the costs required to remediate a specific site depending on site specific facts and circumstances 
cost estimates to remediate each specific site are developed by assessing the scope of our contribution to the environmental matter  the scope of the anticipated remediation and monitoring plan  and the extent of other parties share of responsibility 
actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize sales when the revenue is realized or realizable  and has been earned  in accordance with the sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
we recognize net sales as risk and title to the product transfer to the customer  which usually occurs at the time shipment is made 
the majority of our sales are sold free on board fob shipping point or on an equivalent basis  other transactions are based upon specific contractual arrangements 
our standard terms of delivery are generally included in our contracts of sale  order confirmation documents and invoices 
we recognize revenue from services when performance of the services has been completed 
we have a limited amount of consignment sales that are billed to the customer upon monthly notification of amounts used by the customers under these contracts 
claims receivable we record receivables for non trade claims on a case by case basis whenever management deems that the claim for recovery is probable 
recording of such receivables is preceded by the gathering and evaluation of factually supportable evidence and conditions 
albemarle kxxjpg 
surrounding the claim  and is generally based on application of specific contractual terms with third parties from which the claim arises 
in accordance with gaap  we evaluate these receivables for collectibility on a regular basis  and we record provisions for uncollectible amounts when subsequent conditions indicate that collection of all or part of the receivable is not probable 
goodwill and other intangible assets we account for goodwill and other intangibles acquired in a business combination in conformity with sfas  no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires that goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets no longer be amortized 
we test goodwill for impairment using a two step method by comparing the estimated fair value of our reporting units to the related carrying value 
we measure the fair value based on present value techniques involving cash flows consistent with the objective of measuring fair value based on reasonable and supportive assumptions 
we test our recorded goodwill balances for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year or upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying amounts 
definite lived intangible assets  such as purchased technology  patents  customer lists and trademarks are amortized over their estimated useful lives  generally for periods ranging from three to thirty five years 
we continually evaluate the reasonableness of the useful lives of these assets 
see note  goodwill and other intangibles 
pension plans and other postretirement benefits we follow the guidance of sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  when accounting for pension and postretirement benefits 
under these accounting standards  assumptions are made regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets 
delayed recognition of differences between actual results and expected or estimated results is a guiding principle of these standards 
this delayed recognition of actual results allows for the recognition of changes in benefit obligations and plan performance over the working lives of the employees who benefit under the plans 
the primary assumptions are as follows discount rate the discount rate is used in calculating the present value of benefits  which is based on projections of benefit payments to be made in the future 
expected return on plan assets we project the future return on plan assets based on prior performance and future expectations for the types of investments held by the plans as well as the expected long term allocation of plan assets for these investments 
these projected returns reduce the net benefit costs recorded currently 
rate of compensation increase for salary related plans  we project employees annual pay increases  which are used to project employees pension benefits at retirement 
rate of increase in the per capita of covered health care benefits we project the expected increases in the cost of covered health care benefits 
during  we made changes to the assumptions related to the discount rate  the rate of compensation increase for salary related plans and the rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits 
we consider available information that we deem relevant when selecting each of these assumptions 
in selecting the discount rate  consideration is given to fixed income security yields  including high quality bonds moody s aa and the international index company  or iboxx  aa corporate bond rates  along with a yield curve applied to the payments we expect to make out of our retirement plans 
the yield curve was produced for a universe containing us issued aa graded corporate bonds  all of which were non callable  non putable  and non sinkable 
for each plan  the discount rate was developed as the level equivalent rate that would produce the same present value as that using spot rates aligned with the projected benefit payments 
at december   the weighted average discount rate was reduced for the plans from to as a result of decreased yields for long term high quality bonds 
in estimating the expected return on plan assets  we consider past performance and future expectations for the types of investments held by the plan as well as the expected long term allocation of plan assets to these investments 
at december   the weighted average expected rate of return on pension plan assets was reduced from to and there was no change in the weighted average expected return on other postretirement benefit plan assets 
our us defined benefit plan for non represented employees was closed to new participants effective march  we adopted a defined contribution pension plan for us employees hired after march  
albemarle kxxjpg 
in projecting the rate of compensation increase  we consider past experience in light of movements in inflation rates 
at december  and  the assumed weighted average rate of compensation increase was and  respectively  for the pension plans 
in selecting the rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits  we consider past performance and forecasts of future health care cost trends 
at december   the previously assumed rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits for us retirees was increased 
the assumed health care cost trend rate for for pre coverage was per year  dropping by per year to an ultimate rate of  while the trend rate for post coverage was per year  dropping by per year to an ultimate rate of 
the assumed health care cost trend rate for for pre coverage was per year  dropping by per year to an ultimate rate of  the trend rate for post coverage was per year  dropping by per year to an ultimate rate of 
for  the trend rate for pre coverage is per year  dropping by per year to an ultimate rate of  the trend rate for post coverage is per year  dropping by per year to an ultimate rate of 
the postretirement medical benefits provided to employees in the netherlands who retire after august includes an assumed increase in benefits of per year 
the effect of a increase in the us health care cost trend rate would increase the total service and interest components by million and would increase the benefit obligation by million 
a decrease in the us heath care cost trend rate would decrease the total service and interest components by million and would decrease the benefit obligation by million 
a variance in the assumptions discussed above would have an impact on the projected benefit obligations  the accrued other postretirement benefit liabilities  and the annual net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit cost 
the following table reflects the sensitivities associated with a hypothetical change in certain assumptions  primarily in the united states 
albemarle kxxjpg 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts 
we believe that our accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open years  based on our assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law applied to the facts of each matter  which result primarily from intercompany transfer pricing  tax benefits from the foreign sales corporation and extraterritorial income tax rules 
we are subject to periodic audit of our income tax returns by tax authorities 
in the united states  the internal revenue service has completed a review of our income tax returns through the year for the years after  our income tax returns are either under review or could be subject to review 
except as otherwise noted  it is our policy to record deferred income tax liabilities on our undistributed earnings of foreign operations that are not deemed to be permanently reinvested in those operations 
our foreign earnings are computed under us federal tax earnings and profits  or e p  principles 
in general  to the extent our financial reporting book basis over tax basis of a foreign subsidiary exceeds these e p amounts  deferred taxes have not been recorded as they are essentially permanent in duration 
the determination of the amount of such unrecognized defered tax liability is not practicable 
as further discussed in note  we have asserted that we are permanently reinvested with respect to earnings derived from our investment in jbc for all periods beginning after september  investments we have investments in joint ventures  nonmarketable securities and marketable equity securities 
the majority of our investments are in joint ventures 
since we have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of these joint ventures  they are accounted for using the equity method of accounting 
significant influence is generally deemed to exist if 
albemarle kxxjpg 
we have an ownership interest in the voting stock of the investee between and  although other factors  such as representation on the investee s board of directors and the impact of commercial arrangements  are considered in determining whether the equity method of accounting is appropriate 
our share of the investee s earnings losses are included in the consolidated statement of income as equity in net income losses of unconsolidated investments 
it is also included in our computation of segment income 
investments in marketable securities are accounted for as both available for sale securities with changes in fair value included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the shareholders equity section of the consolidated balance sheets and trading equities that are marked to market on a monthly basis through the consolidated statement of income 
joint ventures and nonmarketable securities results for immaterial entities are estimated based upon the overall performance of the entity where financial results are not available on a timely basis 
internal control over financial reporting section of the sarbanes oxley act of or sox  requires that we make an assertion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in our annual report on form k filings 
our independent registered public accounting firm  pricewaterhousecoopers llp  attests to our management s assertion and provides its assessment of our effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting 
in order to make our assertion  we are required to identify material financial and operational processes  document internal controls supporting the financial reporting process and evaluate the design and effectiveness of these controls 
see management s report on internal control over financial reporting in part i  item a 
we have a dedicated sox team in house to facilitate ongoing internal control reviews  coordinate the process for these reviews  provide direction to the business groups and corporate staff involved in the initiative and assist in the assessment of internal control over financial reporting 
a steering committee  comprised of personnel from finance and alliances services  is in place to set uniform guiding principles and policies  review the progress of the compliance activities and direct the efforts of the sox team 
status updates are provided to our audit committee of our board of directors on an ongoing basis 
we also retain an accounting firm other than our independent registered public accounting firm to assist us in our compliance with sox our sox effort involves many of our employees around the world  including participation by our business areas and our alliance services group 
we view our ongoing evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting as more than a regulatory exercise it is an opportunity to continually assess our financial control environment and make us even stronger 
financial condition and liquidity 
our cash balance increased by million to million at december  from million at december  for  our continuing operations provided million of cash compared to providing cash of million in primarily due to increases in working capital as a result of operational growth of all of our operating segments 
cash flows from operating activities funded investing activities of million  which consisted principally of capital expenditures for plant machinery and equipment improvements 
cash flows from operating activities and proceeds from the issuance of senior notes and common stock of million and million  respectively  funded long term debt repayments of million and quarterly dividends to shareholders resulting in net cash used by financing activity of million 
working capital increased million to million at december  from million at december  the increase in working capital is related to increased activity and is due primarily to an increase in cash  accounts receivable and inventory partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
cash and cash equivalents at december  were million  up million from million at year end for  cash flows provided from operating activities of million  together with approximately billion of proceeds from borrowings and million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options  were used to cover operating activities  make acquisitions totaling million  net of cash acquired  repay debt of million  fund capital expenditures totaling million  pay quarterly dividends to shareholders of million  fund investments amounting to million  fund million of realized euro denominated hedging losses and pay million of financing costs associated with the acquisition of the refinery catalysts business  purchase  shares of our common stock  and increase cash and cash equivalents by million 
we anticipate that cash provided from operating activities in the future and borrowings under our senior credit agreement will be sufficient to pay our operating expenses  satisfy debt service obligations  fund capital expenditures and make dividend payments 
on october   we filed a universal shelf registration statement on form s with the sec covering million of securities 
the shelf registration will permit us to issue from time to time a range of securities  including common stock  preferred stock and senior and subordinated debt 
on january   we completed the concurrent public offerings of  shares of our common stock of which an aggregate of  shares were sold by a member of the family of fd gottwald  jr 
and certain affiliates of the family  and million of senior notes due we did not receive any proceeds from the sale of these 
albemarle kxxjpg 
shares by the selling shareholders 
our portion of the common stock offering sale  after the inclusion of  over allotment shares requested and sold by our underwriters  which was completed on january   totaled  shares 
the shares of common stock were offered and sold at a public offering price of per share and the senior notes were offered and sold at a public offering price of of par 
we used the net proceeds from both offerings of million to repay the million day bridge loan that we incurred in connection with our acquisition of the refinery catalysts business 
following the completion of the concurrent public offerings  we had approximately million of securities available for issuance under the registration statement 
the notes are our senior unsecured obligations and will rank equally with all of our other senior unsecured indebtedness from time to time outstanding 
the senior notes will be effectively subordinated to any of our future secured indebtedness and to existing and future indebtedness of our subsidiaries 
we may redeem the senior notes before their maturity  in whole at any time or in part from time to time  at a redemption price equal to the greater of of the principal amount of the senior notes to be redeemed or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption discounted to the redemption date on a semi annual basis assuming a day year consisting of twelve day months at the treasury rate as defined in the indenture governing the senior notes plus basis points  plus  in each case  accrued interest thereon to the date of redemption 
the principal amount of the senior notes becomes immediately due and payable upon the occurrence of certain bankruptcy or insolvency events involving us or certain of our subsidiaries and may be declared immediately due and payable by the trustee or the holders of not less than of the senior notes upon the occurrence of an event of default 
events of default include  among other things failure to pay principal or interest at required times  failure to perform or remain in breach of covenants within prescribed periods  an event of default on any of our other indebtedness or certain of our subsidiaries of million or more that is caused by a failure to make a payment when due or that results in the acceleration of that indebtedness before its maturity  and certain bankruptcy or insolvency events involving us or certain of our subsidiaries 
in connection with the acquisition of the refinery catalysts business  we entered into a new senior credit agreement consisting of a million revolving credit facility and a million five year term loan facility  and a million day loan agreement  which we repaid with the net proceeds from our concurrent public offerings of shares of our common stock and senior notes 
all of our borrowings in under the million revolving credit facility  the million five year term loan facility and day loan agreement bore interest at variable rates based on an average libor rate for deposits in the relevant currency plus an applicable rate currently 
the applicable rate was variable based on the rating of our senior unsecured long term debt by standard poors and moody s 
as of december   borrowings under the million five year term loan facility bore a variable interest rate of per annum 
as of december   borrowings under the million revolving credit facility  million five year term loan facility and day loan agreement bore variable interest rates of  and  respectively  per annum 
borrowings under our senior credit agreement are conditioned upon compliance with the following financial covenants a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio  as defined  must be greater than or equal to as of the end of any fiscal quarter  b consolidated debt to capitalization ratio  as defined  at the end of any fiscal quarter must be less than or equal to  c consolidated tangible domestic assets  as defined  must be or greater than or equal to million for us to make investments in entities and enterprises that are organized outside the united states  and d with the exception of liens specified in our new senior credit agreement  liens may not attach to assets where the aggregate amount of all indebtedness secured by such liens at any time exceeds of consolidated net worth  as defined in the agreements 
at december   our consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio was 
at december   the noncurrent portion of our long term debt amounted to million 
our long term debt  including the current portion and short term borrowings  as a percentage of total capitalization  amounted to 
in addition  we had the ability to borrow an additional million under our various credit arrangements 
at december   our foreign currency translation adjustments  net of related deferred taxes  included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the consolidated statement of changes in shareholders equity on page decreased from december   primarily due to the strengthening of the us dollar against the euro 
capital expenditures in of million were higher than the level of million 
our capital spending program in is expected to be approximately million with expenditures expected to expand capacities at existing facilities to support an expected increase in sales 
we expect our capital spending program to be approximately to million in and capital spending in for environmental and safety projects is expected to approximate that of  which was somewhat higher than that in due to the increase in the number of manufacturing facilities 
we anticipate that future capital spending will be 
albemarle kxxjpg 
financed primarily with cash flow provided from operations with additional cash needed  if any  provided by borrowings  including borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
the amount and timing of any additional borrowings will depend on our specific cash requirements 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations for plant construction  purchases of equipment  unused letters of credit  and various take or pay and throughput agreements

capitalization on january   we completed the concurrent public offerings of  shares of our common stock of which an aggregate of  shares were sold by a member of the family of fd gottwald  jr 
and certain affiliates of the family  and million of senior notes due we did not receive any proceeds from the sale of these shares by the selling shareholders 
our portion of the common stock offering sale  after the inclusion of  over allotment shares requested and sold by our underwriters  which was completed on january   totaled  shares 
the shares of common stock were offered and sold at a public offering price of per share and the senior notes were offered and sold at a public offering price of of par 
we used the net proceeds from both of our offerings to repay the million day bridge loan that we incurred in connection with our acquisition of the refinery catalysts business 
safety and environmental matters we are subject to federal  state  local and foreign requirements regulating the handling  manufacture and use of materials some of which may be classified as hazardous or toxic by one or more regulatory agencies  the discharge of materials into the environment and the protection of the environment 
to our knowledge  we are currently complying and expect to continue to comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws  regulations  statutes and ordinances 
compliance with existing federal  state  local and foreign environmental protection laws is not expected to have in the future a material effect on earnings or our competitive position  but increased legal or regulatory requirements could have an adverse effect on our results 
among other environmental requirements  we are subject to the federal superfund law  and similar state laws  under which we may be designated as a potentially responsible party  or prp  and may be liable for a share of the costs associated with cleaning up various hazardous waste sites 
management believes that in most cases  our participation is de minimis 
further  almost all such sites represent environmental issues that are quite mature and have been investigated  studied and in many cases settled 
in de minimis situations  our policy generally is to negotiate a consent decree and to pay any apportioned settlement  enabling us to be effectively relieved of any further liability as a prp  except for remote contingencies 
in other than de minimis prp matters  our records indicate that unresolved prp exposures should be immaterial 
we accrue and expense our proportionate share of prp costs 
because management has been actively involved in evaluating environmental matters  we are able to conclude that the outstanding environmental liabilities for unresolved prp sites should not be material to operations 
our environmental and safety operating costs charged to expense were approximately million in versus approximately million in and million in  excluding depreciation of previous capital expenditures  and are expected to be in the same range in the next few years 
costs for remediation have been accrued and payments related to sites are charged against accrued liabilities  which at december  totaled approximately million  down million from december  
albemarle kxxjpg 
we believe that most of the amount we may be required to pay in connection with environmental remediation and asset retirement obligation matters in excess of the amounts recorded  if any  should occur over a period of time and should not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations  but could have a material adverse impact in any particular quarterly reporting period 
capital expenditures for pollution abatement and safety projects  including such costs that are included in other projects  were approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
for each of the next few years  capital expenditures for these types of projects may increase due to more stringent regulatory requirements 
management s estimates of the effects of compliance with governmental pollution abatement and safety regulations are subject to i the possibility of changes in the applicable statutes and regulations or in judicial or administrative construction of such statutes and regulations  and ii uncertainty as to whether anticipated solutions to pollution problems will be successful  or whether additional expenditures may prove necessary

this statement requires that those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal which was the criterion specified in arb no 
in addition  this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the cost of production be based on normal capacity of the production facilities

this revision will require us to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
the cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
we currently use the intrinsic value method from apb no 
to measure compensation expense for stock based awards to our employees 
under this standard  we generally do not recognize any compensation related to stock option grants we issue under our incentive plans 
under the new rules  we are required to adopt a fair value based method for measuring the compensation expense related to incentive stock awards

this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of operations  we are exposed to changes in financial market conditions due to the denomination of our business transactions in diverse foreign currencies and our ongoing manufacturing and funding activities 
as a result  future earnings  cash flows and fair values of assets and liabilities are subject to market risk 
we have established policies  procedures and internal processes governing our management of uncertain market conditions  and we use both operational and financial market actions in our risk management activities  which include the use of derivative instruments 
we do not use derivative instruments for trading purposes 
we only enter into derivative contracts based on economic analysis of underlying exposures anticipating that adverse impacts on future earnings  cash flows and fair values due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates will be offset by the proceeds from and changes in fair value of the derivative instruments 
we do not hedge our exposure to market risks in a manner that completely eliminates the effects of changing market conditions on earnings  cash flows and fair values 
short term exposures to changing foreign currency exchange rates are primarily due to operating cash flows denominated in foreign currencies 
we cover certain known and anticipated operating exposures by using forward contracts 

albemarle kxxjpg 
the primary currencies for which we have foreign currency exchange rate exposure are the euro  japanese yen  british pound sterling and the us dollar in certain of its foreign locations 
in response to the greater fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in recent periods  we have increased the degree of risk management activities to minimize the impact on earnings of future periods 
we manage our foreign currency exposures by balancing certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and through the use  from time to time  of foreign currency forward contracts 
the principal objective of these contracts is to minimize the risks and or costs associated with global operating activities 
we do not use financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
the counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions with which we generally have other financial relationships 
we enter into foreign currency forward contracts  which generally expire within one year  in the regular course of business to assist in managing our exposure against foreign currency fluctuations on sales and intercompany transactions 
the primary method to cover foreign currency exposure is to seek a natural hedge  in which the operating activities denominated in respective currencies balance in respect to timing and the underlying exposures 
in the event a natural hedge is not available  a foreign currency forward contract may be employed to reduce currency exposure 
while these contracts are subject to fluctuations in value  such fluctuations are generally offset by the value of the underlying foreign currency exposures being hedged 
gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts are recognized currently in income 
our financial instruments  subject to foreign currency exchange risk  consist of foreign currency forward contracts and represented a net asset position of million at december  we conducted a sensitivity analysis on the fair value of our foreign currency hedge portfolio assuming instantaneous changes in foreign currency exchange rates from their levels as of december   with all other variables held constant 
a appreciation of the us dollar against foreign currencies would result in an increase of million in the fair value of our foreign currency exchange hedging contracts 
a depreciation of the us dollar against foreign currencies would result in a decrease of million in the fair value of our foreign currency exchange hedging contracts 
the sensitivity in fair value of our foreign currency hedge portfolio represents changes in fair values estimated based on market conditions as of december   without reflecting the effects of underlying anticipated transactions 
when those anticipated transactions are realized  actual effects of changing foreign currency exchange rates could have a material impact on our earnings and cash flows in future periods 
in connection with the acquisition of the refinery catalysts business  we entered into foreign currency forward hedging contracts to partially hedge the purchase price  which was denominated in euros 
as a result  we incurred a net charge of approximately million during the year ended december  we are exposed to changes in interest rates that could impact our results of operations and financial condition 
we manage the worldwide exposure of our interest rate risks and foreign exchange exposure through our regular operations and financing activities 
we had outstanding variable interest rate borrowings at december  of million  bearing an average interest rate of 
a change of in the interest rate applicable to these borrowings would change our annualized interest expense by approximately million 
we intend to use our senior credit agreement as the primary source of financing supplemented by several uncommitted line agreements  which could expose us to changes in interest rates  if various financial covenants are not met 
we manage our ratio of debt to capitalization with the objective of achieving the lowest cost of capital possible 
our raw materials are subject to price volatility caused by weather  supply conditions  political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors 
historically  we have not used futures  options and swap contracts to manage the volatility related to the above exposures 
however  the refinery catalysts business has used financing arrangements certain of which contain embedded derivatives to provide long term protection against changes in metals prices 
we seek to limit our exposure by entering into long term contracts when available  and we seek price increase limitations through contracts 
due to the increase in our outstanding indebtedness as a result of the acquisition of the refinery catalysts business  we may enter into interest rate swaps  collars or similar instruments with the objective of reducing interest rate volatility relating to our borrowing costs 
in  we entered into treasury lock agreements  or t locks  with a notional value of million  to fix the yield on the us treasury security used to set the yield for approximately of our january public offering of senior notes 
the t locks fixed the yield on the us treasury security at approximately 
the value of the t locks resulted from the difference between the yield to maturity of the year us treasury security that had the maturity date most comparable to the maturity date of the notes issued and the fixed rate of approximately 
the cumulative loss effect of the t lock agreements was million and is being amortized over the life of the notes as an adjustment to the notes interest expense 
at december   there were unrealized losses of approximately million million after income taxes in accumulated other comprehensive income loss that remain to be expensed 

albemarle kxxjpg 
in addition  certain of our operations use natural gas as a source of energy which can expose our business to market risk when the price of natural gas changes suddenly 
in an attempt to mitigate the impact and volatility of price swings in the natural gas market  we purchase natural gas contracts  when appropriate  for a portion of our month rolling forecast for north american natural gas requirements 
our natural gas hedge transactions are executed with a major financial institution 
such derivatives are held to secure natural gas at fixed prices and not for trading 
our natural gas contracts qualify as cash flow hedges and are marked to market 
the unrealized gains and or losses on them are deferred and accounted for in accumulated other comprehensive income loss to the extent that the unrealized gains and losses are offset by the forecasted transaction 
at december   there were no natural gas hedge contracts outstanding 
additionally  any unrealized gains and or losses on the derivative instrument that are not offset by the forecasted transaction are recorded in earnings as appropriate
