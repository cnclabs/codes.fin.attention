note restructuring expense of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the fiscal year decrease in income from continuing operations was primarily attributable to a decline in gross profit as a percent of sales which was driven by tighter margins on products due to competitive pricing pressures and a sales mix shift among various products to those with lower margins along with increased employee benefit expenses 
acquisitions completed during fiscal year also had the effect of lowering this segment s gross profit as a percent of sales 
partially offsetting the gross profit decline  fiscal year income from continuing operations was positively impacted by lower new product introduction costs and million of after tax income relating to funds received as part of the polish offset credit program for investments made in the company s poland operation

the company also continues to focus on diversification of the electronic contract assemblies segment customer base 
the nature of the electronic manufacturing services industry is such that the start up of new customers and new programs to replace expiring programs occurs frequently 
new customer and program start ups generally cause losses early in the life of a program  which are generally recovered as the program matures and becomes established 
this segment continues to experience margin pressures related to an overall excess capacity position in the electronics subcontracting services market 
new business awards for projects in the automotive industry are extremely competitive 
risk factors within this segment include  but are not limited to  general economic and market conditions  increased globalization  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  rapid technological changes  component availability  the contract nature of this industry  and the importance of sales to large customers 
the continuing success of this segment is dependent upon its ability to replace expiring customers programs with new customers programs
