item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
on an on going basis  we evaluate these estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  capitalized software costs and goodwill 
we base these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements 
revenue recognition the company derives revenue from licensing its proprietary applications software and sub licensed software  sale of computer hardware and the services performed related to the installation  training  consultation and ongoing support of the software 
license fee revenue is generally recognized when evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
revenue from the sale of hardware is generally recognized upon shipment 
fees for installation  training and consultation are recognized as the services are provided 
if the company enters into arrangements with a client requiring significant customization of the software or services that are essential to the functionality of the software  the company recognizes revenue derived from the sale of licensed software  sub licensed software and services over the period the services are performed  in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  software revenue recognition as amended by sop no 
 sop and clarified by staff accounting bulletin sab  sab no 
and emerging issues task force support and maintenance fees  typically sold on an annual renewal basis  are recognized ratably over the period of the support contract 
capitalized software costs capitalized computer software costs consist of certain costs incurred to create and develop computer software products 
the company accounts for capitalized software costs in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed 
as such  the company capitalizes all software production costs incurred upon the establishment of technological feasibility for the product or enhancement  which ceases upon its general release 
technological feasibility occurs upon the completion of the planning  designing  coding and testing activities that are necessary to establish that the product or enhancement can be produced to meet its design specifications  including its functions  features and technical performance requirements 
the company amortizes capitalized software development costs for each product and enhancement over the estimated useful life of the product or enhancement  which ranges from to years 
these estimates are based on available information  including product life cycles  past history with similar products  the market and anticipated market share for the product and other factors unique to the product 
the company reports capitalized software costs at the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value 
net realizable value for capitalized software costs for each product or enhancement is determined by subtracting the estimated costs of completing and disposing of the product from the estimated future revenue of the product 
these estimates are based on available information  including product life cycles  past history and market for the products or enhancement  the market share the company expects to achieve  current and future pricing of the products  the existing customer base  and other factors unique to each product 
the evaluation of net realizable value is inherently very subjective 
however  the company believes its calculation of net realizable value has historically been accurate in all material respects 
due to the size of our customer base  which generates a recurring support revenue stream  combined with anticipated system sales from our new products  the company has not historically experienced  and does not anticipate  any significant changes to the net realizable value of our current capitalized software development costs 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to the net tangible assets of businesses acquired

accumulated amortization for goodwill was  at june  and goodwill was reduced by the recognition of related income tax benefit during fiscal and material changes in results of operations fiscal versus fiscal total revenue increased in fiscal compared to fiscal and the company s gross profit improved as well
