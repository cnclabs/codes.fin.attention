item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations year ended december  compared to december  the following discussion is intended to provide a more comprehensive review of the company s operating results and financial condition than can be obtained from reading the consolidated financial statements alone 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the notes thereto included later in this report 
all numbers  except per share data  are expressed in thousands of dollars 
highlights and overview during the past year the company acquired three banks and a branch that combined accounted for an increase in total assets of million  net loans of million  and deposits of million 
the acquisitions resulted in two new subsidiaries that are strategically located in southwest wyoming and southeast idaho and additional branches that merged into existing subsidiaries located in western montana and northern idaho 
the acquisitions resulted in additional goodwill of million and core deposit intangibles of million 
the company experienced strong loan growth with total loans outstanding increasing by million  or percent from the prior year 
without the acquisition  loans increased million  or percent 
all loan classifications experienced increases with commercial loan growth leading the way with an increase of million  or percent 
real estate loans increased million  or percent  and consumer loans increased by million  or percent 
due to the continuing reduction in spreads on funding costs versus investment returns  the cash flow from investments were used to fund loans 
investments declined million  or from prior year 
non interest bearing deposits increased million or percent during the year providing a stable low cost funding source for a portion of the asset growth 
the company also increased interest bearing deposits by million or percent  of which million was in the form of brokered cds 
million of the increase in other borrowed funds is from the treasury term auction borrowings that are a temporary funding source when the treasury has excess funds available 
the increase in deposits and other borrowed funds has allowed the company to reduce its funding with the federal home loan bank by million  which typically has a higher interest rate than other sources 
increases in short term interest rates by the federal reserve board during have resulted in higher yields on loans and sources of funding 
the increase in loan volumes  higher loan rates  and the increase in non interest bearing deposits  resulted in an increase in net interest income of million or percent over the prior year 
the company also increased non interest income by million primarily the result of the increase in the loan and deposit portfolios and the high volume of residential loans sold 
mortgage loans sold during increased million  or percent  which contributed to the million or percent increase on gain in sale of loans sold 
non interest expense increased million  or  from last year with the largest increase occurring in compensation and benefits 
additional locations and related staffing and merit increases were the primary reasons for this increase 
other operating expenses also increased reflecting the increased volume of activities in loan and deposit operations and the bank acquisitions 
looking forward  our future performance will depend on many factors including economic conditions  interest rate changes  increasing competition for deposits and quality loans  and regulatory burden 
increasing interest rates slow the volume of real estate loan originations which reduces the fee income from that activity while at the same time reducing commission expense for loan originators 
increasing rates result in increased earnings on assets  however  the cost of interest bearing funds also increases 
the company goal of asset and liability management practices is to maintain or increase the level of net interest income within an acceptable level of interest rate risk 
financial condition assets the results of operations and financial condition include the acquisitions from the completion dates forward

the company continues to focus on quality loan growth of all types which contributed to an increase in all loan categories 
liabilities the following table summarizes the liability balances as of december  and  the amount of change  and percentage change during december  liabilities in thousands change change non interest bearing deposits    interest bearing deposits    advances from federal home loan bank    securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other borrowed funds    other liabilities    subordinated debentures    total liabilities    non interest bearing deposits have increased million  or percent  since december  without acquisitions the increase was million  or percent 
this continues to be a primary focus of our banks and the programs we have initiated this past year continue to gain momentum 
interest bearing deposits  including million in broker originated certificates of deposit  have increased million from december  with million from acquisitions 
since december   without acquisitions  interest bearing deposits increased million  or percent 
this growth in deposits  a low cost stable funding source  gives us increased flexibility in managing our asset mix

the following table summarizes the major liability components as a percentage of total liabilities as of december    and december  liabilities and stockholder s equity deposit accounts fhlb advances other borrowings and repurchase agreements 
other liabilities stockholders equity the deposits increased from percent at december  to percent at december  the large increase in deposits and the increase in other borrowed funds allowed the company to significantly reduce the fhlb advances

fhlb dividends received were million lower in the increase in interest expense is primarily attributable to the volume increase in interest bearing liabilities  and increases in short term interest rates during and the net interest margin as a percentage of earning assets  on a tax equivalent basis  was percent which was five basis points higher than the percent result for non interest income total non interest income increased million  or percent in fee income increased million  or percent  over last year  driven primarily by an increased number of loan and deposit accounts  acquisitions  and additional customer product and services offered 
gain on sale of loans increased million  or percent  from last year 
loan origination activity for housing construction and purchases remains strong in our markets and has offset much of the reduction in refinance activity experienced last year

the efficiency ratio non interest expense net interest income non interest income increased slightly to percent up from percent for income tax expense income tax expense in was reduced by thousand due to the statutory closing of certain previous years tax returns and tax accrual adjustments 
credit quality information december  december  in thousands allowance for loan losses   non performing assets   allowance as a percentage of non performing assets non performing assets as a percentage of total assets allowance as a percentage of total loans net charge offs as a percentage of loans provision for loan losses non performing assets as a percentage of total assets at december  were at 
percent  increasing from 
percent at september  the result of higher levels of non performing assets acquired with the first state bank transaction 
without the effects of the first state bank acquisition  non performing assets would have been million  or 
percent of total assets 
at december  the ratio was 
percent 
the company ratios compare favorably to the federal reserve bank peer group average of 
percent at september   the most recent information available 
the allowance for loan losses was percent of non performing assets at december   up from percent a year ago 
the allowance  including million from acquisitions  has increased million  or percent  from a year ago 
the allowance of million  is percent of december  total loans outstanding  up slightly from the percent a year ago 
the provision for loan losses expense was million for  an increase of million  or percent  from net charge offs of thousand was a very low 
percent of loans outstanding which is substantially lower than the already low 
percent in with the continuing change in loan mix from residential real estate to commercial and consumer loans  which historically have greater credit risk  the company has increased the balance in the allowance for loan loss 
loan growth  average loan size  and credit quality considerations will determine the level of additional provision expense 
effect of inflation and changing prices generally accepted accounting principles require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars  without consideration for change in relative purchasing power over time due to inflation 
virtually all assets of a financial institution are monetary in nature  therefore  interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a company s performance than does the effect of inflation 
commitments in the normal course of business  there are various outstanding commitments to extend credit  such as letter of credit and un advanced loan commitments  which are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
management does not anticipate any material losses as a result of these transactions 
the company has outstanding debt maturities  the largest of which are the advances from the federal home loan bank 
for the maturity schedule of advances see footnote to the consolidated financial statements in item financial statements and supplementary data 
the following table represents our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period indeterminate dollars in thousands total maturity thereafter deposits        advances from the fhlb       repurchase agreements   subordinated debentures    capital lease obligations   operating lease obligations 
    represents interest and non interest bearing checking  money market  and savings accounts market risk market risk is the risk of loss in a financial instrument arising from adverse changes in market rates prices such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  and equity prices 
the company s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
the ongoing monitoring and management of this risk is an important component of the company s asset liability management process which is governed by policies established by its board of directors that are reviewed and approved annually 
the board of directors delegates responsibility for carrying out the asset liability management policies to the asset liability committee alco 
in this capacity alco develops guidelines and strategies impacting the company s asset liability management related activities based upon estimated market risk sensitivity  policy limits and overall market interest rate levels trends 
interest rate risk the objective of interest rate risk management is to contain the risks associated with interest rate fluctuations 
the process involves identification and management of the sensitivity of net interest income to changing interest rates 
managing interest rate risk is not an exact science 
the interval between repricing of interest rates of assets and liabilities changes from day to day as the assets and liabilities change 
for some assets and liabilities contractual maturity and the actual cash flows experienced are not the same 
a good example is residential mortgages that have long term contractual maturities but may be repaid well in advance of the maturity when current prevailing interest rates become lower than the contractual rate 
interest bearing deposits without a stated maturity could be withdrawn after seven days  however  the bank s experience indicates that these funding pools have a much longer duration and are not as sensitive to interest rate changes as other financial instruments 
prime based loans generally have rate changes when the federal reserve bank changes short term interest rates  however  depending on the magnitude of the rate change and the relationship of the current rates to rate floors and rate ceilings that may be in place on the loans  the loan rate may not change 
gap analysis the following table gives a description of our gap position for various time periods 
as of december   we had a negative gap position at six months and a positive gap position at twelve months 
the cumulative gap as a percentage of total assets for six months is a negative which compares to a negative at december  and a negative at december  the table also shows the gap earnings sensitivity  and earnings sensitivity ratio  along with a brief description as to how they are calculated 
the methodology used to compile this gap information is based on our mix of assets and liabilities and the historical experience accumulated regarding their rate sensitivity 
projected maturity or repricing more than dollars in thousands months months years years total assets interest bearing deposits and federal funds sold   investment securities      mortgage backed securities      fhlb stock and frb stock    floating rate loans      fixed rate loans      total interest bearing assets      liabilities interest bearing deposits      fhlb advances      repurchase agreements and other borrowed funds   total interest bearing liabilities      repricing gap      cumulative repricing gap     cumulative gap as a of total assets 
gap earnings sensitivity gap earnings sensitivity ratio gap earnings sensitivity is the estimated effect on income  after taxes of  of a increase or decrease in interest rates of  gap earnings sensitivity ratio is gap earnings sensitivity divided by the estimated yearly earnings of  a increase in interest rates has this estimated percentage decrease effect on annual income 
this table estimates the repricing maturities of the company s assets and liabilities  based upon the company s assessment of the repricing characteristics of the various instruments 
interest bearing checking and regular savings are included in the more than years category 
money market balances are included in the less than months category 
mortgage backed securities are at the anticipated principal payments based on the weighted average life 
net interest income simulation the traditional one dimensional view of gap is not sufficient to show a bank s ability to withstand interest rate changes 
because of limitations in gap modeling the asset liability management committee alco of the company uses a detailed and dynamic simulation model to quantify the estimated exposure of net interest income nii to sustained interest rate changes 
while alco routinely monitors simulated nii sensitivity over a rolling two year horizon  it also utilizes additional tools to monitor potential longer term interest rate risk 
the simulation model captures the impact of changing interest rates on the interest income received and interest expense paid on all assets and liabilities reflected on the company s statement of financial condition 
this sensitivity analysis is compared to alco policy limits which specify a maximum tolerance level for nii exposure over a one year horizon  assuming no balance sheet growth  given a basis point bp upward and or bp downward shift in interest rates 
a parallel and pro rata shift in rates over a month period is assumed as a benchmark 
other non parallel rate movement scenarios are also modeled to determine the potential impact on net interest income 
the following reflects the company s nii sensitivity analysis as of december  and as compared to the board approved policy limit 
bp estimated sensitivity estimated decrease in net interest income 
  bp and bp estimated sensitivity estimated increase in net interest income 
bp and bp for the years ended december   and  respectively the preceding sensitivity analysis does not represent a forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results 
these hypothetical estimates are based upon numerous assumptions including the nature and timing of interest rate levels including yield curve shape  prepayments on loans and securities  deposit decay rates  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  reinvestment replacement of assets and liability cash flows  and others 
while assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions  the company cannot make any assurances as to the predictive nature of these assumptions including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change 
also  as market conditions vary from those assumed in the sensitivity analysis  actual results will also differ due to prepayment refinancing levels likely deviating from those assumed  the varying impact of interest rate change caps or floors on adjustable rate assets  the potential effect of changing debt service levels on customers with adjustable rate loans  depositor early withdrawals and product preference changes  and other internal external variables 
furthermore  the sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions that alco might take in responding to or anticipating changes in interest rates 
liquidity risk liquidity risk is the possibility that the company will not be able to fund present and future obligations 
the objective of liquidity management is to maintain cash flows adequate to meet current and future needs for credit demand  deposit withdrawals  maturing liabilities and corporate operating expenses 
core deposits  fhlb credit lines  available for sale investment securities  and net income are the key elements in meeting these objectives 
all nine banking subsidiaries are members of the fhlb 
this membership provides for established lines of credit in the form of advances that are a supplemental source of funds for lending and other general business purposes 
as of year ended december   the company had million of available fhlb line of which million was utilized 
accordingly  management of the company has a wide range of versatility in managing the liquidity and asset liability mix for each individual institution as well as the company as a whole capital resources and adequacy maintaining capital strength has been a long term objective 
ample capital is necessary to sustain growth  provide protection against unanticipated declines in asset values  and to safeguard the funds of depositors 
capital also is a source of funds for loan demand and enables the company to effectively manage its assets and liabilities 
shareholders equity increased million during  or percent the net result of earnings of million  common stock issued for the acquisition of citizens and first state bank  less cash dividend payments and a decline of million in the net unrealized gains on available for sale investment securities

dividend payments were increased by 
per share  or percent in the payment of dividends is subject to government regulation  in that regulatory authorities may prohibit banks and bank holding companies from paying dividends which would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice 
critical accounting policies companies may apply certain critical accounting policies requiring management to make subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to estimate the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the company considers its only material critical accounting policy to be the allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses charged against earnings 
the balance of allowance for loan losses is maintained at the amount management believes will be adequate to absorb known and inherent losses in the loan portfolio 
the appropriate balance of allowance for loan losses is determined by applying estimated loss factors to the credit exposure from outstanding loans 
estimated loss factors are based on subjective measurements including management s assessment of the internal risk classifications  changes in the nature of the loan portfolio  industry concentrations and the impact of current local  regional and national economic factors on the quality of the loan portfolio 
changes in these estimates and assumptions are reasonably possible and may have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements  results of operations or liquidity 
for additional information regarding the allowance for loan losses  its relation to the provision for loans losses and risk related to asset quality  see note to the consolidated financial statements in item financial statements and supplementary data 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in november  the financial accounting standards board issued a staff position which amends sfas no 
accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
the staff position addresses the determination as to when an investment is considered impaired  whether that impairment is other than temporary  and the measurement of an impairment loss 
in may  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
accounting changes and errors corrections which requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
this statement replaces apb opinion no 
accounting changes  and sfas no 
reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
apb opinion no 
previously required that most voluntary changes in accounting principle be recognized by including in net income of the period of the change the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle 
this statement applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle 
it also applies to changes required by an accounting pronouncement in the unusual instance that the pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions 
the statement is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december in december  the financial accounting standards board issued a revised version of sfas no 
share based payment  mandating that companies measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award with limited exceptions 
the intrinsic value method of accounting for such awards  as previously elected by the company and provided for in apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees will no longer be acceptable under gaap for public companies as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june  if no comparable market values are available  the grant date fair value of employee share options and similar instruments is to be estimated using option pricing models adjusted for the unique characteristics of those instruments 
under the previous provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation companies using the intrinsic value method were required to disclose in a footnote to their financial statements the effect on net income of using the intrinsic value rather than the grant date fair value method 
the company has continued to use the intrinsic value method  with appropriate disclosures  in its financial statements through december  see stock based compensation under note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company expects to adopt sfas no

the investment portfolio generated approximately percent of the increase in interest income 
additional interest income from the large increase in loans outstanding was partially offset by lower rates on the loan portfolio due to refinancing  and re pricing of existing loans 
the increase in interest expense is attributed to the increase in the subordinated debentures which increased interest expense by million 
interest expense on deposits declined million  or percent  from reductions in rates on maturing fixed term interest bearing deposits 
interest on federal home loan bank borrowings and other borrowed funds increased million  or percent  from increased volumes and decreasing interest rates 
the net interest margin as a percentage of earning assets  on a tax equivalent basis  was percent which was a decrease from percent for non interest income fee income increased million  or percent  over last year  driven primarily by an increased number of loan and deposit accounts and the fee income associated with this growth in accounts 
gain on sale of loans decreased million  or percent  from last year  because of greatly reduced refinance activity 
loan origination activity for housing  especially new construction  remains quite strong in our markets

occupancy and equipment expense increased thousand  or percent  reflecting the cost of the additional locations and facility upgrades 
other expenses increased million  or percent  primarily from start up expenses on implementing the high performance checking program at the four banks not previously on the program  additional advertising expense  thousand increase in audit and consulting expenses  and costs associated with new branch offices and the acquisitions
