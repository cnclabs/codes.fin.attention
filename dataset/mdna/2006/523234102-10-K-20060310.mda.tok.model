we will continue to record compensation expense related to these restricted shares through august based upon continued employment of the individuals 
operations we derive our revenues primarily from professional service fees that are billed at hourly rates on a time and expense basis 
revenues related to these services are recognized when the earnings process is complete and collectibility is reasonably assured 
historically  we have also offered services related to large environmental claims for which our fee includes a significant performance based component 
due to the uncertainty regarding the amount and timing of performance based compensation  revenues from this service offering were recognized in the period when the earnings process was complete and payment was received for the services performed under the contract 
since january  performance based expert fees have ranged from to of our quarterly total revenues 
in  performance based expert fees comprised less than of our revenues compared to in our performance based fees will be substantially reduced in future periods as the result of the departure of the experts and staff comprising the insurance claims group in september revenues are comprised of fees for the services of our professional staff  fees for the services of our experts  performance based expert fees primarily relating to environmental claims  and amounts we charge for services provided by others and costs that are reimbursable by clients  including travel  document reproduction  subscription data services and other costs 
the following table summarizes our revenues from these sources by quarter from january  to december  in thousands mar  june  sept 
 dec  mar  june  sept 
 dec 
 expert and professional staff revenues performance based expert revenues reimbursable expenses revenues relates primarily to the insurance claims group  whose experts and certain staff departed in september compensation and project costs are comprised of salary  bonuses  taxes and benefits of all professional staff and salaried experts  compensation to experts based on a percentage of their individual professional fees  compensation to experts based on specified revenue and gross margin performance targets  fees earned by experts and other business generators as project origination fees  costs that are reimbursable by clients  including travel  document reproduction  subscription data services and other costs  and amortization of signing and performance bonuses that are subject to vesting over time 
hourly fees charged by the professional staff that supports our experts  rather than the hourly fees charged by our experts  generate a majority of our gross profit 
most of our experts are compensated based on a percentage of their billings from to  averaging approximately of their individual billings on particular projects in experts are paid when we have received payment from our clients 
any outstanding advances previously paid to experts are deducted from such payments 
in some cases  we have agreed to guarantee an expert s draw at the inception of their employment for a period of time  which is typically one year or less 
in such cases  if the expert s earnings do not exceed their draws within a reasonable period of time prior to the end of the guarantee period  we recognize an estimate of the compensation expense we will ultimately incur by the end of the guarantee period 
experts not currently on this compensation model are compensated on a salary plus performance based bonus model 
because of the manner in which we pay our experts  our gross profit is significantly dependent on the margin on our professional staff services 
the number of professional staff and the level of experience of professional staff assigned to a project will vary depending on the size  nature and duration of each engagement 
we manage our personnel costs by monitoring engagement requirements and utilization of the professional staff 
as an inducement to encourage experts to utilize our professional staff  experts generally receive project origination fees 
these fees are based primarily on a percentage of the collected professional staff fees 
project origination fees can also include a percentage of the collected expert fees for those experts acting in a support role on an engagement 
in  these fees have averaged of professional staff revenues 
experts are required  with some exceptions approved by us  to use our professional staff unless the skills required to perform the work are not available through us 
in these instances we engage outside individual or firm based consultants  who are typically compensated on an hourly basis 
both the revenue and the cost resulting from the services provided by these outside consultants are recognized in the period in which the services are performed 
such services are not a material component of our revenue 
hiring experts sometimes involves the payment of cash signing bonuses 
in some cases  the payment of a portion of a signing bonus is deferred until a future date 
signing bonuses are recognized when payment is made or we have the obligation to pay such bonus  and are generally amortized over the period during which they could be recovered from the employee if he or she were to leave us prior to a specified date  as defined in the employment agreement 
we have also paid or are obligated to pay performance bonuses to certain experts that are subject to the recovery of unearned amounts if the expert leaves prior to a specified date 
like signing bonuses  performance bonuses are amortized over the period that the bonus can be recovered  and we recognize the amortization of performance bonuses at the time we determine that it is considered more likely than not that the performance criteria will be met 
most of our agreements allow us to recover signing and performance bonuses over periods generally ranging from one to eight years 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition revenue includes all amounts earned that are billed or billable  including reimbursable expenses  and have been reduced for amounts related to work performed that are estimated to be uncollectible 
expert revenues consist of revenues generated by experts who are our employees and revenues generated by experts who are independent contractors 
there is no operating  business or other substantive distinction between our employee experts and our exclusive independent contractor experts 
revenues primarily arise from time and material contracts  which are recognized in the period the services are performed 
we also enter into certain performance based contracts for which performance fees are dependent upon a successful outcome  as defined by the consulting engagement 
revenues related to performance based fee contracts are recognized in the period when the earnings process is complete  and when we have received payment for the services we performed under the contract 
performance based fees have been generated primarily by the insurance claims group practice  the experts and staff of which left in september consequently  we expect that performance based revenues will be significantly reduced in future periods 
revenues are also generated from fixed price contracts  which are recognized as the agreed upon services are performed 
such fixed price contract revenues are not a material component of total revenues 
equity based compensation we will adopt sfas no 
r share based payment effective january  to account for equity based compensation 
under sfas no 
r  the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments is measured based on the grant date fair value of the award and is recognized over the service period defined by the terms of the award 
we have previously used the black scholes option pricing model for disclosure requirements under sfas no 
to estimate the fair value of options granted prior to adopting sfas no 
r  and will continue to use this model to value new option grants 
based on current options and restricted shares of common stock outstanding  we anticipate equity based compensation in will be approximately million 
the actual amount of equity based compensation to be incurred in can differ materially from this estimate based on factors such as the number of additional options and shares of restricted stock to be issued in  the volatility of our stock and the vesting period for equity instruments granted to employees 
provision for income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for income taxes  under which deferred assets and liabilities are recognized based upon anticipated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying values of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
in accordance with sfas no 
 a valuation allowance is established to reduce the carrying value of deferred tax assets if it is considered more likely than not that such asset will not be realized 
significant management judgment is required in determining if it is more likely than not that we will be able to utilize the potential tax benefit represented by our deferred tax assets 
consideration is given to evidence such as the history of prior year taxable income  expiration periods for net operating losses and our projections 
no valuation allowance was recorded at december  or on deferred tax assets arising from our operations in the united states 
as of december   we had  of deferred tax assets in connection with foreign net operating losses of approximately million for which the company has provided a full valuation allowance due to the uncertainty that these net operating loss carryforwards will eventually be utilized 
we are entitled to a deduction for federal and state income taxes when non qualified stock options are exercised and stock purchased through our employee stock purchase plan  or espp  is sold prior to the end of a required holding period 
in and  we recognized a total benefit from option exercises and disqualifying dispositions from our espp of million and million  respectively which reduced deferred tax assets and increased stockholders equity 
our effective tax rate used to provide for estimated quarterly tax expense is determined based on estimates of worldwide pre tax income  permanent differences and credits  and reviewed quarterly to determine if actual results require modifying the effective tax rate 
our actual effective tax rate for and was 
from september  to november   we operated as a limited liability company llc and were taxed as a partnership 
accordingly  lecg paid no significant income taxes on its own behalf during that period and there is no provision for income tax during the periods from september  to november  in our consolidated financial statements 
in connection with our november initial public offering  we became a c corporation subject to federal and state income taxes 
our results for the quarter and year ended december  include an income tax benefit of million 
as a result of our conversion from a nontaxable limited liability company to a taxable c corporation as of our november  initial public offering  and in accordance with sfas no 
 we established beginning balances in our deferred tax assets and liabilities 
our net deferred tax assets were comprised primarily of certain expert fees and equity based compensation amounts that were previously expensed for financial reporting purposes  but were not yet deducted for income tax purposes 
such amounts were required to be recognized through the income tax provision in the period of the change in our tax status 
based upon our results  and our estimates of and future results  we determined that it was more likely than not  that we would realize the benefit of these deferred tax assets and  accordingly  no valuation allowance was considered necessary 
goodwill and identifiable intangibles goodwill was recorded at the time of the management buyout in september additional goodwill and identifiable intangible were recorded related to acquisitions made through december  we determined that we have one reporting unit based on several factors  one of which was the similarity of operations throughout our individual offices 
we evaluate our acquisitions on an individual basis to determine if it represents a separate reporting unit  as defined by sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  for purposes of assigning goodwill and performing subsequent impairment testing 
thus far  our business acquisitions have been integrated within the structure of our organization and our individual offices share similar economic characteristics and consequently are aggregated for purposes of identifying our reporting units 
we assess the impairment of goodwill at least annually  and whenever events or significant changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors that we consider important in determining whether to perform an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to forecasted operating results and significant negative industry or economic trends 
if we determine that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable  then we will assess impairment based on a projection of undiscounted future cash flows or some other basis such as our quoted market price and measure the amount of impairment based on fair value 
if a portion of a reporting unit that constitutes a business as defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states has been disposed of by sale or abandonment  goodwill associated with that business is included in the carrying amount of that business in determining the gain or loss on disposal 
during the third quarter of  we wrote off million of goodwill associated with the departure in september of certain experts and staff comprising the insurance claims group  who joined us in july in connection with an acquisition 
for the annual goodwill impairment test  we used the quoted market price of our common stock and compared our fair value to the carrying value of our equity 
at october   we concluded that there was no impairment to our goodwill 
intangible assets that are separable from goodwill and have determinable useful lives are valued separately and amortized over their expected useful lives 
intangible assets consist principally of customer related intangibles  including customer relationships and contract rights  as well as non compete agreements and trade processes  and are amortized over six months to years 
we assess the impairment of intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
if we determine that the carrying value of an intangible asset may not be recoverable  then we will assess impairment based on a projection of undiscounted future cash flows 
at december  and  we concluded that there was no impairment in our intangible assets 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our financial statements contain various estimates including  but not limited to  estimates for unrealizable revenue  estimates for advances considered unrecoverable from experts on the expert model  valuation allowance on deferred tax assets  discretionary and performance based bonuses and contingent payments for businesses acquired 
actual results could differ from those estimates

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk cash investment policy we have established cash investment guidelines consistent with the objectives of preservation and safety of funds invested  ensuring liquidity and optimizing yield on investment 
eligible investments include money market accounts  us treasuries  us agency securities  commercial paper  municipal bonds  aaa rated asset backed securities  certificates of deposit and agency backed mortgage securities 
we seek the highest quality credit rating available for each type of security used for investment purposes 
interest rate risk our interest income and expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates in the united states  particularly since the majority of our investments are short term in nature 
due to the nature of our short term investments  we have concluded that we do not have material market risk exposure 
our investment policy requires us to invest funds in excess of current operating requirements 
as of december   our cash and cash equivalents consisted primarily of money market funds 
the recorded carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents approximate fair value due to their short maturities 
our long term debt agreement calls for interest to be charged at variable rates 
we had no outstanding long term debt during if the weighted average interest rate on our variable rate debt were to have changed by basis points in  interest expense would not have been different from that reported 
currency risk we currently have international operations in argentina  belgium  canada  france  italy  new zealand  south korea  spain and the united kingdom 
the functional currency in each location is the local currency 
fluctuations in exchange rates of the us dollar against foreign currencies may result in foreign exchange gains and losses 
if exchange rates on such currencies were to fluctuate  we believe that our results from operations and cash flows would not be materially affected
