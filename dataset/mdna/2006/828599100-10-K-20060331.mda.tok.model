item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
quality and process control all of our manufacturing locations are certified under the iso quality assurance designation 
these quality assurance designations are only provided to those manufacturers which exhibit stringent quality and process control assurances after extensive evaluation and auditing by these independent quality assurance organizations 
quality control is essential to the company s operations since customers demand strict compliance with design and product specifications  and high quality production is a primary competitive standard vital to our services 

back to table of contents 
index to financial statements product components  assemblies and sub assemblies manufactured by the company are thoroughly inspected visually and electronically to ensure all components are made to strict specifications and are functional and safe 
strict process controls relating to the entire manufacturing process are part of our standard operating procedure 
over the years  our product and manufacturing quality have received excellent ratings 
total quality  timely delivery and customer satisfaction is our philosophy 
high levels of quality in every area of our operations are essential 
quality standards are established for each operation  performance tracked against those standards  and identifying workflow and implementing necessary changes to deliver higher quality levels 
we maintain regular contact with our customers to ensure adequate information exchange and other activities necessary to ensure customer satisfaction and to support our high level of quality and on time delivery 
any adverse change in our quality and process controls could adversely affect our relationships with customers and ultimately our revenues and profitability 
customers we serve a wide range of businesses  from emerging growth companies to multinational oems  involved in a variety of markets including computer networking systems  computer workstations  telecommunications  mass data storage systems  instrumentation and food preparation equipment industries 
a significant portion of our revenues is distributed over the following industry segments year ended december  data processing food preparation equipment instrumentation power equipment telecommunications military and government we seek to serve a sufficiently large number of customers to avoid dependence on any one customer or industry 
though historically a substantial percentage of our net sales have been to multiple locations of a small number of customers  our customer base has become increasingly diversified over the past four years 
in thirteen customers made up of our sales with our largest customer accounting for of total revenues 
in the successive years of   and we have grown our customer base to   and customers who make up of our sales and our largest customer contributing of the revenue base 
significant reductions or delays in sales to any of those major customers would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in the past  certain of our customers have terminated their manufacturing relationship with us  or significantly reduced their product orders 
we cannot assure you that any of our major customers will not terminate or significantly reduce or delay manufacturing orders  any of which such terminations or changes in manufacturing orders could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we depend upon the continued growth  viability and financial stability of our customers  who in turn substantially depend on the growth of the personal computer  computer peripherals  communications  instrumentation  data processing and food preparation equipment industries 
most of these industries have been characterized by rapid technological change  short product life cycles  pricing and margin pressures 
in addition  many of our customers in these industries are affected by general economic conditions 
the factors affecting these industries in general  and or our customers in particular  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in addition  we generate significant accounts receivable in connection with providing manufacturing services to our customers 
if one or more of our customers were to become insolvent or otherwise were unable to pay us for manufacturing services we have provided  our operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected 
in  of our sales were made to numerous locations of five major customers

index to financial statements the table below sets forth the respective percentage of sales in the last three years attributable to customers and related suppliers that accounted for more than of our sales in each of those years 
itw food equipment group marketing and sales we are continually pursuing expansion and diversification of our customer base 
we are seeking to develop long term relationships by working closely with customers  starting with the initial product design and development stage  and continuing throughout the manufacturing and distribution process 
our principal sources of new business are the expansion in the volume and scope of services provided to existing customers  referrals from customers and suppliers  direct sales through our sales managers and executive staff  and through independent sales representatives 
our operations generate sales through eight regional sales general managers covering the northeast  southeast  west and southwest regions of the united states  as well as parts of mexico 
there are in house sales marketing personnel in the united states 
in addition to sales through sales representatives and in house sales personnel  sales are also generated through our website at http www 
simclar 
com and through catalogues  brochures and trade shows 
the independent manufacturer sales representatives  primarily marketing electronic and similar high technology products  are retained under exclusive sales representative agreements for specific territories and are paid on a commission basis 
unless otherwise approved by simclar  the sales representatives cannot represent any other person engaged in the business of manufacturing services similar to those of the company  nor represent any person who may be in competition with us 
the agreements further prohibit the sales representative from disclosing trade secrets or calling on our customers for a period of six months to one year from termination of their agreement 
substantially all of our sales and reorders are affected through competitive bidding 
most sales are accomplished through purchase orders with specific quantity  price and delivery terms 
some production  such as for our kanban and pull programs  is accomplished under open purchase orders with components released against customer request 
backlog order backlogs as of december  were approximately  compared to  at december  based on past experience and relationships with our customers and knowledge of our manufacturing capabilities  we believe that most of our backlog orders are firm and should be filled within six months 
most of the purchase orders within which the company performs do not provide for cancellation 
over the last several years  cancellations have been minimal and management does not believe that any significant amount of the backlog orders will be cancelled 
however  based upon relationships with our customers  we occasionally allow cancellations and frequently the rescheduling of deliveries 
the variations in the size and delivery schedules of purchase orders received by the company may result in substantial fluctuations in backlog from period to period 
since orders and commitments may be rescheduled or cancelled  and customers lead times may vary  backlog does not necessarily reflect the timing or amount of future sales

index to financial statements patents and trademarks we do not have nor do we rely on patents or trademarks to establish or protect our market position 
rather  we depend on design  engineering and manufacturing  cost containment  quality  and marketing skills to establish or maintain market position 
seasonality our business is not seasonal 
competition simclar is a part of highly competitive electronic manufacturing services industry 
we face competition from divisions of large electronics and high technology firms  as well as numerous smaller specialized companies 
certain competitors may have broader geographic coverage and competitive price advantage based on their less expensive offshore operations  particularly in the far east 
many of our competitors are larger and more geographically diverse and have greater financial  manufacturing and marketing resources than we have 
our main pcb competitors in the midwest region include smc  diversified systems  epic technologies  and cdr manufacturing 
the primary competitors for our mexico pcb operations include kimball electronics  method electronics  and jabil 
we have numerous competitors in the cable and harness assembly market  including tyco  advanced interconnect  amphenol  sapphire  volex interconnect systems  and foxconn 
we believe that we are favorably positioned with regard to primary competitive factors price  quality of production  manufacturing capability  prompt customer service  timely delivery  engineering expertise  and technical support 
we also believe that our affiliation with simclar group enhances our competitive position internationally 
however  recent consolidation trends in the electronic manufacturing services industry are resulting in changes in the competitive landscape 
increased competition could result in lower priced components and lower profit margins  or loss of customers  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
compared to manufacturers who have greater direct buying power with component suppliers or who have lower cost structures  we may be operating at a cost disadvantage 
due to the number and variety of competitors  reliable data reflective to our competitive position in the electronic components and assembly industry is difficult to develop and is not known 
research and development we spend limited amounts on research and development efforts 
our products are generally manufactured to customer specifications 
governmental regulation our operations are subject to certain federal  state and local regulatory requirements relating to environmental waste management and health and safety matters 
we believe that we comply with applicable regulations pertaining to health  safety and the use  storage and disposal of materials that are considered hazardous waste under applicable law 
to date  our costs for compliance and governmental permits and authorizations have not been material 
however  additional or modified requirements that may require substantial additional expenditures may be imposed in the future

item a 
risk factors this report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ significantly from the prospects discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those listed below 
the loss of a major customer would adversely affect us a substantial percentage  approximately of our sales for the year ended december   has been to five customers  the loss of any of which would adversely affect us 
a substantial portion of our sales is with one major customer  illinois tool works formerly pmi foods equipment group itw 
there are no long term contracts with any customer 
substantially all of our sales and reorders are subject to competitive bids 
sales are dependent on the success of our customers  some of which operate in businesses associated with rapid technological change  vigorous competition  short product life cycles  and pricing and margin pressures 
additionally  certain of the industries served by us are subject to economic cycles and have in the past experienced  and are likely in the future to experience  recessionary periods 
developments adverse to our major customers or their products could have an adverse effect on us 
a variety of conditions  both specific to each individual customer and generally affecting each customer s industry  may cause customers to cancel  reduce or delay purchase orders and commitments without penalty  except for payment for services rendered  materials purchased and  in certain circumstances  charges associated with such cancellation  reduction or delay 
in addition  we generate large accounts receivable in connection with our providing of electronic contract manufacturing 
if one or more of our customers experiences financial difficulty and is unable to pay for the services provided by us  our operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected 
we expect to continue to depend on sales to a limited number of major customers 
secured loans existence of liens on certain assets all of our assets have been pledged as collateral for three bank loans 
in december  we entered into two amended credit facilities and one new credit facility with bank of scotland in edinburgh  scotland bos 
these credit facilities include an amended term loan facility letter  an amended working capital facility letter  a working capital facility letter  an amended and restated general security agreement  an amended and restated pledge agreement  and a mortgage and a guaranty 
please refer to the liquidity and capital resources section under item for further discussion regarding these credit facilities 
our credit facilities impose operational and financial restrictions on us our credit facilities with bos   in addition to subjecting all our assets as security for the bank financing  include substantial covenants that impose significant restrictions 
please refer to the liquidity and capital resources section under item for a further description of these restrictions 

back to table of contents 
index to financial statements our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by changes in our financial condition or results of our operations  or other events beyond our control 
the breach of any of the covenants would result in a default under our debt facilities 
a default in the covenants would permit bos to accelerate the maturity of our credit facilities and to sell the assets securing them  which could cause us to cease operations or seek bankruptcy protection 
our indebtedness requires us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt  which could reduce amounts available for working capital and other general corporate purposes 
the restrictions in our credit facility could also limit our flexibility in reacting to changes in our business and increases our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions 
we operate in a highly competitive industry and our business may be harmed by competitive pressures manufacturing and assembly of electro mechanical and electronic components is a highly competitive industry characterized by a diversity and sophistication of products and components 
we compete with major electronics firms that have substantially greater financial and technical resources and personnel than we do 
we also face competition from many smaller  more specialized companies 
we believe the primary competitive factors are pricing  quality of production  prompt customer service  timely delivery  engineering expertise  and technical assistance to customers 
among this mix of competitive standards  we believe we are competitive with respect to delivery time  quality  price and customer service 
price sensitivity becomes a paramount competitive issue in recessionary periods  and we may be at a competitive disadvantage with manufacturers with a lower cost structure  particularly off shore manufacturers with lower labor and related production costs 
to compete effectively  we must also provide technologically advanced manufacturing services  and respond flexibly and rapidly to customers design and schedule changes 
our inability to do so could have adverse effects on us 
customers in our industry are price sensitive and  particularly in the recent economic downturn  there is substantial pressure from customers to reduce our prices 
our ability to remain competitive depends on our ability to meet these customer and competitive price pressures while protecting our profit margins 
we have been engaged in and will have to continue cost reductions in overhead  manufacturing processes  and equipment retooling  while maintaining product flow  inventory control  and just in time shipping to our customers 
if we are unable to accomplish these factors  we will not be competitive  and our business and operating results will be adversely impacted 
our revenues are contingent on the health of the industries we serve we rely on the continued growth and financial stability of our customers who operate in the following industry segments food preparation equipment  data processing  telecommunications  power equipment  instrumentation  and military and government 
these industry segments  to a varying extent  are subject to dynamic changes in technology  competition  short product life cycles  and economic recessionary periods 
when our customers are adversely affected by these factors  we may be similarly affected 

back to table of contents 
index to financial statements manufacture of electronic and electro mechanical products  particularly designed for oems and manufactured to custom specifications  is cyclical  and demand for our products may decline our business depends substantially on both the volume of electronic and electro mechanical production by oems in the data processing  telecommunications  instrumentation and food preparation industries  and new specifications and designs for these oems 
these industries have been cyclical over the years  and have experienced oversupply as well as significantly reduced demand  as we have experienced in recent years 
an economic downturn can result in lower capacity utilization of our manufacturing operations and a shift in product mix toward lower margin assemblies 
changes in economic conditions and demand can result in customer rescheduling of orders and shipments  which affect our results of operations 
moreover  our need to invest in engineering  marketing  and customer services and support capabilities will limit our ability to reduce expenses  as we would attempt to do  in response to such downturns 
we do not have long term contracts with customers  and cancellations  reductions or delays in orders affect our profitability we do not typically obtain firm long term contracts from our customers 
instead  we work closely with our customers to develop forecasts for upcoming orders  which are not binding  in order to properly schedule inventory and manufacturing 
our customers may alter or cancel their orders or demand delays in production for a number of reasons beyond our control  which may include market demand for products  change in inventory control and procedures  acquisitions of or consolidations among competing customers  electronic design and technological advancements  and recessionary economic environment 
any one of these factors may significantly change the total volume of sales and affect our operating results  in times of a recessionary environment and reduced demand for our customers products and in turn  our products and services 
in addition  since much of our costs and operating expenses are relatively fixed  a reduction in customer demand would adversely affect our gross margins and operating income 
although we are always seeking new business and customers  we cannot be assured that we will be able to replace deferred  reduced or cancelled orders 
shortages of components as well as price fluctuations specified by our customers would delay shipments and adversely affect our profitability substantially all of our sales are derived from electro mechanical and subcontract electronic manufacturing in which we purchase components specified by our customers 
industry wide shortages of electronic components  particularly components for pcb assemblies  have occurred 
we did not experience any substantial supply shortages in  but experienced some shortages in and  which may increase as the world economy continues to recover and demand for electronic products increases 
should our industry experience a rapid recovery  shortages of components mostly likely will occur  and we may be forced to delay shipments  which could have an adverse effect on our profit margins and customer relations 
because of the continued increase in demand for surface mount components  we anticipate component shortages and longer lead times for certain components to occur from time to time 
also  we typically bear the risk of component price increases that occur  which accordingly could adversely affect our gross profit margins 
as price increase pressures continue we are beginning to pass these increases on as competition allows 
at times  we are forced to purchase components beyond customer demand on items which are in short supply 
to the extent there is less customer demand or cancellations  we could have increased obsolescence 

back to table of contents 
index to financial statements technological developments  satisfying customer designs and production requirements  quality and process controls are factors impacting our operations our existing and future operations are and will be influenced by several factors  including technological developments  our ability to efficiently meet the design and production requirements of our customers  our ability to control costs  our ability to evaluate new orders to target satisfactory profit margins  and our capacity to develop and manage the introduction of new products 
we also may not be able to adequately identify new product trends or opportunities  or respond effectively to new technological changes 
quality control is also essential to our operations  since customers demand strict compliance with design and product specifications 
any deviation from our quality and process controls would adversely affect our relationship with customers  and ultimately our revenues and profitability 
our operating results are subject to annual and quarterly fluctuation which could negatively impact our stock price there are a number of factors  beyond our control  that may affect our annual and quarterly results 
these factors include the volume and timing of customer orders  changes in labor and operating prices  fluctuations in material cost and availability  changes in domestic and international economies  timing of our expenditures in anticipation of future orders  increase in price competition  and competitive pressures on delivery time and product reliability  changes in demand for customer products  the efficiency and effectiveness of our automated manufacturing processes  market acceptance of new products introduced by our customers  and uneven seasonal demands by our customers 
any one or a combination of these factors can cause an adverse effect on our future annual and quarterly financial results 
fluctuations in our operating results could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
environmental laws may expose us to financial liability and restrictions on operations we are subject to a variety of federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental  waste management  and health and safety concerns  including the handling  storage  discharge and disposal of hazardous materials used in or derived from our manufacturing processes 
proper waste disposal is a major consideration for printed circuit board manufacturers  which is a substantial part of our business  since metals and chemicals are used in our manufacturing process 
environmental controls are also essential in our other areas of electronic assembly 
if we fail to comply with such environmental laws and regulations  then we could incur liabilities and fines and our operations could be suspended 
this could also trigger indemnification of our lender under our credit facilities  as well as being deemed a default under such credit facilities 
see our credit facilities impose operational and financial restrictions on us above 
such laws and regulations could also restrict our ability to modify or expand our facilities  could require us to acquire costly equipment  or could impose other significant capital expenditures 
in addition  our operations may give rise to claims of property contamination or human exposure to hazardous chemicals or conditions 
although we have not incurred any environmental problems in our operations  there can be no assurance that violations of environmental laws will not occur in the future due to failure to obtain permits  human error  equipment failure  or other causes 
furthermore  environmental laws may become more stringent and impose greater compliance costs and increase risks and penalties for violations

index to financial statements simclar group controls over of our common stock and the affairs of our company simclar group owns of our outstanding common stock 
our common stock does not provide for cumulative voting  and therefore  the shareholders other than simclar group will be unable to elect any directors or have any significant impact in controlling the business or affairs of our company 
the concentration of ownership with simclar group may also have the effect of delaying  deterring or preventing a change in control of our company  and would make transactions relating to our operations more difficult or impossible without the support of simclar group 
also  since we are a controlled company for purposes of the nasdaq stock market s corporate governance requirements  we are not required to comply with the provisions requiring that a majority of listed company directors be independent  the compensation of our executives to be determined by independent directors or nominees for election to our board of directors to be selected by independent directors 
the price of our shares is volatile the market price of our common stock has substantially fluctuated in the past 
the market price of our common stock has been as high as per share in the second quarter of to as low as 
per share in the fourth quarter of our common stock has limited trading volume  and it closed at per share on march  there are a variety of factors which contribute to the volatility of our common stock 
these factors include domestic and international economic conditions  stock market volatility  our reported financial results  fluctuations in annual and quarterly operating results  and general conditions in the contract manufacturing and technology sectors 
announcements concerning our company and competitors  our operating results  and any significant amount of shares eligible for future sale may also have an impact on the market price of our common stock 
as a result of these factors  the volatility of our common stock prices may continue in the future 
we have not declared dividends  and our credit facilities prohibit us from paying dividends without written consent from our lender under florida corporate law  holders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends from legally available funds  when and if declared by our board of directors 
we have not paid any cash dividends  and our board of directors does not intend to declare dividends in the foreseeable future 
our future earnings  if any  will be used to finance our capital requirements  repay bank borrowings and fund our operations 
our credit facilities prohibit us from paying any dividends without the written consent of the lender or making any other payments on our capital stock without the written consent of the lender 
there can be no assurance that the lender will provide such consent 
possible delisting of our stock our common stock trades on the nasdaq capital market 
there are certain qualitative and quantitative criteria for continued listing on the nasdaq capital market  known as continued listing requirements 
failure to satisfy any one of these continued listing requirements could result in our securities being delisted from the nasdaq capital market 
these criteria include at least two active market makers  maintenance of  of stockholders equity or alternatively   in market capitalization or  in net income from operations in the latest fiscal year or of the last fiscal years  a minimum bid price for our common stock of  and at least  publicly held shares with a market value of at least  among others 
continued listing also requires compliance with the nasdaq stock market s corporate governance listing criteria 
usually  if a deficiency occurs for a period of consecutive trading days consecutive trading days for failure to satisfy the minimum market capitalization requirement  the particular company is notified by nasdaq and has a grace period in which to achieve compliance 
if the company is unable to demonstrate compliance after the expiration of any applicable grace period  the security is subject to delisting 
the security might be able to trade on the nasdaq otc bulletin board  a less transparent trading market which may not provide the same visibility for the company or liquidity for its securities  as does the nasdaq capital market 
as a consequence  an investor may find it more difficult to dispose of or obtain prompt quotations as to the price of our securities  and may be exposed to a risk of decline in the market price of our common stock 

back to table of contents 
index to financial statements the nasdaq capital market requires that we maintain a minimum market value of public float of  for continued listing 
the publicly trading shares  exclusive of any affiliate ownership  which is the float for our common stock  is approximately  shares  and as the closing price of our shares on march  was per share  we currently satisfy that maintenance requirement 
our common stock has limited trading volume 
there is the risk of being delisted from the nasdaq capital market should our common stock fail to maintain a minimum bid price of per share for consecutive days  or we fail to meet other continued listing requirements 
during we were notified by nasdaq of a failure to meet its qualitative listing requirements due to the failure of our audit committee to comply with the independence criteria  although the company was able to correct this deficiency before further action by nasdaq 
continued satisfaction of certain of the nasdaq capital market continued listing requirements is beyond our control 
there is no assurance that we will continue to satisfy the continued listing maintenance criteria  which  without a timely cure  could cause our securities to be delisted from the nasdaq capital market 
a significant downturn in the general economy could adversely affect our revenue  gross margin and earning 
our business is subject to inflation  rising interest rates  availability of capital markets  consumer spending rates  the effects of governmental plans to manage economic conditions and other national and global economic occurrences beyond our control which could have an adverse affect on our revenue  gross margin and earnings 
as suppliers to the oem market many of our products  and hence our revenue and gross margin  is strongly correlated with general economic conditions and with the level of business activity of our customers 
economic weakness and constrained customer spending has resulted in the past  and may result in the future  in decreased revenue  gross margin  earnings  or growth rates 
we also have experienced  and may experience in the future  gross margin declines reflecting the effects of increased pressure for price concessions as our customers attempt to lower their cost structures and increased material costs as our suppliers attempt to increase their prices 
in this environment  we may not be able to reduce our costs sufficiently to maintain our margins 
failure to attract and retain qualified personnel may result in difficulties in managing our business effectively and meeting revenue growth objective 
our ability to profitably manage and grow our business depends upon the contributions and abilities of key executives  operating officers and other personnel 
the loss of the services of any of these key employees could have a material impact on the company s business and results of operations 
in addition  continued growth and expansion of the company s contract manufacturing business in an extremely competitive market will require that it attract  motivate and retain additional skilled and experienced personnel 
the inability to satisfy these requirements could have a negative impact on the company s ability to remain competitive in the future 
there are inherent limitations in all control systems  and misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected 
simclar s management  including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer  does not expect that any company s controls  including our own  will prevent all error and all fraud 
a control system  no matter how well designed and operated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance that the objectives of the control system are met 
the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefit of controls must be evaluated in relation to their costs 
because of the inherent limitations in all control systems  no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud  if any  in the company have been detected 
these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake 
further  controls can be circumvented by individual acts of some persons  by collusion of two or more persons  or by management override of the controls 
the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events  and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions 
over time  a control may be inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 
because of inherent limitations in a cost effective control system  misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected

index to financial statements our operations have continued to depend upon a relatively small number of customers for a significant percentage of our net revenue 
significant reductions in sales to any of our large customers would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
the level and timing of orders placed by a customer vary due to the customer s attempts to balance its inventory  design modifications  changes in a customer s manufacturing strategy  acquisitions of or consolidations among customers  and variation in demand for a customer s products due to  among other things  product life cycles  competitive conditions and general economic conditions 
termination of manufacturing relationships or changes  reductions or delays in orders could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition  as has occurred in the past 
our results also depend to a substantial extent on the success of our oem customers in marketing their products 
we continue to seek to diversify our customer base to reduce our reliance on our few major customers 
see business strategy and customers under item  business 
the industry segments we serve  and the electronics industry as a whole  are subject to rapid technological change and product obsolescence 
discontinuance or modification of products containing components manufactured by our company could adversely affect our results of operations 
the electronics industry is also subject to economic cycles and has in the past experienced  and is likely in the future to experience  recessionary periods 
a prolonged worldwide recession in the electronics industry  as we experienced from through  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
during periods of recession in the electronics industry  our competitive advantages in the areas of quick turnaround manufacturing and responsive customer service may be of reduced importance to electronic oems  who may become more price sensitive 
we typically do not obtain long term volume purchase contracts from our customers  but rather we work with our customers to anticipate future volumes of orders 
based upon such anticipated future orders  we will make commitments regarding the level of business we want and can accomplish given the current timing of production schedules and the levels of and utilization of facilities and personnel 
occasionally  we purchase raw materials without a customer order or commitment 
customers may cancel  delay or reduce orders  usually without penalty  for a variety of reasons  whether relating to the customer or the industry in general  which orders are already made or anticipated 
any significant cancellations  reductions or order delays could adversely affect our results of operations 
we use electronic data interchange edi with both our customers and our suppliers in our efforts to continuously develop accurate forecasts of customer volume requirements  as well as sharing our future requirements with our suppliers 
we depend on the timely availability of many components 
component shortages could result in manufacturing and shipping delays or increased component prices  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
it is important for us to efficiently manage inventory  proper timing of expenditures and allocations of physical and personnel resources in anticipation of future sales  the evaluation of economic conditions in the electronics industry and the mix of products  whether pcbs  wire harnesses  cables  or turnkey products  for manufacture

we must continuously develop improved manufacturing procedures to accommodate our customers needs for increasingly complex products 
to continue to grow and be a successful competitor  we must be able to maintain and enhance our technological capabilities  develop and market manufacturing services which meet changing customer needs and successfully anticipate or respond to technological changes in manufacturing processes on a cost effective and timely basis 
although we believe that our operations utilize the assembly and testing technologies and equipment currently required by our customers  there can be no assurance that our process development efforts will be successful or that the emergence of new technologies  industry standards or customer requirements will not render our technology  equipment or processes obsolete or noncompetitive 
in addition  to the extent that we determine that new assembly and testing technologies and equipment are required to remain competitive  the acquisition and implementation of such technologies and equipment are likely to require significant capital investment

index to financial statements our results of operations are also affected by other factors  including price competition  the level and timing of customer orders  fluctuations in material costs due to availability  the overhead efficiencies achieved by management in managing the costs of our operations  our experience in manufacturing a particular product  the timing of expenditures in anticipation of increased orders  selling  and general and administrative expenses 
accordingly  gross margins and operating income margins have generally improved during periods of high volume and high capacity utilization 
we generally have idle capacity and reduced operating margins during periods of lower volume production 
key financial performance measures we manage and assess the performance of our business primarily through the following measures orders booked and backlog the ratio of orders booked to sales is reviewed on a monthly basis for each of the company s five manufacturing plants 
sales monthly sales for each plant are compared against budget and the same month in the previous year 
gross margin the gross margin achieved by each plant each month is compared against budget and the same month in the previous year 
selling  general and administrative expenses the ratio of these expenses as a percentage of sales for each plant each month is compared against budget 
working capital movements in the balance sheet amounts of inventory  accounts receivable and accounts payable for each plant are reviewed on a monthly basis 
bank borrowings movements in the company s working capital facility with the bank are reviewed on a weekly basis 
in the event that any of the above measures indicate unusual movements or trends  further review is undertaken by management to ensure that satisfactory explanations are obtained  and  where necessary  appropriate corrective action is taken 
results of operations the following is a discussion of the key factors that have affected our business over the last three years

these products are more labor intensive than our other products which allowed us to benefit from our investment in the expanded operations in mexico 
snai generated approximately  of revenues since the date of acquisition  but lost approximately  we expect the performance of this operation  which does metal fabrication  injection molding  and higher level assemblies  to improve in as a result of certain ongoing initiatives  together with the synergistic benefits from our recent acquisition of the litton interconnect technologies backplane assembly business 
even though a large portion of revenues continue to be concentrated with a small number of customers of our sales were made to numerous locations of five major customers our customer base has become increasingly diversified over the past four years 
in thirteen customers made up of our sales  with our largest customer accounting for of total revenues

gross margin for was up by approximately  but was down as a percentage of revenue to from for  however  excluding the snai results  gross margins would have been in the year 
excluding snai  which has a higher labor and overhead to materials ratio than other simclar operations  material costs as a percentage of sales were in both and raw material cost pressures are a constant challenge because  while we try to pass these costs on to our customers  price competition will at times limit our ability to do so 
labor and burden were of sales in  down slightly from for due to the expansion in mexico and acquisition of snai  depreciation expense was  greater than the previous year while amortization expense was  for and for selling  general  and administrative sg a expenses grew from of sales in to in the primary reason for this increased cost was due to expansion of the mexico operations and the acquisition of snai 
as a percentage of sales  sg a was of sales in the first half of the year  but came down to the second half 
interest expense increased due to higher interest rates and borrowings for the mexico expansion and the working capital needs caused by the overall growth in the business in the year 
interest for was approximately  compared to approximately  in the prior year 
three month libor went from in january to in december compared to consolidated revenues increased approximately  for the year ended december   compared to the preceding year 
the acquisition of simclar mexico in july generated  of the increase in sales in continual improvements in our sales to the computer peripherals  instrumentation  power equipment  telecommunications and food preparation equipment industries provided the additional  of increased sales in  compared to the preceding year 
only our sales to the military government sector declined in  when compared to our best sales improvements in were in our sales to computer peripherals industry of  and to the instrumentation industry of  interest and other income decreased approximately  in the year ended december   compared to the preceding year 
the decrease was due to gain on the disposition of a building in scotland in the year ending december  approximately of our consolidated sales for were made to five customers 
illinois tool works itw is the only customer that accounts for more than of our total sales 
the loss of or substantial reduction of sales to any major customer would have an adverse effect on our operations if such sales were not replaced

the company experienced higher material costs as a percentage of sales  at percent of sales for the products manufactured in  compared to in the preceding year

average inventory turnover was and times for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in inventory turnover is primarily due to our increased sales in cash used in investing activities in was approximately  compared to approximately  in the preceding year 
cash used in investing activities was primarily comprised of approximately  for purchases of machinery and equipment for our new manufacturing facility in mexico  lead free solder machinery in order to comply with new requirements  and the payment of approximately  additional earn out consideration in respect of the acquisition of simclar mexico  inc  offset by cash received as part of the snai acquisition of approximately  and approximately  in proceeds from the sale of surplus equipment

the breach of any of these covenants would result in a default under our debt 
a default in the covenants would permit bos to accelerate the maturity of our credit facilities and to sell the assets securing them  which could cause us to cease operations or seek bankruptcy protection 
our indebtedness requires us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt  which could reduce amounts for working capital and other general corporate purposes

critical accounting policies we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 
based on historical information  we believe that our allowance is adequate 
however  changes in general economic  business and market conditions could affect the ability of customers to make their required payments  therefore  the allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed monthly and changes to the allowance are updated as new information is received 
allowance for inventory obsolescence we maintain an allowance for inventory obsolescence for losses resulting from inventory items becoming unusable in the manufacturing operations due to loss of a specific customer or a customer s product changes or discontinuations 
based on historical and projected sales information and concentration of customers  we believe that the allowance is adequate 
however  changes in general economic  business and market conditions could cause customers to cancel  reduce or reschedule orders 
these changes could affect the company inventory turnover  therefore  the allowance for inventory obsolescence is reviewed monthly and changes to the allowance are updated as new information is received

index to financial statements income taxes deferred income taxes at the end of each period are determined by applying enacted tax rates applicable to future periods in which the taxes are expected to be paid or recovered to differences between the financial accounting and tax basis of assets and liabilities 
the decision to record a valuation allowance requires varying degrees of judgment based upon the nature of the item giving rise to the deferred tax asset 
as a result of continued operating losses incurred by snai  the inability to offset consolidated taxable income with the acquired net operating loss carry forwards  and uncertainty as to the timing of profitability in future periods  we have established a valuation allowance against all snai net operating loss carry forwards 
should future taxable income of snai be materially different from our estimates  changes in the valuation allowance could occur that would impact our tax expense in the future 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  long lived assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
when required  impairment losses on assets to be held and used are recognized based on the fair value of the asset 
the fair value of these assets is determined based upon estimates of future cash flows  market value of similar assets  if available  or independent appraisals  if required 
in analyzing the fair value and recoverability using future cash flows  we make projections based on a number of assumptions and estimates of growth rates  future economic conditions  assignment of discount rates and estimates of terminal values 
an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the long lived asset is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows 
the measurement of impairment loss is the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset 
long lived assets to be disposed of and or held for sale are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
we determine the fair value of these assets in the same manner as described for assets held and used 
see long lived asset impairment in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles are required to be evaluated for impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise  using a fair value based test that compares the fair value of the asset to its carrying value 
fair values are typically calculated using discounted expected future cash flows  using a risk adjusted discount rate 
the company performed the annual test for goodwill impairment related to the lytton and simclar mexico acquisitions 
these tests were performed at the reporting unit level 
in the test  we determined that the discounted sum of the expected future cash flows exceeded the invested capital of the reporting units  therefore  no impairment of goodwill was recognized 
in performing the tests for impairment  we made assumptions about future sales and profitability 
in estimating expected future cash flows related to lytton and simclar mexico  we used internal forecasts that were based upon actual results  assuming an average revenue growth of and per year  respectively  and minimal increases in gross margin 
the most critical estimates  in order of significance  used in the impairment test include estimated revenue growth  the terminal value assumed  and the discount rate applied 
we cannot predict the occurrence of future impairment triggering events nor the impact such events might have on reported asset values 
such events may include strategic decisions made in response to economic conditions relative to operations and the impact of technology  economic conditions  and industry trends on our customer base 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable the company s sales are primarily derived from product manufacturing including  but not limited to  finished molded and non molded cables  wiring harnesses  printed circuit board assemblies  electro mechanical and electronic assemblies 
revenue is recognized upon shipment of the product to the customer  under contractual terms  which are generally fob shipping point

business combinations we are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired business to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed  based on their estimated fair values 
such valuations require us to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially related to intangible assets 
critical estimates were used in valuing certain intangible assets and plant and equipment include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from acquired customers continuing sales  and the expected useful life of plant and equipment
