item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition of hanover compressor company should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto in item of this form k 
overview we are a global market leader in the full service natural gas compression business and are also a leading provider of service  fabrication and equipment for oil and natural gas production processing and transportation applications 
we sell and rent this equipment and provide complete operation and maintenance services  including run time guarantees  for both customer owned equipment and our fleet of rental equipment 
hanover was founded as a delaware corporation in  and has been a public company since our customers include both major and independent oil and gas producers and distributors as well as national oil and gas companies in the countries in which we operate 
our maintenance business  together with our parts and service business  provides solutions to customers that own their own compression and surface production and processing equipment  but want to outsource their operations 
we also fabricate compressor and oil and gas production and processing equipment and provide gas processing and treating  and oilfield power generation services  primarily to our us and international customers as a complement to our compression services 
in addition  through our subsidiary  belleli  we provide engineering  procurement and construction services primarily related to the manufacturing of heavy wall reactors for refineries and construction of desalinization plants and tank farms  primarily for use in europe and the middle east 
competitive strengths we believe we have the following key competitive strengths total solutions provider we believe that we are the only company in our industry that offers both outsourced rental of  as well as the sale of  compression and oil and gas production and processing equipment and related services 
our services include complete operation and maintenance services  including run time guarantees  for both customer owned equipment and our fleet of rental equipment  as well as engineering and product design  fabrication  installation  customer service and after market support 
our global customer base consists of us and international companies engaged in all aspects of the oil and gas industry  including large integrated oil and gas companies  national oil and gas companies  independent producers and natural gas processors  gatherers and pipelines 
by offering a broad range of services that complement our historic strengths  we believe that we can provide comprehensive integrated global solutions to meet our customers oil and gas production and processing equipment and compression needs 
we believe the breadth and quality of our services and rental fleet  the depth of our customer relationships and our presence in many major gas producing regions place us in a position to capture additional outsourced business on a global basis 
leading position in high horsepower compression high horsepower compression  composed of units with greater than horsepower  is the largest portion of our rental fleet  based on horsepower 
we believe we are a leading provider of these units  which are typically installed on larger wells  gathering systems and processing and treating facilities 
the scale and more attractive unit economics of these facilities generally insulate them from declining commodity prices 
as a result  compressors in this segment tend to realize higher utilization rates 
we believe that the greater technical requirements of these larger systems enable us to differentiate our compression products and to leverage sales of related products and services 
provider of superior customer service to facilitate our total solutions approach  we have adopted a geographical business unit concept and utilize a decentralized management and operating structure to provide superior customer service in a relationship driven  service intensive industry 
we believe that our regionally based network  local presence  experience and in depth 
table of contents knowledge of customers operating needs and growth plans enable us to effectively meet their evolving demands on a more timely basis 
our salespeople pursue the rental and sales market for our products and services in their respective territories 
our efforts concentrate on demonstrating our commitment to enhancing the customer s cash flow through superior product design  fabrication  installation  customer service and after market support 
international experience we believe we are a leader in natural gas compression as well as service and fabrication of equipment for oil and natural gas processing and transportation services in latin america  with an expanding presence in west africa  the middle and far east and russia 
as of december   we had approximately  horsepower of compression deployed internationally  of which approximately was located in latin america primarily in venezuela  argentina  mexico and brazil 
during  we opened offices in nigeria  the middle and far east and russia 
we believe our experience in managing our international operations and our efforts to develop and expand our international sales force have created a global platform from which we can continue to grow in international markets 
business strategy we intend to continue to capitalize on our competitive strengths to meet our customers needs through the following key strategies focus on core operations 
we have built our leading market position through our strengths in compression rentals  compressor fabrication  production and processing equipment rental and fabrication and parts and service 
we are focusing our efforts on these businesses and on streamlining operations in our core markets 
in an effort to intensify our focus on our core operations  during and we substantially completed the sale of our discontinued operations 
we believe this focused approach will enable us to enhance our growth prospects and returns 
in addition  we are actively pursuing improvements in our us fleet utilization by prudently employing additional units  moving idle us units into service in international markets and retiring less profitable units in order to improve our utilization and enhance the returns for our business 
we have also converted one of our facilities to refurbish approximately  horsepower of idle us compression assets so we can deploy these units in both our domestic and international rental businesses 
expand international presence 
international markets continue to represent the greatest growth opportunity for our business 
we believe that these markets are underserved in the area of the products and services we offer 
in addition  we typically see higher returns in international markets relative to the united states 
we intend to allocate additional resources toward international markets  to open offices abroad  where appropriate  and to move idle us units into service in international markets  where applicable 
continuing development of product lines 
we intend to continue to develop and deliver products and services beyond the rental and sale of compression equipment  including production and or processing equipment  engineering  installation  and operating services 
as we move forward  we are seeing new opportunities driven more by our ability to deliver a total solution rather than just a single product 
a total solution will typically incorporate multiple hanover product offerings 
we believe that this will enable us to capitalize on and expand our existing client relationships and enhance our revenue and returns from each individual project 
focus on process improvement 
we plan to focus on process improvements by consistently reviewing and rationalizing our existing business lines 
we have developed a more disciplined and systematic approach to evaluating return on capital  exercising cost controls and operating and managing our business 
we will continue to take the best practices from across our organization and formalize these practices into common company wide standards that we expect will bring improved operating and financial performance 
in addition  we intend to take advantage of our recently implemented enterprise resource planning system platform to help us 
table of contents better evaluate our markets and business opportunities  operate and maintain our assets and make more informed and timely decisions 
disciplined use of capital 
we intend to continue to focus on our capital discipline  as we believe it will better position us for growth and enhanced returns 
during  we used proceeds from our equity offering to decrease our outstanding debt and compression equipment lease obligations by approximately million 
during  we used cash flows from operations and asset sales to reduce our outstanding debt and compression equipment lease obligations by approximately million 
as a result  we achieved our objective to reduce our debt and compression equipment lease obligations by million from through market conditions our operations depend upon the levels of activity in natural gas development  production  processing and transportation 
such activity levels typically decline when there is a significant reduction in oil and gas prices or significant instability in energy markets 
in recent years  oil and gas prices have been extremely volatile 
due to a deterioration in market conditions  we experienced a decline in the demand for our products and services in and  which  along with the distractions associated with our management reorganization  resulted in reductions in the utilization of our compressor rental fleet and our revenues  gross margins and profits 
our revenues increased during and  which we believe resulted from an improvement in market conditions and our focus on sales success ratio 
in  we intend to continue our focus on improving our operating margins 
the north american rig count increased by to  at december  from  at december   and the twelve month rolling average north american rig count increased by to  at december  from  at december  in addition  the twelve month rolling average new york mercantile exchange wellhead natural gas price increased to per mmbtu at december  from per mmbtu at december  despite the increase in natural gas prices and the recent increase in the rig count  us natural gas production levels have not significantly changed 
recently  we have not experienced any significant growth in us rentals of equipment  which we believe is primarily the result of i the lack of immediate availability of compression equipment in the configuration currently in demand by our customers  ii increases in purchases of compression equipment by oil and gas companies that have available capital and iii the lack of a significant increase in us natural gas production levels 
however  improved market conditions have led to improved pricing and demand for equipment in the us market 
summary of results net losses 
we recorded a consolidated net loss of million for the year ended december   as compared to consolidated net losses of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our results for the year ended were affected by a number of charges that may not necessarily be indicative of our core operations or our future prospects and impact comparability between years 
these special items are discussed in year ended december  compared to year ended december  below

during the year ended december   we paid approximately million in employee separation costs  implemented further cost saving initiatives and closed two facilities in addition to the four fabrication facilities we closed pursuant to our original reduction plan 
we completed this plan during the year ended december  and we paid an additional million in employee separation costs related to the completion of these activities 
from december  to december   our us headcount decreased by approximately employees under this plan 
critical accounting estimates this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and accounting policies  including those related to bad debts  inventories  fixed assets  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  revenue recognition and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of this process form the basis of our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ 
table of contents from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and these differences can be material to our financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
allowances and reserves we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of a customer deteriorates  resulting in an impairment of its ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable 
we determine the allowance based on historical write off experience 
we review the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts monthly 
balances aged greater than days are reviewed individually for collectibility 
in addition  all other balances are reviewed based on significance and customer payment histories 
account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote 
as of december   our largest account receivable from a customer was approximately million 
during  and  we recorded approximately million  million  and million in additional allowances for doubtful accounts  respectively 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those expected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
during  and  we recorded approximately million  million  and million  respectively  in additional reserves for obsolete and slow moving inventory 
long lived assets and investments we review for the impairment of long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment and assets held for sale whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss exists when estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are less than its carrying amount 
when necessary  an impairment loss is recognized and represents the excess of the asset s carrying value as compared to its estimated fair value and is charged to the period in which the impairment occurred 
the determination of what constitutes an indication of possible impairment  the estimation of future cash flows and the determination of estimated fair value are all significant judgments 
there were no significant impairment in or during  as a result of the review of our rental fleet  we recorded million in additional depreciation on equipment that was retired and equipment that was expected to be sold or abandoned 
in addition  we perform an annual goodwill impairment test  pursuant to the requirements of sfas  in the fourth quarter of each year or whenever events indicate impairment may have occurred  to determine if the estimated recoverable value of the reporting unit exceeds the net carrying value of the reporting unit  including the applicable goodwill 
we determine the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of the expected present value of future cash flows and a market approach 
the present value of future cash flows is estimated using our most recent forecast  the weighted average cost of capital and a market multiple on the reporting units earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortization 
changes in forecasts could affect the estimated fair value of our reporting units and result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period 
there were no impairments in or related to our annual goodwill impairment test 
during  we recorded million in goodwill impairments as a result of evaluations of our goodwill 
see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form for a discussion of this impairment 
we hold investments in companies having operations or technology in areas that relate to our business 
we record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a 
table of contents decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
tax assets we must estimate our expected future taxable income in order to assess the realizability of our deferred income tax assets 
as of december   we reported a net deferred tax liability of million  which included gross deferred tax assets of million  net of a valuation allowance of million and gross deferred tax liabilities of million 
numerous assumptions are inherent in the estimation of future taxable income  including assumptions about matters that are dependent on future events  such as future operating conditions and future financial conditions 
additionally  we must consider any prudent and feasible tax planning strategies that might minimize the amount of tax liabilities recognized or the amount of any valuation allowance recognized against deferred tax assets 
we must also consider if we have the ability to implement these strategies should the forecasted conditions actually occur 
the principal tax planning strategy available to us relates to the permanent reinvestment of the earnings of international subsidiaries 
assumptions related to the permanent reinvestment of the earnings of international subsidiaries are reconsidered periodically to give effect to changes in our businesses and in our tax profile 
as a result of continued operating losses  we are in a net deferred tax asset position for us income tax purposes 
due to our cumulative us losses  we cannot reach the conclusion that it is more likely than not that certain of our us deferred tax assets will be realized in the future and we have recorded a valuation allowance on our net us deferred tax asset position 
we will be required to record additional valuation allowances if our us deferred tax asset position is increased and the more likely than not criteria of sfas is not met 
in addition  we have recorded valuation allowances for certain international jurisdictions 
if we are required to record additional valuation allowances in the united states or any other jurisdictions  our effective tax rate will be impacted  perhaps substantially  compared to the statutory rate 
our preliminary analysis leads us to believe that we will likely be required to record additional valuation allowances in  unless we are able to generate additional taxable earnings or implement additional tax planning strategies that would minimize or eliminate the amount of such additional valuation allowance 
revenue recognition percentage of completion accounting we recognize revenue and profit for our fabrication operations as work progresses on long term  fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion method  which relies on estimates of total expected contract revenue and costs 
we follow this method because reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be made and because the fabrication projects usually last several months 
recognized revenues and profit are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion 
revisions in profit estimates are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
the average duration of these projects is three to thirty six months 
due to the long term nature of some of our jobs  developing the estimates of cost often requires significant judgment 
we estimate percentage of completion for compressor and processing equipment fabrication on a direct labor hour to total labor hour basis 
this calculation requires management to estimate the number of total labor hours required for each project and to estimate the profit expected on the project 
production and processing equipment fabrication percentage of completion is estimated using the direct labor hour and cost to total cost basis 
the cost to total cost basis requires us to estimate the amount of total costs labor and materials required to complete each project 
since we have many fabrication projects in process at any given time  we do not believe that materially different results would be achieved if different estimates  assumptions  or conditions were used for any single project 

table of contents factors that must be considered in estimating the work to be completed and ultimate profit include labor productivity and availability  the nature and complexity of work to be performed  the impact of change orders  availability of raw materials and the impact of delayed performance 
if the aggregate combined cost estimates for all of our fabrication businesses had been higher or lower by in  our results of operations before tax would have been decreased or increased by approximately million 
as of december   we had recognized approximately million in estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts 
contingencies and litigation we are substantially self insured for worker s compensation  employer s liability  property  auto liability  general liability and employee group health claims in view of the relatively high per incident deductibles we absorb under our insurance arrangements for these risks 
losses up to deductible amounts are estimated and accrued based upon known facts  historical trends and industry averages 
we review these estimates quarterly and believe such accruals to be adequate 
however  insurance liabilities are difficult to estimate due to unknown factors  including the severity of an injury  the determination of our liability in proportion to other parties  timely reporting of occurrences  ongoing treatment or loss mitigation  general trends in litigation recovery outcomes and the effectiveness of safety and risk management programs 
therefore  if actual experience differs from the assumptions and estimates used for recording the liabilities  adjustments may be required and would be recorded in the period that the experience becomes known 
as of december  and  we have recorded approximately million and million  respectively  in claim reserves 
in the ordinary course of business  we are involved in various pending or threatened legal actions 
while we are unable to predict the ultimate outcome of these actions  sfas  accounting for contingencies requires management to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain 
we are required to record and have recorded a loss during any period in which we believe  based on our experience  a contingency is probable of resulting in a financial loss to us 
in making its determinations of likely outcomes of pending or threatened legal matters  management considers the evaluation of counsel knowledgeable about each matter

in april  we issued the million contingent note related to the securities settlement 
the note was payable  together with accrued interest  on march  but was extinguished with no money owing under it under the terms of the note since our common stock traded above the average price of per share for consecutive trading days during the third quarter of as a result of the cancellation of the note in the third quarter of  we reversed the note and the embedded derivative  which resulted in a million reduction to the cost of the securities related litigation

as a result  during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   our interest expense increased million to million and our leasing expense decreased million to the increase in our combined interest and leasing expense was primarily due to an increase in the overall effective interest rate on outstanding debt to from during the years ended december  and  respectively 
foreign currency translation for the year ended december  was a gain of million  compared to a loss of million for the year ended december  for the year ended december   foreign currency translation included million in translation gains related to the re measurement of our international subsidiaries dollar denominated inter company debt 

table of contents the following table summarizes the exchange gains and losses we recorded for assets exposed to currency translation in thousands year ended december  italy argentina venezuela all other countries exchange gain loss at december  we had intercompany advances outstanding to our subsidiary in italy of approximately million 
these advances are denominated in us dollars 
the impact of the remeasurement of these advances on our statement of operations by our subsidiary will depend on the outstanding balance in future periods 
the remeasurement of these advances in resulted in a translation gain of approximately million 
for the year ended december   other expenses included million in charges primarily recorded to write off certain non revenue producing assets and to record the settlement of a contractual obligation 
during  we recorded a million non cash charge for goodwill impairment associated with belleli 
as a result of the war in iraq  the strengthening of the euro and generally unfavorable economic conditions  we believe that the estimated fair value of belleli declined significantly during upon gaining complete control of belleli and assessing our long term growth strategy  we determined that these general factors in combination with the specific economic factors impacting belleli had significantly and adversely impacted the timing and amount of the future cash flows that we expected belleli to generate 
during  we determined the present value of belleli s expected future cash flows was less than our carrying value of belleli 
provision for securities litigation settlement hanover and certain of its past and present officers and directors were named as defendants in a consolidated federal court action that included a putative securities class action  arising under the employee retirement income security act erisa and shareholder derivative actions 
the litigation related principally to the matters involved in the transactions underlying the restatements of our financial statements 
the plaintiffs alleged  among other things  that we and the other defendants acted unlawfully and fraudulently in connection with those transactions and our original disclosures related to those transactions and thereby violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and the other defendants fiduciary duties to hanover 
on october   we entered into a stipulation of settlement  which settled all of the claims underlying the putative securities class action  the putative erisa class action and the shareholder derivative actions described above 
the terms of the settlement required us to make a cash payment of approximately million of which million was funded by payments from hanover s directors and officers insurance carriers  issue million shares of our common stock  and issue a contingent note with a principal amount of million 
in april  we issued the million contingent note related to the securities settlement 
the note was payable  together with accrued interest  on march   but was extinguished with no money owing under it under the terms of the note since our common stock traded above the average price of per share for consecutive trading days during the third quarter of in addition  upon the occurrence of a change of control that involved us  if the change of control or shareholder approval of the change of control occurred before february   which was twelve months after final court approval of the settlement  we would have been obligated to contribute an additional million to the settlement fund 
as part of the settlement  we implemented certain corporate governance enhancements  allowed shareholders 
table of contents owning more than but less than of our outstanding common stock to participate in the process to appoint two independent directors to our board of directors pursuant to which on february  we appointed margaret k 
dorman and stephen m 
pazuk to our board of directors  and made certain enhancements to our code of conduct 
gkh  which  as of december   owned approximately of hanover s outstanding common stock and which sold shares in our march secondary offering of common stock  are parties to the settlement and have agreed to settle claims against them that arise out of that offering as well as other potential securities  erisa  and derivative claims 
the terms of the settlement required gkh to transfer million shares of hanover common stock from their holdings or from other sources to the settlement fund 
on october   the parties moved the united states district court for the southern district of texas for preliminary approval of the proposed settlement and sought permission to provide notice to the potentially affected persons and to set a date for a final hearing to approve the proposed settlement 
on december   the court held a hearing and granted the parties motion for preliminary approval of the proposed settlement and  among other things  ordered that notice be provided to appropriate persons and set the date for the final hearing 
the final hearing was held on february   and no objections to the settlement or requests to be excluded from the terms of the settlement had been received prior to the deadline set by the court 
on february   the united states district court for the southern district of texas entered three orders and final judgments  approving the settlement on the terms agreed upon in the stipulation of settlement with respect to all of the claims described above 
the court also entered an order and final judgment approving the plans of allocation with respect to each action  as well as an order and final judgment approving the schedule of attorneys fees for counsel for the settling plaintiffs 
the time in which these orders and final judgments may be appealed expired on march  without any appeal being lodged 
the settlement has therefore become final and has been implemented according to its terms 
in march  we issued and delivered to the escrow agent for the settlement fund million shares of hanover common stock  as required by the settlement 
based on the terms of the settlement agreement and the individual components of the settlement  we recorded the cost of the litigation settlement 
the details of the litigation settlement charge were as follows in thousands cash estimated fair value of note to be issued common stock to be issued by hanover legal fees and administrative costs total less insurance recoveries net litigation settlement the million estimated fair value of the note issued was based on the present value of the future cash flows discounted at borrowing rates which were available to us for debt with similar terms and maturities 
using a market borrowing rate of  the principal value and the stipulated interest rate required by the note of per annum  a discount of million was computed on the note to be issued 
upon the issuance of the note  the discount was amortized to interest expense over the term of the note 
because the note could be extinguished without a payment if our common stock traded at or above the average price of per share for consecutive trading days at any time between march  and march   we were required to record an asset when the note was issued for the value of the embedded derivative  as required by sfas we estimated the value of the derivative and reduced the amount we included for the estimate of the value of the note by approximately million at december  this asset was marked to market with any increase 
table of contents or decrease included in our statement of operations until extinguished 
as a result of the cancellation of the note in the third quarter of  we reversed the note and the embedded derivative  which resulted in a million reduction to the cost of the securities related litigation 
income taxes the provision for income taxes increased million  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the average effective income tax rates during the year ended december  and december  were and  respectively 
the change in rate was primarily due to the following factors significant decrease in losses before tax during the year ended december   decrease in the valuation allowance recorded for us deferred tax assets where realization is uncertain  and inclusion in taxable income of earnings repatriated from canada 
as a result of operating losses in  we were in a net deferred tax asset position for us income tax purposes for the first time in due to our cumulative us tax losses  we cannot reach the conclusion that it is more likely than not that certain of our us deferred tax assets will be realized in the future 
we will be required to record additional valuation allowances if our us deferred tax asset position is increased and the more likely than not criteria of sfas is not met 
in addition  we have provided valuation allowances for certain international jurisdictions 
if we are required to record additional valuation allowances in the united states or any other jurisdictions  our effective tax rate will be impacted  perhaps substantially compared to the statutory rate 
discontinued operations income from discontinued operations decreased million  to net income of million during the year ended december   from income of million during the year ended december  the decrease in income from discontinued operations was due to the dispositions that occurred in and during the fourth quarter of  we sold the compression rental assets of our canadian subsidiary  hanover canada corporation  to universal compression canada  a subsidiary of universal compression holdings  inc  for approximately million 
additionally  in december we sold our ownership interest in ces for approximately million to an entity owned by steven collicutt 
hanover owned approximately million shares in ces  which represented approximately of the ownership interests of ces 
during  we recorded a million gain net of tax related to the sale of hanover canada corporation and ces 
during the fourth quarter of  we sold an asset held for sale related to our discontinued power generation business for approximately million and realized a gain of approximately million 
this asset was sold to a subsidiary of the wood group 
the wood group owns of the simco harwat consortium  a joint venture gas compression project in venezuela in which we hold a ownership interest 
during the fourth quarter of  we reviewed our business lines and the board of directors approved management s recommendation to exit and sell our non oilfield power generation and certain used equipment business lines 
in  we recorded an additional million charge net of tax to write down our investment in discontinued operations to their current estimated market value 
cumulative effect of accounting change we recorded a cumulative effect of accounting change of million  net of tax  related to the adoption of fin on july  prior to july   we had entered into lease transactions that were recorded as a sale and leaseback of the compression equipment and were treated as operating leases for financial reporting purposes 
on july   we adopted the provisions of fin as they relate to the five special 
table of contents purpose entities that leased compression equipment to us 
as a result of the adoption  we added approximately  million in compressor equipment assets  million of accumulated depreciation including approximately million of accumulated depreciation related to periods before the sale and leaseback of the equipment   million in debt and million in minority interest obligations to our balance sheet  and we reversed million of deferred gains that were recorded on our balance sheet as a result of the sale leaseback transactions 
on july   we recorded a million charge million net of tax to record the cumulative effect from the adoption of fin related to prior period depreciation of the compression equipment assets 
leasing transactions and accounting change for fin as of december  we are the lessee in two transactions involving the sale of compression equipment by us to special purpose entities  which in turn lease the equipment back to us 
at the time we entered into the leases  these transactions had a number of advantages over other sources of capital then available to us 
the sale leaseback transactions enabled us to affordably extend the duration of our financing arrangements and reduced our cost of capital 
in august and in connection with the acquisition of production operators corporation poc  we completed two sale leaseback transactions involving certain compression equipment 
under one sale leaseback transaction  we received million in proceeds from the sale of certain compression equipment 
under the second sale leaseback transaction  we received million in proceeds from the sale of additional compression equipment 
under the first transaction  the equipment was sold and leased back by us for a seven year period and will continue to be deployed by us in the normal course of our business 
the agreement originally called for semi annual rental payments of approximately million in addition to quarterly rental payments of approximately million 
due to the partial redemption in september  as discussed below  semi annual rental payments are now approximately million in addition to quarterly rental payments of approximately million

we have options to repurchase the equipment under certain conditions as defined by the lease agreements 
we incurred transaction costs of approximately million related to these transactions 
these costs are included in intangible and other assets and are being amortized over the respective lease terms 
in october  we completed a million sale leaseback transaction of compression equipment 
in march  we entered into a separate million sale leaseback transaction of compression equipment 
under the march transaction  we received proceeds of million from the sale of compression equipment at the first closing in march  and in august  we completed the second half of the equipment lease and received an additional million for the sale of additional compression equipment 
under our lease agreements  the equipment was sold and leased back by us for a five year term and was used by us in our business 
the lease agreements call for variable quarterly payments that fluctuate with the london interbank offering rate and have covenant restrictions similar to our bank credit facility 
we incurred an aggregate of approximately million in transaction costs for the leases entered into in  which were included in intangible and other assets on the balance sheet and were amortized over the respective lease terms of the respective transactions 
during september  we redeemed million in indebtedness and repaid million in minority interest obligations under our a compression equipment lease obligations using proceeds from the august public offering of our common stock 
during february  we repaid our b compression equipment lease obligations using borrowings from our bank credit facility 
during  we used cash flow from operations and proceeds from asset dispositions to exercise our purchase option and to reduce our outstanding debt and minority interest obligations by million under our b compressor equipment lease 
in june we issued sec registered 
table of contents notes under a then effective shelf registration statement and exercised our purchase options under the march and august compression equipment operating leases 
as of december   the remaining compression assets owned by the entities that lease equipment to us but are now included in property  plant and equipment in our consolidated financial statements had a net book value of approximately million  including improvements made to these assets after the sale leaseback transactions

we are entitled under the compression equipment operating lease agreements to substitute equipment that we own for equipment owned by the special purpose entities  provided that the value of the equipment that we are substituting is equal to or greater than the value of the equipment that is being substituted 
each lease agreement limits the aggregate amount of replacement equipment that may be substituted to under each lease 
in january  the fasb issued fin the primary objectives of fin are to provide guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved by means other than through voting rights and the determination of when and which business enterprise should consolidate a vie in its financial statements 
fin applies to an entity in which either the equity investors if any do not have a controlling financial interest or the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity s activities without receiving additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
in addition  fin requires that both the primary beneficiary and all other enterprises with a significant variable interest in a vie make additional disclosures 
as revised  fin was effective immediately for vie s created after january  for special purposes entities created prior to february   fin was effective at the first interim or annual reporting period ending after december   or december  for us 
for entities  other than special purpose entities  created prior to february   fin was effective for us as of march  in addition  fin allowed companies to elect to adopt early the provisions of fin for some  but not all  of the variable interest entities they own 
prior to july   these lease transactions were recorded as a sale and leaseback of the compression equipment and were treated as operating leases for financial reporting purposes 
on july   we adopted the provisions of fin as they relate to the five special purpose entities that leased compression equipment to us 
as a result of the adoption  we added approximately  million in compressor equipment assets  million of accumulated depreciation including approximately million of accumulated depreciation related to periods before the sale and leaseback of the equipment   million in debt and million in minority interest obligations to our balance sheet  and we reversed million of deferred gains that were recorded on our balance sheet as a result of the sale leaseback transactions 
on july   we recorded a million charge million net of tax to record the cumulative effect from the adoption of fin related to prior period depreciation of the compression equipment assets 
the minority interest obligations represent the equity of the entities that lease compression equipment to us 
in accordance with the provisions of our compression equipment lease obligations  the equity certificate holders are entitled to quarterly or semi annual yield payments on the aggregate outstanding equity certificates 
as of december   the yield rates on the outstanding equity 
table of contents certificates ranged from to 
equity certificate holders may receive a return of capital payment upon lease termination or our purchase of the leased compression equipment after full payment of all debt obligations of the entities that lease compression equipment to us 
at december   the carrying value of the minority interest obligations approximated the fair market value of assets that would be required to be transferred to redeem the minority interest obligations 
liquidity and capital resources our unrestricted cash balance amounted to million at december  compared to million at december  working capital increased to million at december  from million at december  the increase in working capital was primarily the result of an increase in accounts receivable and inventory  partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and advanced billings  and resulted from an improvement in market conditions that has led to increased sales in our businesses

the increase in cash used in investing activities during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was primarily attributable to an increase during in capital expenditures to support the increased sales in our businesses 
the decrease in cash used in financing activities during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was primarily due a net decrease in cash used to pay off debt 
during  cash flows from operating activities were primarily used to pay down debt 
the decrease in cash provided by discontinued operations during the year ended december  was principally related to the sale of our canadian rental fleet which was discontinued and sold in november we may carry out new customer projects through rental fleet additions and other related capital expenditures 
we generally invest funds necessary to make these rental fleet additions when our idle equipment cannot economically fulfill a project s requirements and the new equipment expenditure is matched with long term contracts whose expected economic terms exceed our return on capital targets 
we currently plan to spend approximately million to million on net capital expenditures during including rental equipment fleet additions and approximately million to million on equipment maintenance capital 
projected maintenance capital for includes the cost of our program to refurbish approximately  horsepower of idle us compression equipment 
we have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock since our formation and do not anticipate paying such dividends in the foreseeable future

debt refinancing repayment 
in june  we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec pursuant to which we registered delayed public offerings of equity  debt or other securities in an 
table of contents aggregate amount not to exceed million 
the sec declared the shelf registration statement effective on november  in december  we issued under our shelf registration statement million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due  which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis by hclp 
the proceeds from this offering were used to repay the outstanding indebtedness and minority interest obligations of million and million  respectively  under our a equipment lease that was to expire in june also in december  we issued under our shelf registration statement million aggregate principal amount of our convertible senior notes due we may redeem these convertible notes beginning in under certain circumstances 
the convertible notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion rate of shares of our common stock per  principal amount of the convertible notes subject to adjustment in certain events at any time prior to the stated maturity of the convertible notes or the redemption or repurchase of the convertible notes by us

the net proceeds from this offering were used to redeem million in indebtedness and repay million in minority interest obligations under our a compression equipment lease obligations during september in connection with the redemption and repayment of a portion of our a compression equipment lease obligations  we expensed million related to the call premium and million related to unamortized debt issuance costs 
the million of costs related to the call premium have been classified as debt extinguishment costs and the million related to unamortized debt issuance costs have been classified as depreciation and amortization expense on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
during february  we repaid our b compression equipment lease obligations using borrowings from our bank credit facility 
bank credit facility 
in november  we entered into a million bank credit facility having a maturity date of november  our prior million bank credit facility that was scheduled to mature in december was terminated upon closing of the new facility 
the new facility also provides for an incremental term loan facility of up to million 
the incremental term loan was undrawn at december  and was not syndicated with the credit facility 
the new agreement prohibits us without the lenders prior approval from declaring or paying any dividend other than dividends payable solely in our common stock or in options  warrants or rights to purchase such common stock on  or making similar payments with respect to  our capital stock 
borrowings under the new facility are secured by substantially all of our unencumbered personal property and real property assets 
in addition  all of the capital stock of domestic subsidiaries and of the capital stock of the first tier international subsidiaries has been pledged to secure the obligations under the new credit facility 
up to million of the credit facility can be borrowed in loans denominated in euros 
our bank credit facility contains certain financial covenants and limitations on  among other things  indebtedness  liens  leases and sales of assets

a commitment fee ranging from to  depending on our consolidated leverage ratio  times the average daily amount of the available commitment under the bank credit facility is payable quarterly to the lenders participating in the bank credit facility 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants and other requirements set forth in our bank credit facility  the indentures and agreements related to our compression equipment lease obligations and the indentures and agreements relating to our other long term debt 
while there is no assurance  we believe based on our current projections for that we will be in compliance with the financial covenants in these agreements 
a default under our bank credit facility or a default under certain of the various indentures and agreements would in some situations trigger cross default provisions under our bank credit facilities or the indentures and agreements relating to certain of our other debt obligations 
such defaults would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  financial position and operations 
we expect that our bank credit facility and cash flow from operations will provide us adequate capital resources to fund our estimated level of capital expenditures for as of december   we had million in outstanding borrowings under our bank credit facility 
outstanding amounts under our bank credit facilities bore interest at a weighted average rate of and at december  and  respectively

our new bank credit facility permits us to incur indebtedness  subject to covenant limitations  up to a million credit limit  plus  in addition to certain other indebtedness  an additional a million in unsecured indebtedness  b million of indebtedness of international subsidiaries and c million of secured purchase money indebtedness 
additional borrowings of up to million were available under that facility as of december  in addition to purchase money and similar obligations  the indentures and the agreements related to our compression equipment lease obligations for our a and b sale leaseback transactions  our senior notes due and our senior notes due permit us to incur indebtedness  at any time  of up to million under our bank credit facility  plus an additional million in unsecured indebtedness and to incur additional indebtedness  including further secured debt under our bank credit facility  so long as  after incurring such indebtedness  our ratio of the sum of consolidated net income before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation expense  amortization of intangibles  certain other non cash charges and rental expense to total fixed charges all as defined and adjusted by the agreements governing such obligations  or our coverage ratio  is greater than to  and no default or event of default has occurred or would occur as a consequence of incurring such additional indebtedness and the application of the proceeds thereof

prior to adoption of fin in  these securities were reported on our balance sheet as mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred securities 
because we only have a limited ability to make decisions about its activities and we are not the primary beneficiary of the trust  the trust is a vie under fin as such  the mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred securities issued by the trust are no longer reported on our balance sheet 
instead  we now report our subordinated notes payable to the trust as a debt 
these notes have previously been eliminated in our consolidated financial statements 
the changes related to our mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred securities for our balance sheet are reclassifications and had no impact on our consolidated results of operations or cash flow 
we do not have any credit rating downgrade provisions in our debt agreements or the agreements related to our compression equipment lease obligations that would accelerate their maturity dates 
however  a downgrade in our credit rating could materially and adversely affect our ability to renew existing  or obtain access to new  credit facilities in the future and could increase the cost of such facilities 
should this occur  we might seek alternative sources of funding 
in addition  our significant leverage puts us at greater risk of default under one or more of our existing debt agreements if we experience an adverse change to our financial condition or results of operations 
our ability to reduce our leverage depends upon market and economic conditions  as well as our ability to execute liquidity enhancing transactions such as sales of non core assets or our equity securities 
derivative financial instruments 
we use derivative financial instruments to minimize the risks and or costs associated with financial activities by managing our exposure to interest rate fluctuations on a portion of our debt and leasing obligations 
our primary objective is to reduce our overall cost of borrowing by managing the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our debt portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
the cash flow from hedges is classified in our consolidated statements of cash flows under the same category as the cash flows from the underlying assets  liabilities or anticipated transactions 
for derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges  the gain or loss is recognized in earnings in the period of change together with the gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged 
for derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges  the effective portion of the derivative gain or loss is included in other comprehensive income  but not reflected in our consolidated statement of operations until the corresponding hedged transaction is settled 
the ineffective portion is reported in earnings immediately 
in march  we entered into two interest rate swaps  which we designated as fair value hedges  to hedge the risk of changes in fair value of our senior notes due resulting from changes in interest rates 
these interest rate swaps  under which we receive fixed payments and make floating payments  result in the conversion of the hedged obligation into floating rate debt 
the following table 
table of contents summarizes  by individual hedge instrument  these interest rate swaps as of december  dollars in thousands fair value of fixed rate to be swap at floating rate to be paid maturity date received notional amount december  six month libor december    six month libor december    as of december   a total of approximately million in accrued liabilities  million in long term liabilities and a million reduction of long term debt was recorded with respect to the fair value adjustment related to these two swaps 
we estimate the effective floating rate  that is determined in arrears pursuant to the terms of the swap  to be paid at the time of settlement 
as of december  we estimated that the effective rate for the six month period ending in june would be approximately 
during  we entered into interest rate swaps to convert variable lease payments under certain lease arrangements to fixed payments as follows dollars in thousands fair value of swap at lease maturity date fixed rate to be paid notional amount december  march march   august march   these swaps  which we designated as cash flow hedging instruments  met the specific hedge criteria and any changes in their fair values were recognized in other comprehensive income 
during the years ended december   and  we recorded other comprehensive income of approximately million  million and million  respectively  related to these swaps million  million and million  respectively  net of tax 
on june   we repaid the outstanding indebtedness and minority interest obligations of million and million  respectively  under our a equipment lease 
as a result  the two interest rate swaps maturing on march   each having a notional amount of million  associated with the a equipment lease no longer meet specific hedge criteria and the unrealized loss related to the mark to market adjustment prior to june  of million was amortized into interest expense over the remaining life of the swap 
in addition  beginning june   changes in the mark to market adjustment were recognized as interest expense in the statement of operations 
during  we repaid approximately million of debt and minority interest obligations related to our october compressor equipment lease 
because we are no longer able to forecast the remaining variable payments under this lease  the interest rate swap could no longer be designated as a hedge 
because of these factors  in the fourth quarter we reclassed the million fair value that had been recorded in other comprehensive income into interest expense 
during december  we terminated this interest rate swap and made a payment of approximately million to the counterparty 
the counterparties to our interest rate swap agreements are major international financial institutions 
we monitor the credit quality of these financial institutions and do not expect non performance by any counterparty  although such financial institutions non performance  if it occurred  could have a material adverse effect on us 
off balance sheet arrangements we have agreed to guarantee obligations of indebtedness of the simco harwat consortium and of el furrial  each of which are joint ventures that we acquired interests in pursuant to our acquisition of poc 
each of these joint ventures is a non consolidated affiliate of hanover and our guarantee obligations are not recorded on our accompanying balance sheet 
our guarantee obligation is a 
table of contents percentage of the total debt of the non consolidated affiliate equal to our ownership percentage in such affiliate 
we have issued the following guarantees of the indebtedness of our non consolidated affiliates in thousands maximum potential undiscounted payments as of term december  simco harwat consortium el furrial our obligation to perform under the guarantees arises only in the event that our non consolidated affiliate defaults under the agreements governing the indebtedness

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate and foreign currency risk 
hanover and its subsidiaries periodically enter into interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
at december   the fair market value of our interest rate swaps  excluding the portion attributable to and included in accrued interest  was a net liability of approximately million  of which million was recorded in accrued liabilities and million in other long term liabilities 
at december  we were a party to two interest rate swaps to convert fixed rate debt to floating rate debt as follows dollars in thousands fair value of fixed rate swap at to be notional december  floating rate to be paid maturity date received amount six month libor december    six month libor december    at december   due to these two swaps  we were exposed to variable interest rates  which fluctuate with market interest rates  on million in notional debt 
assuming a hypothetical increase in the variable rates from those in effect at december   the increase in our annual interest expense with respect to such swaps would be approximately million 
at december   we were exposed to variable rental rates  which fluctuate with market interest rate  on a portion of the equipment leases we entered into in assuming a hypothetical increase in the variable rates from those in effect at year end  the increase in annual interest expense on the equipment lease notes would be approximately million 
we are also exposed to interest rate risk on borrowings under our floating rate bank credit facility 
at december   million was outstanding bearing interest at a weighted average effective rate of per annum 
assuming a hypothetical increase in the weighted average interest rate from those in effect at december   the increase in annual interest expense for advances under this facility would be approximately million 
we have significant operations that expose us to currency risk in argentina and venezuela 
to mitigate that risk  the majority of our existing contracts provide that we receive payment in  or based on  us dollars rather than argentine pesos and venezuelan bolivars  thus reducing our exposure to fluctuations in their value 
in february  the venezuelan government fixed the exchange rate to  bolivars for each us dollar 
in february and march  the venezuelan government devalued the currency to  bolivars and  bolivars  respectively  for each us dollar 
the impact of the devaluation on our results will depend upon the amount of our assets primarily working capital and deferred taxes exposed to currency fluctuation in venezuela in future periods 
for the year ended december   our argentine operations represented approximately of our revenue and of our gross profit 
for the year ended december   our venezuelan operations represented approximately of our revenue and of our gross profit 
at december   we had approximately million and million in accounts receivable related to our argentine and venezuelan operations 
in december  opponents of venezuelan president hugo ch vez initiated a country wide strike by workers of the national oil company in venezuela 
this strike  a two month walkout  had a significant negative impact on venezuela s economy and temporarily shut down a substantial portion of venezuela s oil industry 
as a result of the strike  venezuela s oil production dropped 
in addition  exchange controls have been put in place which put limitations on the amount of venezuelan currency that can be exchanged for foreign currency by businesses operating inside venezuela 
in may  after six months of negotiation  the organization of the american states brokered an accord between the venezuelan government and its opponents 
although the accord does offer the prospect of 
table of contents stabilizing venezuela s economy  if another national strike is staged  exchange controls remain in place  or economic and political conditions in venezuela continue to deteriorate  our results of operations in venezuela could be materially and adversely affected  which could result in reductions in our net income 
the economic situation in argentina and venezuela is subject to change 
to the extent that the situation deteriorates  exchange controls continue in place and the value of the peso and bolivar against the dollar is reduced further  our results of operations in argentina and venezuela could be materially and adversely affected which could result in reductions in our net income 
the following table summarizes the exchange gains and losses we recorded for assets exposed to currency translation in thousands year ended december  italy argentina venezuela canada all other countries exchange gain loss at december  we had intercompany advances outstanding to our subsidiary in italy of approximately million 
these advances are denominated in us dollars 
the impact of the remeasurement of these advances on our statement of operations by our subsidiary will depend on the outstanding balance in future periods 
a increase or decrease in the euro would result in a foreign currency translation gain or loss of approximately million
