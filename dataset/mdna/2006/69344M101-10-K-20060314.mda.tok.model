overview of our business we are an international provider of credit enhancement as well as other products that promote homeownership and facilitate mortgage transactions in the capital markets 
we divide our business into four segments us mortgage insurance operations 
we offer mortgage insurance products in the us that enable borrowers to buy homes with low down payment mortgages 
net income from us mortgage insurance operations was million in and million in  and includes pmi mortgage insurance co 
and its affiliated us mortgage insurance and reinsurance companies collectively  pmi  and equity in earnings from pmi s joint venture  cmg mortgage insurance company and its affiliated companies collectively  cmg 
international operations 
we offer mortgage insurance and other credit enhancement products in australia  new zealand  europe  and hong kong 
net income from our international operations segment was million in and million in financial guaranty 
we are the lead investor in fgic corporation  whose subsidiary  financial guaranty insurance company collectively  fgic  provides financial guaranty insurance 
we also have a significant interest in ram reinsurance company  ltd  or ram re  a financial guaranty reinsurance company based in bermuda 
net income from our financial guaranty segment was million in and million in other 
our other segment consists of our holding company and contract underwriting operations  equity in earnings losses from our former unconsolidated subsidiary  sps holding corp  or sps  and certain limited partnerships  and the discontinued operations of our former title insurance subsidiary  american pioneer title insurance company  or aptic 
our other segment generated net losses of million in and million in our sale of aptic in generated an after tax gain of million 

table of contents revenues and expenses our revenues from continuing operations consist primarily of premiums earned on our us and international mortgage insurance policies and credit enhancement products  net investment income on our investment portfolios  equity in earnings from our unconsolidated subsidiaries  primarily from fgic and cmg  and other income  including fees from contract underwriting services 
our expenses consist primarily of claims paid to policyholders  claims related expenses and changes in reserves  amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs  underwriting  acquisition and policy servicing costs  contract underwriting costs and remedies  and general administration and overhead expenses  interest and financing expenses  and income taxes 
conditions and trends affecting our business overview of financial results our consolidated net income was million in compared to million in consolidated net income in included a million after tax gain on sale of discontinued operations  partially offset by a million pre tax realized capital loss on our equity investment in sps 
our consolidated net income from continuing operations after taxes in was million compared to million in the increases in net income and net income from continuing operations after taxes in compared to were due primarily to higher premiums earned in u 
s mortgage insurance operations and pmi australia in  and increases in our equity in earnings from fgic in these increases were partially offset by higher losses and loss adjustment expenses  or lae  primarily from us mortgage insurance operations in  and an increase in net losses in our other segment in approximately of our consolidated total revenues in consisted of interest and dividend income associated with our billion consolidated investment portfolio 
accordingly  the performance of corporate and municipal bond and securities markets in the us  australia and europe can significantly affect our consolidated financial results 
our primary goal in managing our investment portfolios is to achieve a predictable level of income while maintaining adequate levels of liquidity and the preservation of capital 
growth of the portfolio and minimizing the realization of taxable gains are secondary considerations 
a substantial portion of our consolidated investment portfolio consists of investment grade fixed income securities 
trends and conditions affecting financial performance us mortgage insurance operations 
the financial performance of our us mortgage insurance operations segment is affected by a number of factors  including policy cancellations and persistency 
continued low interest rates and home price appreciation have driven heavy mortgage refinance activity and high policy cancellations  which in turn have negatively affected pmi s insurance in force 
while policy cancellations negatively affect pmi s insurance in force  cancellations due to borrower prepayments positively affect premiums earned on pmi s non refundable single and annual premium policies in the year in which the cancellations occur 
upon notification of cancellation of a loan under a non refundable single and annual premium policy  any unearned premium 
table of contents with respect to that loan is recognized as earned premium 
pmi s persistency rate  the percentage of insurance in force at the beginning of a month period that remains in force at the end of that period  was at december  compared to at december  if mortgage interest rates increase  we expect that refinancing activity will slow and  accordingly  that pmi s persistency rate will improve 
if home price appreciation slows  policy cancellations may decline  which would positively affect pmi s persistency rate 
new insurance written niw 
pmi s niw decreased by in compared to pmi s ability to write new mortgage insurance is directly affected by  among other factors  the sizes of the us mortgage origination  purchase money mortgage  and private mortgage insurance markets 
increased use of alternatives to private mortgage insurance  such as simultaneous seconds  piggyback    or loans  continues to negatively affect the size of the private mortgage insurance market and pmi s niw 
the use of such loans  which include a first mortgage lien with a loan to value  or ltv  of and a second mortgage lien of between and  has increased in the last four years 
the size of the private mortgage insurance market is also affected by the number of loans originated and sold to non agency investors and we believe that the level of non agency loans increased as a percentage of the total origination market in we also believe that the private mortgage insurance market had higher concentrations of loans of a type or credit quality that pmi has traditionally not insured to a great extent  thereby reducing pmi s niw 
credit and portfolio characteristics 
pmi s primary niw and primary risk in force in consisted of higher percentages of adjustable rate mortgages  or arms  alt a loans and high ltv loans compared to we consider a loan alt a if it has a credit score of or greater and has certain characteristics such as reduced documentation verifying the borrower s income  deposit information or employment 
we believe that these percentage increases reflect higher concentrations of arms  alt a and high ltv loans in the current mortgage origination and private mortgage insurance markets 
in  interest only loans  also known as deferred amortization loans  and payment option arms have been popular with some borrowers and pmi insured an increased amount of these loans in through its primary flow and structured transactions channels 
interest only loans and payment option arms have more exposure to declining home prices than fixed rate loans or traditional arms 
we expect higher default and claim rates for arms  option arms  interest only  alt a  and high ltv loans and incorporate these assumptions into our underwriting approach  portfolio limits  pricing  and loss and claim estimates 
we believe that the market trends discussed above may continue in losses and claims 
pmi s claims paid including lae increased by in compared to primarily as a result of the aging of pmi s insurance portfolio  an increased number of claims paid in that were previously delayed by bankruptcy protection  and  to a lesser extent  higher claim rates associated with the portion of pmi s portfolio that contains less than a quality loans with credit scores less than and alt a loans 
net loss reserves increased by million in primarily due to increases in pmi s expected claim rates as a result of changes in the business mix of pmi s portfolio  and increases in the number of loans in pmi s default inventory 
the increase in pmi s default inventory in was primarily due to the effects of the hurricanes 
captive reinsurance 
under captive reinsurance agreements  pmi transfers portions of its risk written on loans originated by certain lender customers to captive reinsurance companies affiliated with such lender customers 
in return  pmi cedes a proportionate amount of its gross premiums written to these captive reinsurance companies 
at december   of pmi s primary insurance in force was subject to captive reinsurance agreements  compared to at december  this increase was due to refinance activity resulting in heavy cancellations of policies not subject to captive reinsurance and a higher percentage of niw from pmi s flow channel being generated by customers with captive reinsurance agreements 
we expect that the percentage of pmi s primary flow insurance in force  primary flow risk in force and primary flow niw subject to captive reinsurance will continue to increase 
niw generated through pmi s structured channel are generally not subject to captive reinsurance agreements 

table of contents underwriting and operating expenses 
the profitability of our business depends in part on our ability to control our underwriting and operating expenses 
pmi s expense ratio  the ratio of total underwriting and operating expenses to net premiums written  was favorably impacted in by net premiums written associated with two large single premium structured transactions  lower deferred policy acquisition costs and higher average premium rates  partially offset by the increased use of captive reinsurance  which  by ceding portions of risk and premiums written on certain loans  decreases premiums written without fully offsetting decreases in underwriting expenses 
regulatory and legislative environment 
at any point in time  there are multiple proposals and initiatives for statutory and regulatory changes that may significantly affect the mortgage insurance industry as well as pmi s business 
we may also be impacted by changes in statutes and regulations affecting the gses  financial institutions and capital market participants 
international operations 
factors affecting the financial performance of our international operations segment include pmi australia 
while pmi australia s insurance in force increased from december  to december   pmi australia s niw decreased by in compared to this niw decrease in was primarily due to slowing australian mortgage origination and residential mortgage backed securities markets  increasingly competitive pricing and the restructuring of a major captive reinsurance arrangement causing the customer s affiliated captive reinsurer to retain higher levels of mortgage default risk 
the restructuring of this captive reinsurance arrangement will negatively impact pmi australia s premiums written in pmi australia s primary regulator  the australian prudential regulation authority  issued mortgage insurer capital requirements in and intends to implement basel ii capital requirements for financial institutions effective january  these requirements  as well as other regulatory proposals  have had and or will have an impact on both the mortgage insurance industry and the market for mortgage insurance in australia 
pmi europe 
pmi europe s net income was negatively impacted in as a result of additional provisions for profit sharing obligations associated with the uk lenders mortgage insurance portfolio acquired by pmi europe in from royal sun alliance r sa 
r sa and pmi europe share certain economic benefits if the acquired portfolio s loss performance reaches agreed upon levels 
based upon the favorable loss performance of this business to date  pmi europe increased expenses related to this profit sharing agreement and will continue to do so in the future unless the loss performance becomes less favorable 
pmi europe s net income in was also negatively impacted by a reduction in premiums earned associated with the acquired r sa portfolio 
we recognize premiums associated with this portfolio in accordance with established earnings patterns that are based upon management s estimation of the expiration of the portfolio s risk 
accordingly  we expect the premiums earned and risk in force associated with the portfolio to continue to decline through the remaining life of the portfolio 
foreign currency exchange fluctuations 
the performance of our international operations is subject to fluctuations in exchange rates between the reporting currency of the us dollar and the functional currencies of the australian dollar and the euro 
the change in the average foreign currency exchange rates from increased our international operations net income by million  primarily due to appreciation in the australian dollar 
this foreign currency translation impact is calculated using the year over year change in the average monthly exchange rates to the current period ending net income in the functional currencies 
in january  we purchased foreign exchange put options at a pre tax cost of million to partially mitigate the negative effects of a potential strengthening us dollar relative to either the australian dollar or the euro in the net expense recognized related to the acquired options was million in which was less than the total cost due to certain euro options that settled in the money 

table of contents financial guaranty 
factors affecting the financial performance of our financial guaranty segment include fgic 
the significant portion of our net income derived from our financial guaranty segment was generated by equity in earnings from fgic 
equity in earnings from fgic was million for compared to million for this increase was primarily due to increases in premiums  reflecting growth in scheduled premiums earned and increased refundings as well as higher investment income due to growth in fgic s investment portfolio 
these increases were partially offset by a million increase in reserves primarily related to insured obligations impacted by hurricane katrina 
fgic s financial performance is also affected by  among other things  interest rate movements  which may generate refundings  the volume of issuance in the public and structured finance markets and fgic s ability to penetrate these markets 
ram re 
equity in earnings from ram re was million in compared to million in this decrease was due primarily to unrealized losses in certain credit derivatives and increases in operating expenses 
hurricane katrina 
at december   fgic insured public finance obligations with a net par in force of approximately billion in counties or locations impacted by hurricane katrina 
approximately billion of this amount relates to areas designated by the federal emergency management agency fema as eligible for both public and individual assistance fema dual designated locations  the remainder relates to locations designated by fema as eligible for individual assistance only 
after evaluation  fgic placed obligations with a net par in force totaling million on its credit watchlist 
at december   fgic had case reserves of million  watchlist reserves of million and an estimated reinsurance recoverable of million 
fgic s loss reserve will likely be adjusted in the future as additional information becomes available 
any such adjustments may have a material impact on its results of operations and our equity in earnings from fgic 
ram re s exposure to obligations in the fema dual designated areas is approximately million 
ram re has not recorded reserves related to hurricane katrina 
we cannot predict whether fgic or ram re will ultimately incur losses or will record additional reserves in the future as a result of hurricane katrina 
other 
factors affecting the financial performance of our other segment include sps 
in october  we sold our interest in sps to credit suisse first boston usa  inc  or csfb 
we received cash payments of approximately million for our holdings in sps and a million repayment of a related party receivable 
we expect to receive additional monthly cash payments through the first quarter of from a residual interest in mortgage servicing assets 
our equity investment in sps generated losses of million in compared to equity in earnings of million in we recorded million after tax of sps related losses in due to a million reserve recorded by sps relating to expected katrina related losses on force placed hazard and flood reinsurance 
additional hurricane related reserve increases or losses by sps in the future could reduce the monthly payments we expect to receive in connection with the sale of our interest in sps 
contract underwriting services 
due to a decline in customers requests for contract underwriting services  our contract underwriting activities and associated revenues decreased in compared to we believe our contract underwriting activities and revenues will continue to decline in the future 
total contract underwriting expenses primarily include allocated expenses as well as monetary remedies provided to customers in the event we failed to properly underwrite a loan 
contract underwriting remedy expenses  and accruals thereof  increased from million in  to million in we believe these increases were driven by the high levels of contract underwriting activities in and other items affecting this segment 
our other segment also includes net investment income from our holding company  expenses related to corporate overhead  including employee compensation expense not included in us mortgage insurance operations  interest expense and  in the first quarter of  the net income from discontinued operations and the gain on the sale of aptic

these increases in and the realized gain on sale were partially offset by higher losses and lae and other underwriting and operating expenses in  primarily from us mortgage insurance operations  and the realized capital loss on our equity investment in sps in the increases in consolidated premiums earned in over  and over  were due to increases in premiums earned by us mortgage insurance operations and international operations 
us mortgage insurance operations premiums earned increased primarily as a result of higher average premium rates and the recognition of premiums associated with loan cancellations under non refundable  single and annual premium policies 
pmi australia s premiums earned increased as a result of growth in its business and the continued weakening of the us dollar relative to the australian dollar 
in  pmi europe s premiums earned increased by approximately million compared to primarily as a result of its acquisition of the r sa mortgage insurance portfolio in the fourth quarter of the increase in net investment income in over was due primarily to growth in our australian and european investment portfolios  combined with an increase in our consolidated book yield

in september  we sold our ownership interests in truman capital founders  llc and truman capital advisors  llc  collectively referred to as truman  and incurred a million capital loss which was included in net realized investment gains and losses 
in january  we signed a summary of terms with csfb  pursuant to which csfb received an option to acquire of our outstanding stock of sps 
as a result of the transaction  for the fourth quarter of we recorded a pre tax realized capital loss on equity investment held for sale sps of million  or million after tax 
in october  we sold our interest in sps to csfb and received cash payments of approximately million 
simultaneously with the sale  we received a million repayment of a related party receivable 
the decreases in other income in compared to  and compared to  were largely attributable to lower fees generated by our contract underwriting operations 
contract underwriting fees decreased in and primarily due to declines in customer requests for our contract underwriting services and lower levels of mortgage refinance activity in the results of our contract underwriting operations are included in our other segment 
the increases in our losses and lae in over  and over  were due primarily to higher claims paid in our us mortgage insurance operations 
us mortgage insurance operation s claims paid increased in and due to the seasoning of pmi s insurance portfolio  an increased number of claims paid in that were previously delayed by bankruptcy protection  and higher claim rates associated with the 
table of contents portion of pmi s portfolio that contains arms  high ltv  alt a  and less than a quality loans 
the increase in us mortgage insurance operations losses and lae  of which claims paid are a part  was partially offset by the addition of million to us mortgage insurance operation s net loss reserves in compared to million in the increase in other underwriting and operating expenses in over was due primarily to higher operating expenses in our international operations 
this increase was driven by higher pmi europe profit sharing commission accruals and increases in expenses related to payroll and regulatory compliance at pmi australia 
the increase in other underwriting and operating expenses in over was due primarily to higher operating expenses in our us mortgage insurance operations  including recognition of expenses previously deferred as acquisition costs  additional compensation related expenses and expenses related to pmi s field operations restructuring 
the decrease in interest expense and distributions on mandatorily redeemable preferred securities in compared to was due to the capitalization of interest expenses related to internally developed software 
the increase in interest expense in compared to was due to the inclusion of a full year s interest expense on the equity units we issued in november our income tax expense from continuing operations in increased by compared to primarily as a result of an increase in pre tax income from continuing operations  and an increase in the effective tax rate to from 
the increase in our effective tax rate was due primarily to an increase in our us mortgage insurance operations net income  excluding net investment income and equity in earnings  which is taxed at an effective tax rate of 
the increase was also due to reduced proportionate contributions to our consolidated financial results of municipal bond interest income  which has a lower effective tax rate 
the decrease in our income tax expense from continuing operations in compared to was primarily driven by the increased proportion of our consolidated net income from fgic which has a lower tax rate and the reversal in of a previously established tax contingency related to a state tax legislation matter 
in october  we entered into an agreement to sell our title insurance operations  aptic  for million in cash 
in accordance with accounting guidance  the results of operations for aptic were classified as discontinued operations beginning in the fourth quarter of in  we recognized an after tax realized gain of million relating to the sale of aptic on march  no results related to aptic have been recorded in the consolidated statements of operations for the last three quarters of we recognized an extraordinary after tax gain of million in  which was our share of negative goodwill recognized by fgic resulting from the application of purchase accounting adjustments upon our acquisition of our interest in fgic

these decreases in gross and net premiums written in compared to were partially offset by an increase in pmi s average premium rate in caused by higher percentages of polices with deeper coverage and policies on arms and high ltv loans

as of december   of primary flow insurance in force and of flow risk in force were subject to captive reinsurance agreements  compared to and at december   respectively 
these increases are the result of a higher portion of new insurance written with customers with whom we have captive reinsurance agreements 
upon cancellation of certain insurance coverage  pmi refunds the portion of premiums that is unearned to the insured 
the higher amount of refunded premiums in was primarily due to high levels of policy cancellations in resulting from refinance activities see insurance and risk in force below

see critical accounting polices reserves for losses and lae 
we expect a significant majority of losses and lae on insured loans in pmi s current portfolio to occur between the second and fourth years after loan origination 
approximately of pmi s insurance in force at december  was written after january  we expect that the continuing impact of the seasoning of the and earlier book years on total losses and lae was greatest in  with some continued impact in at december   pmi s and earlier book years represented of pmi s primary insurance in force 
to the extent we continue to have high levels of pmi s insurance in force that are in  or approaching  their peak loss development years  total losses and lae may continue to increase 
in addition  higher concentrations of pmi s portfolio of alt a loans  arms and high ltv loans could cause losses and lae to increase 
changes in economic conditions  including mortgage interest rates  us unemployment  job creation  and home prices could significantly impact our estimates and  therefore  pmi s total losses and lae 
in addition  changes in economic conditions may not necessarily be reflected in pmi s loss development in the year in which such changes occur 
during the second quarter of  we assessed the reasonableness of our estimate of reserves for lae 
as a result of this assessment  we decreased pmi s lae reserves by approximately million and reduced the allocation of claim related expenses from operating expenses to lae 
pmi s case and incurred but not reported reserves were increased by approximately the same amount of the reduction to lae reserves according to our best estimate for loss reserves as of june  pmi s primary mortgage insurance master policies define default as the borrower s failure to pay when due an amount equal to the scheduled monthly mortgage payment under the terms of the mortgage 
generally  the master policies require an insured to notify pmi of a default no later than the last business day of the month following the month in which the borrower becomes three monthly payments in default 
for reporting and internal tracking purposes  we do not consider a loan to be in default until the borrower has missed two consecutive payments 
depending upon its scheduled payment date  a loan delinquent for two consecutive monthly payments could be reported to pmi between the st and the th day after the first missed payment

we do not believe the reporting enhancement will affect ultimate losses incurred related to our modified pool loans in default and  accordingly  the reporting enhancement did not affect our estimation of total losses and lae 
the increases in modified pool default rates were driven by the seasoning of the modified pool portfolio and decreases in the number of modified pool policies in force 
pmi believes that its modified pool insurance products risk reduction features  including a stated stop loss limit  exposure limits on each individual loan in the pool  and in some cases  deductibles  reduce pmi s potential for loss exposure on loans insured by those products 
total pool loans in default which includes modified and other pool products described below as of december   and were   and  respectively

in millions amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs other underwriting and operating expenses litigation settlement refund total underwriting and operating expenses policy acquisition costs incurred and deferred our policy acquisition costs are costs that are primarily related to our acquisition  underwriting and processing of new mortgage insurance policies  including contract underwriting and sales related activities 
to the extent that we are compensated by customers for contract underwriting  those underwriting costs are not deferred 
we defer policy acquisition costs when incurred and amortize these costs in proportion to estimated gross profits for each policy year by type of insurance contract ie monthly  annual and single premium 
policy acquisition costs incurred and deferred are variable and fluctuate with the volume of new insurance applications processed and niw  and can also be reduced by increased use of pmi s electronic origination and delivery methods 
the decreases in policy acquisition costs incurred and deferred in and were primarily the result of lower levels of niw 
pmi s deferred policy acquisition cost asset decreased by million from december  to million at december  due to the continued amortization of policies originated in  a decline in niw compared to prior periods and expense savings realized from the field restructuring

in millions primary niw primary niw flow channel primary niw structured channel total primary niw the decrease in pmi s primary niw in was driven by a decrease in the size of the flow private mortgage insurance market  partially offset by increased opportunities for structured transactions 
we believe the size of the flow private mortgage insurance market was negatively impacted in through by lenders continued use of alternative mortgage products which do not require mortgage insurance and an increase in the level of loans originated and sold to non agency investors as a percentage of the total origination market 
pmi s niw has also been negatively affected by higher concentrations of loans in the market of a type or credit quality that pmi has traditionally not insured to a great extent 
modified pool insurance pmi currently offers modified pool insurance products that may be attractive to investors and lenders seeking a reduction of default risk beyond the protection provided by existing primary insurance or with respect to loans that do not require primary insurance  or for capital relief purposes

in millions  except percentages primary insurance in force primary risk in force pool risk in force policy cancellations primary year to date persistency primary pps pps the decrease in primary insurance in force in was due to continued high levels of policy cancellations and lower niw 
primary risk in force at december  remained flat compared to december  due to a greater number of high ltv loans with deeper coverage and higher average loan balances in compared to continued low mortgage interest rates and high levels of home price appreciation have driven high levels of policy cancellations and low persistency in  and the primary persistency rate is based on the percentage of primary insurance in force at the beginning of a month period that remains in force at the end of that period 
the increase in the persistency rate in was primarily the result of the stabilization of interest rates during and a corresponding decrease in refinancing activities 
credit and portfolio characteristics pmi insures less than a quality loans and alt a loans through all of its acquisition channels 
pmi defines less than a quality loans to include loans with credit scores generally less than pmi considers a loan alt a if it has a credit score of or greater and has certain characteristics such as reduced documentation verifying the borrower s income  assets  deposit information  and or employment

pmi s niw and primary risk in force also contained higher percentages of interest only loans and payment option arms 
we believe that these increases reflect the higher concentrations of these types of loans in the mortgage origination and private mortgage insurance markets 
the higher concentration of high ltv loans is  to a lesser extent  also the result of the expansion of underwriting guidelines by lenders  the gses and pmi pursuant to market outreach efforts and changes in a number of state statutes and regulations to permit the issuance of mortgage insurance on such loans 
we believe that these market trends may continue in we expect higher default rates and claim payment rates for less than a quality loans  alt a loans  arms  high ltv loans  interest only loans  and payment option arms than our traditional primary portfolio and incorporate these assumptions into our underwriting approach  portfolio limits  pricing and loss and claim estimates 
in  pmi s average premium rate generally increased principally as a result of pmi s primary portfolio consisting of higher percentages of these types of loans 
pmi also insures less than a quality loans  alt a loans  arms  interest only loans  payment option arms  and high ltv loans through its modified pool products 
we believe that the structure of pmi s modified pool products mitigates the risk of loss to pmi from the loans insured by those products
