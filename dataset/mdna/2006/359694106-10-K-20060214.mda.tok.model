item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview when reviewing the company s operating results it is important to understand how key external factors impact the company s financial results 
these factors include  the price changes of crude oil and natural gas  global supply and demand for raw materials  economic growth rates  especially in north america and europe  and currency exchange rates 
throughout  the key issue for the company was the rapid increase in the costs of raw materials 
many of the company s raw materials are petroleum based derivatives and are therefore subject to the fluctuations in the commodity prices 
in addition to the impact from energy prices  raw material supply and demand issues have an even larger impact on the company s cost increases 
as global demand has increased  especially from high growth regions  such as the asia pacific region  supplies became tight and certain raw materials were put on allocation beginning in the second half of the hurricanes in the us in august and september of made the situation even more challenging as the manufacturing capacity of some of the company s key raw materials was reduced 
the company was able to meet all of its customers demands in with approximately percent of its cost of sales accounted for by raw materials and containers  the company s financial results are extremely sensitive to changing costs in this area 
managing selling prices in this environment is critical to the financial success of the company 
in  the company generated percent of its revenue in north america and percent in europe 
the pace of economic growth in these regions has a direct impact on the revenues of certain business units in the company 
within the global adhesives operating segment  the revenues of the assembly  automotive and certain areas of the converting business units are especially sensitive to the economic growth rates 
customers of the assembly business include manufacturers of furniture  appliances and other durable goods that are sensitive to the fluctuations in economic activity 
the areas within the converting business unit that are sensitive to the economic growth include companies that produce packaging materials such as corrugated boxes  which are in lower demand as economic activity slows down 
other business units within global adhesives are not as susceptible to fluctuations in economic growth  such as the nonwoven business and packaging market within the converting business unit 
nonwoven customers are primarily manufacturers of personal hygiene products and a high percentage of the packaging customers are in the food and beverage industry 
in the full valu specialty operating segment the powder coatings business  which sells to manufacturers of office equipment  lawn and garden equipment and other products made with metals is the most sensitive to overall economic growth rates 
the windows business unit and ceramic tile installation product line  both within the full valu specialty segment  are sensitive to more specific economic indicators such as housing starts and other construction related activity in the us the movement of foreign currency exchange rates impacts the translation of the foreign entities financial statements into us dollars 
as the foreign currencies strengthen against the us dollar  the company s revenues and costs become higher as the foreign currency denominated transactions translate into more us dollars 
the fluctuations in the euro against the us dollar have the largest impact on the company s financial results compared to all other currencies 
the currency fluctuations did not have as large of an impact on the results as they did in and  but the percent net revenue increase in as compared to did represent an increase of million 
this followed a net revenue increase of million  or percent  in as compared to from a financial performance standpoint  was an excellent year for the company 
diluted earnings per share increased to in from in and in many of the reasons for the increase are 
table of contents discussed below in the results of operations  but the two overriding reasons were successful average selling price increases and improved cost structures through the utilization of the lean six sigma sm methodology 
cash flow generation also showed excellent improvement in free cash flow  defined as net cash provided from operating activities  less cash outlays for capital expenditures and dividends  was million in  million in and million in management believes that free cash flow is more useful to shareholders as an indicator of cash flow generation than cash flow from operating activities because it provides more insight into the company s ability to fund such things as debt reduction and acquisitions 
the company s fiscal year ends on the saturday closest to november once in every five or six years  the fiscal year is weeks instead of fiscal was a week year 
the extra week added an estimated million of net revenue  million of net income and to earnings per share in as compared to during the second quarter of  the company completed its definitive agreements to enter into business related partnerships in japan and china with sekisui chemical co  ltd 
in japan  sekisui and hb fuller merged their japanese adhesives businesses on april  to create sekisui fuller company  ltd  of which hb fuller owns percent 
the company also has an option to purchase an additional percent in for million 
with respect to china  the company received million from sekisui in exchange for a percent investment in the company s china entities and an option for sekisui to purchase an additional percent in for million 
as a result of the percent investment sold  the company recorded a pretax gain of million 
critical accounting policies and significant estimates management s discussion and analysis of its results of operations and financial condition are based upon consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management believes the critical accounting policies and areas that require the most significant judgments and estimates to be used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are pension and other postretirement plan assumptions  goodwill recoverability  product  environmental and other litigation liabilities  and income tax accounting 
pension and other postretirement plan assumptions the company sponsors defined benefit pension plans in both us and foreign entities 
also in the us the company sponsors other postretirement plans for health care and life insurance costs 
expenses and liabilities for the pension plans and other postretirement plans are actuarially calculated 
these calculations are based on management s assumptions related to the discount rate  expected return on assets  projected salary increases and healthcare cost trend rates 
the annual measurement date for these assumptions is august note to the consolidated financial statements includes disclosure of these assumptions for both the non us and non us plans 
the discount rate assumption is tied to a long term high quality bond index and is therefore subject to annual fluctuations 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of the pension obligations  which results in higher pension expense 
the discount rate in the us was percent at august  as compared to percent at august  and percent at august  a discount rate reduction of percentage points increases pension and other postretirement plan expense pretax approximately million 
discount rates for non us plans are determined in a manner consistent with the us plan 
the expected return on assets assumption on the investment portfolios for the pension and other postretirement benefit plans is based on the long term expected returns for the investment mix of assets currently in the portfolio 
because the rate of return is a long term assumption  it generally does not change each year 
management uses historic return trends of the asset portfolio combined with recent market conditions to estimate the future rate of return 
the current investment mix in the us portfolios is nearly percent in us equities 

table of contents the company has used an expected return on assets assumption for the us portfolio of percent since this rate was used in calculating the expenses for  and and will also be used for a change of percentage points for the expected return assumption will impact us net pension and other postretirement plan expense pretax by approximately million 
expected return on asset assumptions for non us plans are determined in a manner consistent with the us plan 
the projected salary increase assumption is based on historic trends and comparisons to the external market 
higher rates of increase result in higher pension expenses 
as this rate is also a long term expected rate  it is less likely to change on an annual basis 
in the us  management has used the rate of percent for the past three years 
goodwill goodwill is the excess of cost of an acquired entity over the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a purchase business combination 
as of december   the company s balance sheet included approximately million of goodwill 
the goodwill is primarily included in the global adhesives operating segment 
sfas no 
requires the company to test goodwill for impairment annually or more often if circumstances or events indicate a change in the impairment status 
impairment testing compares the fair value of the reporting units that contain the goodwill to the net asset carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if impairment exists 
the calculations confirmed that the fair value of the reporting units exceeded the net asset carrying values for all reporting units 
management judgment is required in calculating the fair value of the reporting units 
the calculation uses a discounted cash flow analysis that requires management to project financial performance and related cash flows 
the projections are based on management s best estimate given recent financial performance  market trends  strategic plans and other available information 
future results will most likely differ from the projected results 
however  based on the margin that fair value exceeded the net asset carrying value of the various reporting units  management does not anticipate a material impact on the company s financial results from differences in these assumptions 
product  environmental and other litigation liabilities as disclosed in item and in note and note to the consolidated financial statements  the company is subject to various claims  lawsuits and other legal proceedings 
accruals for loss contingencies associated with these matters are made when it is determined that a liability is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
the assessment of the probable liabilities is based on the facts and circumstances known at the time that the financial statements are being prepared 
for cases in which it is determined that a liability has been incurred but only a range for the potential loss exists  the minimum amount of the range is recorded and subsequently adjusted  as better information becomes available 
for cases in which insurance coverage is available  the gross amount of the estimated liabilities is accrued and a receivable is recorded for any probable estimated insurance recoveries 
the company has recorded million for environmental investigation and remediation liabilities  including million for environmental remediation and monitoring activities at its sorocaba  brazil facility 
in the eifs litigation involving primarily single family homes  million for the potential liabilities and million for potential insurance recoveries were accrued 
the company also has accrued million for potential liabilities and million for potential insurance recoveries related to asbestos litigation 
a complete discussion of environmental  product and other litigation liabilities is disclosed in item and note to the consolidated financial statements 
based upon currently available facts  management does not believe that the ultimate resolution of any pending legal proceeding  individually or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on the company s long term financial condition 
however  adverse developments could negatively impact the company s results of operations or cash flows in one or more future quarters 

table of contents income tax accounting as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  management is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
the process involves estimating actual current tax expense along with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for book and tax purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the consolidated balance sheet 
management records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
management has considered future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
increases in the valuation allowance result in additional expense to be reflected within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of income 
at december   the valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets totaled million 
results of operations compared to and net revenue net revenue in of  million increased million or percent from the net revenue of  million 
the net revenue was million or percent above the net revenue of  million in management reviews variances in net revenue in terms of changes related to product pricing  sales volume  acquisitions divestitures and changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the following table shows the net revenue variance analysis for the past two years decrease vs vs product pricing sales volume acquisitions divestitures currency total the extra week in contributed approximately percentage points of the net revenue increase as compared to and it was primarily related to volume 
significant increases in average selling prices in were achieved in both the global adhesives and full valu specialty operating segments as compared to the sales volume growth of in was primarily due to increased global economic activity in as compared to the net revenue increases attributed to currency in both and were mainly caused by the fluctuations of the euro against the us dollar 
in the global adhesives operating segment net revenue increased by percent in as compared to average selling price increases of percent were partially offset by a percent decrease related to acquisitions and divestitures 
sales volume was essentially flat with  however  the figure includes the volume associated with the rd week of percent 
currency had a positive percent effect on the net revenue as compared to in  net revenue in global adhesives increased percent from the net revenue achieved in included in the global adhesives net revenue growth were increases attributed to volume of percent  positive effects from currency fluctuations of percent and increases resulting from the probos acquisition of percent 
average selling prices decreased percent in as compared to the full valu specialty operating segment had net revenue growth in of percent as compared to average selling price increases accounted for a percent increase in net revenue in and sales volume accounted for a percent increase  which includes the impact of the extra week in of percent

table of contents percent to the cost of sales increase as compared to the amount was percent higher than the cost of sales recorded in as a percentage of net revenue  the cost of sales was percent in  percent in and percent in raw material cost increases were the predominant reason for the cost of sales increase in as compared to the increases were felt in both global adhesives and full valu specialty as energy prices increased throughout the year in response to higher demand combined with interruptions in supply 
supply interruptions were exacerbated by the hurricanes in the united states in august and september of another effect caused by the rising energy costs was a significant increase in the company s delivery expenses in as compared to the increases in raw materials and delivery costs were mitigated somewhat by reduced costs and improved efficiencies resulting from the company s lean six sigma sm lss initiatives and overall cost controls in the manufacturing areas 
rising raw material costs in  especially in the second half of the year  were also a key reason for the percent cost of sales increase in as compared to another factor  however  in the increase was the effect from currency rate fluctuations 
currency had an estimated impact of increasing the cost of sales by million as compared to cost reductions associated with the first wave of lss projects partially offset the cost of sales increases that resulted from raw material costs and currency effects 
gross profit margin the gross profit margin was percent in and in the gross profit margin was percent 
the key to maintaining the gross profit margin in at the level of percent was the implementation of selling price increases to offset the effects of rapidly rising raw material costs 
the main reason for the reduced margin in as compared to was that the pace of raw material cost increases exceeded the pace of the company s selling price increases to its customers 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses sg a expenses were million in  million in and million in the extra week in added over million to the sg a expenses

outlook raw material prices have continued to increase into the first quarter of management s expectation is that these costs will continue to increase throughout the year  although possibly at a lower rate than in and selling price increases will again be a critical factor in the company s ability to maintain and restore its gross profit margin 
sales volume  excluding the extra week  decreased in as the company took an aggressive position on raising selling prices 
much of the lost volume was due to management s commitment to maintain profitability and willingness to let unprofitable volume go to the competition 
by january  many competitors had followed along in raising prices as they realized that this environment of rising raw material costs was not going to abate in the near term 
as a result  management expects volume losses to be reduced in as compared to the positive effects on the company s cost structures from utilizing lean six sigma sm are expected to continue in as projects completed in will yield full year benefits in benefits will be realized in both the manufacturing operations and the sg a expense areas 
beginning in  the company will expense stock options directly to the income statement in accordance with sfas no 
r 
this is expected to reduce the earnings per share by approximately 
another area of cost increase in will be pension expense  which is expected to increase over million in as compared to the primary reason for the expense increase is the lower interest rates that are used to calculate the plan liabilities 
lower interest rates result in higher liabilities  which leads to higher expense on the income statement 
an offset to the expense increases noted above will be a decrease in depreciation expense in as compared to certain information technology assets became fully depreciated at the end of the depreciation expenses are expected to be to million less than the company s balance sheet as of december  was strong with over million in cash and cash equivalents and only million in total debt 
the strong balance sheet positions the company with borrowing capacity to support a significant level of merger and acquisition activity 
management continuously evaluates potential opportunities 
on january  the company entered into an asset purchase agreement with roanoke companies group  inc under which a subsidiary of the company will acquire substantially all the assets of roanoke see note to consolidated financial statements 
the purchase price is expected to be million plus additional consideration of up to million over a two year period based on the attainment of certain profitability thresholds 
the transaction is expected to close during the second quarter of the company s fiscal year 
in  management expects the transaction to have a slight negative impact on diluted earnings per share

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the company is exposed to various market risks  including changes in interest rates  foreign currency rates and prices of raw materials 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk exposure to changes in interest rates result primarily from borrowing activities used to fund operations 
committed floating rate credit facilities are used to fund a portion of operations 
management believes that probable near term changes in interest rates would not materially affect the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the annual impact on the results of operations of a one percentage point interest rate change on the outstanding balance of its variable rate debt as of december  would be approximately million 
foreign exchange risk as a result of being a global enterprise  there is exposure to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  which may adversely affect operating results and financial position 
approximately percent of net revenue is generated outside of the united states 
principal foreign currency exposures relate to the euro  british pound sterling  japanese yen  australian dollar  canadian dollar  argentine peso  brazilian real and chinese renminbi 

table of contents management s objective is to balance  where possible  local currency denominated assets to local currency denominated liabilities to have a natural hedge and minimize foreign exchange impacts 
the company enters into cross border transactions through importing and exporting goods to and from different countries and locations 
these transactions generate foreign exchange risk as they create assets  liabilities and cash flows in currencies other than the local currency 
this also applies to services provided and other cross border agreements among subsidiaries 
management takes steps to minimize risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations through normal operating and financing activities and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative instruments 
during  additional processes were implemented in an effort to further minimize foreign exchange exposure 
management does not enter into any speculative positions with regard to derivative instruments 
note and note to the consolidated financial statements provide additional details regarding the management of foreign exchange risk 
from a sensitivity analysis viewpoint  based on financial results  a hypothetical overall percent change in the us dollar would have resulted in a change of approximately million in net income or per diluted share 
raw materials the principal raw materials used to manufacture products include resins  polymers  synthetic rubbers  vinyl acetate monomer and plasticizers 
the company generally avoids sole source supplier arrangements for raw materials 
while alternate supplies of most key raw materials are available  sustained strong economical growth in north america and china coupled with unplanned supplier production outages have led to strained supply demand situations for several key feedstocks such as ethylene and propylene  some of their derivatives  several polymers and other petroleum derivatives such as waxes 
in  the single largest expenditure was the purchase of raw materials 
management s objective is to purchase raw materials that meet both its quality standards and production needs at the lowest total cost 
most raw materials are purchased on the open market or under contracts that limit the frequency but not the magnitude of price increases 
in some cases  however  the risk of raw material price changes is managed by strategic sourcing agreements which limit price increases to increases in supplier feedstock costs  while requiring decreases as feedstock costs decline 
the leverage of having substitute raw materials approved for use wherever possible is used to minimize the impact of possible price increases
