overview with the convergence of it and business  technology has become increasingly more important not just to technology professionals  but also to business executives 
we are an independent and objective research and advisory firm that helps it and business executives use technology to build  guide and grow their enterprises 
we employ a diversified business model that leverages the breadth and depth of our research intellectual capital while enabling us to maintain and grow our market leading position and brand franchise 
our strategy is to align our resources and our infrastructure to leverage that intellectual capital into additional revenue streams through effective packaging  campaigning and cross selling of our products and services 
our diversified business model provides multiple entry points and synergies that facilitate increased client spending on our research  consulting and events 
a key strategy is to increase business volume with our most valuable clients  identifying relationships with the greatest sales potential and expanding those relationships by offering strategically relevant research and analysis 
we intend to maintain a balance between pursuing opportunities and applying resources with a strict focus on growing our three core businesses and generating profitability through a streamlined cost structure 
we have three business segments research  consulting and events 
research provides research content and advice for it professionals  technology companies and the investment community in the form of reports and briefings  as well as peer networking services and membership programs designed specifically for cios and other senior executives 
consulting consists primarily of consulting  measurement engagements and strategic advisory services paid one day analyst engagements sas  which provide assessments of cost  performance  efficiency and quality focused on the it industry 
events consists of various symposia  conferences and exhibitions focused on the it industry 
we believe the following business measurements are important performance indicators for our business segments business segment business measurements research contract value represents the value attributable to all of our subscription related research products that recognize revenue on a ratable basis 
contract value is calculated as the annualized value of all subscription research contracts in effect at a specific point in time  without regard to the duration of the contract 
client retention rate represents a measure of client satisfaction and renewed business relationships at a specific point in time 
client retention is calculated on a percentage basis by dividing our current clients  who were also clients a year ago  by all clients from a year ago 
wallet retention rate represents a measure of the amount of contract value we have retained with clients over a twelve month period 
wallet retention is calculated on a percentage basis by dividing the contract value 
table of contents business segment business measurements of clients  who were clients one year earlier  by the total contract value from a year earlier 
when wallet retention exceeds client retention  it is an indication of retention of higher spending clients  or increased spending by retained clients  or both 
number of executive program members represents the number of paid participants in executive programs 
consulting consulting backlog represents future revenue to be derived from in process consulting  measurement and strategic advisory services engagements 
utilization rates represent a measure of productivity of our consultants 
utilization rates are calculated for billable headcount on a percentage basis by dividing total hours billed by total hours available to bill 
billing rate represents earned billable revenue divided by total billable hours 
average annualized revenue per billable headcount represents a measure of the revenue generating ability of an average billable consultant and is calculated periodically by multiplying the average billing rate per hour times the average utilization percentage times the billable hours available for one year 
events number of events represents the total number of hosted events completed during the period 
number of attendees represents the number of people who attend events 
executive summary of operations and financial position during calendar  we acquired meta group  inc meta in an all cash transaction for per share  or approximately million  excluding transaction costs of million 
meta was a publicly owned  premier information technology and research firm that was based in stamford  connecticut with about employees 
in  meta generated million in revenue from worldwide locations and had million of assets at december  the results of operations of meta are included in our consolidated financial results beginning april   the date of the acquisition 
as of december  we have fully and successfully integrated meta into our operations 
we initiated and completed several actions during calendar to enhance shareholder value 
we simplified our capital structure by eliminating our dual class stock  and since july th our common stock has been trading under one ticker symbol it 
we believe this change increased the trading liquidity of our common stock for our shareholders 
in september we completed a buy back of certain vested and outstanding stock options for cash  which resulted in the tender and cancellation of approximately million options 
we undertook the buy back to reduce the option overhang resulting from the high number of options outstanding 
in october our board of directors authorized a million common share repurchase program  and we repurchased approximately  of our common shares by the end of the year 
we enhanced our liquidity and financial flexibility during calendar by amending our credit agreement 
in addition to increasing our available credit and securing a more favorable amortization schedule  we also obtained more favorable covenant terms 
we also reduced our exposure to rising interest rates on the term portion of the loan facility by entering into an interest rate swap agreement in the fourth quarter of calendar  which effectively converted the base floating rate on the base term loan to a fixed rate 
we ended calendar with million in cash  which we believe is sufficient to meet our current needs  and our stockholders equity at december  was million 
we believe that we have stabilized our core research business and will continue to focus on growing its revenues 
research revenue was up over the prior year  to million  revenue was up about excluding the impact of meta and the effect of foreign currency 
at december   contract value was million  up  or million  from million at december  this represents our highest contract value since september  and our second highest level ever 
in addition  the growth in contract value shows increases across all regions as well as across the entire product portfolio 
our research client retention rate at december  increased to from at the prior year end  while wallet retention was down to from over the same period 
consulting revenue for calendar was up over the prior year revenue was up excluding meta and foreign currency impact  and we ended calendar with a backlog of million  a increase from december  during calendar  our average consultant utilization rate was  compared to in the prior year  while billable headcount increased to at december   compared to at december  our average annualized revenue per billable headcount was above  our events business continues to deliver consistent and profitable growth 
our emphasis on managing the events portfolio to retain our long time successful events and introduce promising new events has resulted in continued positive revenue performance  with calendar revenue up over the prior year 
same event revenue also increased  up over the prior year 
contributing to the increased 
table of contents revenue was a substantial increase in the number of events  with held during calendar as compared to held in calendar fluctuations in quarterly operating results our quarterly and annual revenue  operating income  and cash flow fluctuate as a result of many factors  including the timing of symposia  our flagship event that normally occurs during the fourth calendar quarter  and other events  the amount of new business generated  the mix of domestic and international business  changes in market demand for our products and services  changes in foreign currency rates  the timing of the development  introduction and marketing of new products and services  and competition in the industry 
the potential fluctuations in our operating income could cause period to period comparisons of operating results not to be meaningful and could provide an unreliable indication of future operating results 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements requires the application of appropriate accounting policies 
our significant accounting policies are described in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
management considers the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application requires complex and subjective judgments and estimates 
specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described below 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  and sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab 
revenue by significant source is accounted for as follows research revenues are derived from subscription contracts for research products 
revenues from research products are deferred and recognized ratably over the applicable contract term  consulting revenues are generated from fixed fee and time and material engagements 
revenue from fixed fee contracts is recognized on a percentage of completion basis 
revenues from time and materials engagements is recognized as work is delivered and or services are provided  events revenues are deferred and recognized upon the completion of the related symposium  conference or exhibition  other revenues consists primarily of fees from research reprints and software licensing 
reprint fees are recognized when the reprint is shipped 
fees from software licensing is recognized when a signed non cancelable software license exists  delivery has occurred  collection is probable  and the fees are fixed or determinable  and the majority of research contracts are billable upon signing  absent special terms granted on a limited basis from time to time 
all research contracts are non cancelable and non refundable  except for government contracts that have a day cancellation clause  but have not produced material cancellations to date 
it is our policy to record the entire amount of the contract that is billable as a fee receivable at the time the contract is signed with a corresponding amount as deferred revenue  since the contract represents a legally enforceable claim 
for those government contracts that permit termination  we bill the client the full amount billable under the contract but only record a receivable equal to the earned portion of the contract 
in addition  we only record deferred revenue on these government contracts when cash is received 
deferred revenues attributable to government contracts were million and million at december  and december   respectively 
in addition  at december  and december   we had not recognized uncollected receivables or deferred revenues  relating to government contracts that permit termination  of million and million  respectively 
the preliminary purchase price allocation of the meta acquisition includes an estimate of the fair value of the cost to fulfill the deferred revenue obligation assumed from meta 
the estimated fair value of the deferred revenue obligation was determined by estimating the costs to provide the services plus a normal profit margin  and did not include any costs associated with selling efforts 
as a result  in allocating the purchase price we recorded adjustments to reduce the carrying value of meta s march  deferred revenue by approximately million 
consequently  revenues related to meta contracts existing at the date of acquisition in the amount of approximately million that would have been recorded by meta had it remained an independent entity were not recognized in calendar  and the remaining million will impact calendar as former meta customers renew their contracts  we will recognize the full value of revenue from those new contracts over the respective contract periods 
uncollectible fees receivable the allowance for losses is composed of a bad debt and a sales and allowance reserve 
provisions are charged against earnings 
the measurement of likely and probable losses and the allowance for uncollectible fees receivable is based on historical loss experience  aging of outstanding receivables  an assessment of current economic conditions and the financial health of specific clients 
this evaluation is inherently judgmental and requires material estimates 
these valuation reserves are periodically re evaluated and adjusted as more information about the ultimate collectibility of fees receivable becomes available 
circumstances that could cause our valuation reserves to increase include changes in our clients liquidity and credit quality  other factors negatively impacting our clients ability to pay their obligations as they come due  and the effectiveness of our collection efforts 
the following table provides our total fees receivable  along with the related allowance for losses in thousands december  total fees receivable allowance for losses fees receivable  net 
table of contents impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets the evaluation of goodwill is performed in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
among other requirements  this standard eliminated goodwill amortization upon adoption and requires ongoing annual assessments of goodwill impairment 
the evaluation of other intangible assets is performed on a periodic basis 
these assessments require management to estimate the fair values of our reporting units based on estimates of future business operations and market and economic conditions in developing long term forecasts 
if we determine that the fair value of any reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  we must recognize an impairment charge  for the associated goodwill of that reporting unit  to earnings in our financial statements 
goodwill is evaluated for impairment at least annually  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important that could trigger a review for impairment include the following significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
due to the numerous variables associated with our judgments and assumptions relating to the valuation of the reporting units and the effects of changes in circumstances affecting these valuations  both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates are subject to uncertainty  and as additional information becomes known  we may change our estimates 
during calendar  we recorded an impairment charge of million in the first quarter relating to goodwill associated with certain operations in south america that were closed  and in the fourth quarter we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million related to the exit from certain non core product lines 
accounting for income taxes as we prepare our consolidated financial statements  we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate 
this process involves estimating our current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheets 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets when future realization is in question 
we consider the availability of loss carryforwards  existing deferred tax liabilities  future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
in the event we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged against income in the period such determination was made 
we operate in numerous foreign taxing jurisdictions and our level of operations or profitability in each jurisdiction could have an impact upon the amount of income taxes that we provide in any given year 
in addition  our tax filings for various tax years are subject to audit by the tax authorities in jurisdictions where we conduct business 
these audits may result in assessments of additional taxes 
we have provided for the amounts we believe will ultimately result from these audits 
however  resolution of these matters involves uncertainties and there are no assurances that the ultimate resolution will not exceed the amounts provided 
in october we received an irs examination report showing proposed changes that primarily relate to the valuation of intangible assets licensed to a foreign subsidiary and the calculation of payments under a cost sharing arrangement 
see item legal proceedings for additional information 
contingencies and other loss reserves and accruals we record accruals for severance costs  lease costs associated with excess facilities  contract terminations and asset impairments as a result of actions we undertake to streamline our organization  reposition certain businesses and reduce ongoing costs 
estimates of costs to be incurred to complete these actions  such as future lease payments  sublease income  the fair value of assets  and severance and related benefits  are based on assumptions at the time the actions are initiated 
to the extent actual costs differ from those estimates  reserve levels may need to be adjusted 
in addition  these actions may be revised due to changes in business conditions that we did not foresee at the time such plans were approved 
during calendar we revised our previous estimate for costs and losses associated with excess facilities and we recorded a charge of approximately million  primarily due to a reduction of office space in san jose  california  where we consolidated employees from two buildings into one 
the charge is included in other charges along with severance  the option buyback  impairment  and other costs 
additionally  we record accruals for estimated incentive compensation costs during each year 
amounts accrued at the end of each reporting period are based on our estimates and may require adjustment as the ultimate amount paid for these incentives are sometimes not known until after year end 
change in fiscal year on october   we announced that our board of directors had approved a change of our fiscal year end from september to december  effective january  this change resulted in a three month transitional period ending december  references to transition  unless otherwise indicated  refer to the three month transitional period ended december  references to fiscal and fiscal  unless otherwise indicated  are to the respective fiscal year period from october through september references to calendar  calendar  calendar  calendar  and calendar  unless otherwise indicated  are to the

foreign currency translation 

table of contents provision for income taxes was and of income before income taxes for calendar and  respectively 
the increase in the effective tax rate for calendar  as compared to that of calendar  is principally due to the fact that the company generated less income in low tax jurisdictions as compared to the prior year and recorded valuation allowances against capital losses and foreign tax credit carryforwards 
the impact of these items is offset  in part  by benefits taken to reduce the overall tax expense on repatriated earnings as well as reductions for interest costs related to tax contingencies 
the impact of the various positive and negative adjustments is amplified by lower pretax book income in as compared to in calendar  we took a million tax charge in anticipation of repatriating approximately million in earnings from our non us subsidiaries in calendar the repatriation was expected to qualify for a one time reduced tax rate pursuant to the american jobs creation act 
ajca 
the charge was partially offset by a benefit of million to release valuation allowance on foreign tax credits that were expected to be utilized before they expired 
in march  we repatriated approximately million in cash from our non us subsidiaries 
also in  we took into account technical corrections issued by the treasury department related to repatriating earnings under the ajca 
as a result of favorable provisions in the technical corrections  we realized a tax benefit of million in that reduced the cumulative charge on the repatriated earnings to million 
in addition  as a consequence of the application of the technical corrections  we re evaluated our ability to use foreign tax credits in the future and took a charge of million to re establish valuation allowance for foreign tax credits that will more likely than not expire unused 
excluding the effect of certain one time charges  the provision for income taxes for calendar years ended and would have been and respectively

the impact of foreign currency was immaterial 
excluding the impact of meta and foreign currency  revenue was up 
research gross contribution of million for calendar increased from the million for calendar  while the gross contribution margin for calendar decreased to from in the prior year 
the decrease in the gross contribution margin in calendar was primarily due to increased revenues from our executive programs  which have lower margins than our core subscription products  an increase in compensation costs  mostly due to headcount related to the meta acquisition  and the impact of converting meta contract value to gartner contract value 
we have now transacted on approximately of the meta contract value 
research contract value  an indicator of future research revenue  was million at december   an increase of  or million  from million at december  approximately half of the increase in contract value is attributable to the meta acquisition

table of contents at december   our research client retention rate increased percentage point to from at december   while our wallet retention rate was compared to at december  our executive program membership was  at december   up from  at december   which is attributed to new business growth in north america and emea  as well as improved renewal rates and clients obtained as a result of the meta acquisition

consulting consulting revenues of million for calendar were up  or million  when compared to the million in calendar  with meta contributing approximately million of the revenue growth 
the revenue increase reflects strong organic growth in our core consulting services as well as in the performance fee portion of our consulting business 
the increase in the performance fee business for calendar includes revenues that the company did not expect to close until the first quarter of  and as a result our margin for that quarter will be impacted 
the growth in our core consulting services reflects our continuing execution of our strategy of focusing on fewer accounts  attracting larger deals through integrated solutions  and enhancing engagement profitability through improved resource management

excluding the impact of meta and foreign currency  revenue was up

events revenues increased  or million  to million for calendar  compared to million for calendar  with approximately million of the increase related to meta 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a negligible effect on revenues when comparing calendar to calendar excluding meta and foreign currency  revenue was up 
the revenue increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of events  to for calendar compared to in the prior year period  as we added new events in new topic areas and geographies 
revenue increased to a lesser extent due to continued performance from our recurring events  for which revenue was up about year over year 
the number of attendees at our events increased by about in calendar compared to calendar  rising to  from  respectively 
gross contribution of million for calendar was higher than the million recorded in calendar as a percentage of revenues  gross contribution was during calendar and calendar since new events typically run at lower margins in their first year of existence  the new events we launched in calendar had slightly lower margins than existing events 
however  in addition to launching these new events  we continued to rationalize our existing portfolio by exiting from events that no longer met our profit targets 
as a result of this active portfolio management  we were able to deliver a flat contribution margin year over year

we evaluated the investment for impairment because of the investee s recapitalization due to its lack of capital resources to redeem its mandatorily redeemable equity  which led us to write the investment down to our estimate of fair value 
the conversion of our outstanding convertible debt to equity during the fourth quarter of calendar decreased our interest expense 
however  due to the new credit agreement signed in the third quarter of calendar  interest expense will increase in the future 
other expense  net for calendar of million includes the non cash write off of million of accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments associated with certain of our operations in south america that we have closed

research gross contribution of million for calendar decreased slightly from the million for calendar  while gross contribution margin for calendar decreased to from in the prior year 
the decrease in the gross contribution margin in calendar was primarily due to increased revenues from our executive programs  which have lower margins than our core subscription products  as well as continued investment in our people  products  and processes required to provide research growth 
research contract value  an indicator of future research revenue  was million at december   an increase of from million at december   with roughly half of the increase due to the effects of foreign currency 
the research contract value of million at december  represented our highest reported contract value since the first quarter of calendar during this period  we focused on stabilizing and then growing revenue in our core research business

liquidity and capital resources calendar cash provided by operating activities totaled million for calendar  compared to million for the prior year  a million decline 
the net decrease in cash flow from operating activities was due primarily to the payment of million of meta integration payments  higher employee salary costs  primarily related to higher headcount due to the acquisition of meta  and to a lesser extent  a shift in the mix of our products in the research segment from higher margin core research to lower margin executive programs 
offsetting these decreases was a million reduction in bonus payments and a decline of approximately million in severance and related payments 
cash used in investing activities increased to million during calendar as compared to million in the prior year  primarily due to the acquisition of meta  which was completed on april  the company s net cash investment in meta was approximately million of cash paid  including transaction costs  less the million acquired from meta

we paid million in bonuses during compared to zero in calendar no bonuses were paid during calendar as they had previously been paid during the quarter ended december  but are now being paid during the first half of the year as a result of our change in fiscal year that became effective january  as a result  the bonuses were paid in calendar further  we paid a portion of our bonuses in the third quarter of calendar in accordance with the current year corporate bonus plan 
additionally  cash from operating activities declined because we paid approximately million more in severance during calendar than in calendar the net decrease in cash flow from operating activities was also due to the accelerated collection of receivables in calendar which improved operating cash flow in that year by approximately million  which was not repeated in calendar lastly  approximately million of certain accrued liabilities booked in the fourth quarter of calendar were paid in the first quarter of calendar cash used in investing activities increased to million during calendar as compared to million for calendar the increase was primarily due to million we prepaid related to the acquisition of meta

we repaid million of this debt in the fourth quarter of calendar at december   cash and cash equivalents totaled million

obligations and commitments the company has a million  unsecured five year credit agreement with a bank group led by jpmorgan chase bank consisting of a million term loan and a million revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility may be increased up to million 
as of december   there was million outstanding on the term loan and million outstanding on the revolving credit facility 
as of december   the company had approximately million borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility 
the term loan will be repaid in quarterly installments  with the final payment due on june  the revolving credit facility may be used for loans  and up to million may be used for letters of credit 
the revolving loans may be borrowed  repaid and reborrowed until june   at which time all amounts borrowed must be repaid 
the loans bear interest  at the company s option  at a rate equal to the greatest of the administrative agent s prime rate  the administrative agent s rate for three month certificates of deposit adjusted for statutory reserves and the average rate on overnight federal funds plus of plus a spread equal to between and 
table of contents depending on the company s leverage ratio as of the fiscal quarter most recently ended  or at the eurodollar rate adjusted for statutory reserves plus a spread equal to between and  depending on the company s leverage ratio as of the fiscal quarter most recently ended

it also contains events of default that include  among others  non payment of principal  interest or fees  inaccuracy of representations and warranties  violation of covenants  cross defaults to certain other indebtedness  bankruptcy and insolvency events  material judgments  and events constituting a change of control 
the occurrence of an event of default will increase the applicable rate of interest by and could result in the acceleration of gartner s obligations under the credit agreement and an obligation of any or all of the guarantors to pay the full amount of gartner s obligations under the credit agreement 
in december the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement to hedge the base interest rate risk on the term loan 
the effect of the swap is to convert the floating base rate on the term loan to a fixed rate 
under the swap terms  the company will pay a fixed rate and in return will receive a three month libor rate 
the three month libor rate received on the swap will match the base rate paid on the term loan since both use three month libor 
the swap had an initial notional value of million which will decline as payments are made on the term loan so that the amount outstanding under the term loan and the notional amount of the swap will always be equal 
the swap had a notional amount of million at december   which was the same as the outstanding amount of the term loan 
in october  the company s board of directors authorized a million common share repurchase program 
repurchases under the program will be made from time to time through open market purchases and or block trades 
repurchases are subject to the availability of our common stock  prevailing market conditions  the trading price of the company s common stock  and our financial performance 
the company intends to fund the repurchases from cash flow from operations but may also borrow under the company s existing credit agreement 
during the fourth quarter of calendar  the company repurchased  shares of its common stock under this program for a total purchase price of million  of which million was paid in early january when the related share repurchase transactions settled 
we believe that our existing cash balances  together with cash from our operating activities and the additional borrowing capacity under our amended five year revolving credit facility  will be sufficient for our expected short term and foreseeable long term needs 
the following table represents our contractual cash commitments at december  in millions  including contractual commitments related to the meta acquisition

recently issued accounting standards in june the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no

sfas no 
supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting changes  which previously required that most voluntary changes in accounting principle be recognized by including in the current period s net income the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle 
sfas no 
also makes a distinction between retrospective application of an accounting principle and the restatement of financial statements to reflect the correction of an error 
the statement is effective for accounting changes and error corrections made in fiscal years beginning after december  in december the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards r  share based payment sfas no 
r 
this statement replaces sfas no 
and apb and will require the recognition of expense for share based payments  to include the value of stock options and other equity awards granted to employees 
the revised statement was originally effective for periods beginning after june   with early adoption permitted 
on april  the sec issued a standard that amends the date of compliance with sfas no

under the sec amendment  sfas no 
r must be adopted beginning with the first interim or annual reporting period of the registrant s first fiscal year beginning on or after june  gartner adopted sfas no 
r on january   under the modified prospective method of adoption 
projecting the amount of future stock compensation expense is inherently difficult as it is dependent on the type and amount of future awards granted  and the volatility and price of our common stock on the date of grant 
the company is currently reviewing its stock compensation strategy and anticipates that it will make changes to the types of equity awards that it will grant in the future 
based on our current estimates  we project that the adoption of sfas r will result in million to million of pre tax expense in calendar  which will have a materially negative impact on our earnings 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk as of december   we have exposure to changes in interest rates since we had million outstanding on our unsecured credit agreement with jpmorgan chase bank  with million outstanding on the term loan and million outstanding on the revolver 
under the credit agreement  the interest rate on our borrowings is libor plus an additional to basis points based on our debt to ebitda ratio 
during the fourth quarter of calendar we entered into an interest rate swap contract which effectively converts the floating base interest rate on the term loan to a fixed rate 
accordingly  the base interest rate risk on the term loan has been eliminated  but we are still exposed to interest rate risk on the revolver 
however  a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would only have an approximate million pre tax annual effect under the revolver when fully utilized 
investment risk we are exposed to market risk as it relates to changes in the market value of our equity investments 
as of december   we had investments in equity securities totaling million see note investments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
if there were a adverse change in the value of our equity portfolio as of december   this would result in a non cash impairment charge of approximately million 
foreign currency exchange risk we face two risks related to foreign currency exchange translation risk and transaction risk 
amounts invested in our foreign operations are translated into us dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
the resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the stockholders equity section of the consolidated balance sheets 
our foreign subsidiaries generally collect revenues and pay expenses in currencies other than the united states dollar 
since the functional currencies of our foreign operations are generally denominated in the local currency of our subsidiaries  the foreign currency translation adjustments are reflected as a component of stockholders equity and do not impact operating results 
revenues and expenses in foreign currencies translate into higher or lower revenues and expenses in us dollars as the us dollar weakens or strengthens against other currencies 
therefore  changes in exchange rates may negatively affect our consolidated revenues and expenses as expressed in us dollars from foreign operations 
currency transaction gains or losses arising from transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are included within other income expense  net within the consolidated statements of operations 
currency transaction gains losses  net were million  million  and million during  and  respectively 
from time to time we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to offset the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
foreign exchange forward contracts are reflected at fair value with unrealized and realized gains and losses recorded in earnings
