item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto  included elsewhere herein 
factors affecting our results octane additives market developments and goodwill impairment in its second quarter filing on form q the company confirmed that venezuela  a major customer  had permanently left the octane additives formerly known as tel market for motor gasoline and the company was now planning and acting accordingly 
in and net sales to this customer were million and million respectively 
as a result  the company has recognized a significantly larger than anticipated charge million in the year for the impairment of octane additives business goodwill 
this mainly reflects the reduction in the anticipated discounted cash flows that had previously been assumed in the company s model that supported the value of octane additives business goodwill at the end of the first quarter  as a result of the loss of this major customer 
the company also indicated that the loss of this customer would require restructuring of the cost base and a review of manufacturing capacity 
the company has since completed the relocation of its european head office activities to the uk manufacturing site at ellesmere port as well as a number of high level personnel changes designed to streamline the corporate cost base 
the fuel specialties business has also consolidated its research and technology activities on the ellesmere port site following the relocation of certain activities from of the former fuel technology center at bletchley  uk 
the octane additives business scaled back the production of tel effective june in order to deal with the reduction in demand 
the company has since announced a further round of restructuring of manufacturing and support services at ellesmere port and recognized the restructuring charges  including pension curtailment charges  associated with that program 
the loss of venezuela as a major octane additives customer required the company to review its current and projected operational flexibility and liquidity 
the company therefore initiated discussions with its senior lenders in the third quarter 
as a result of those discussions the company agreed the terms of a new three and a half year financing facility of million that is appropriate to the company s needs in december as at december   the company had million of debt outstanding under its new senior credit facility agreement and was in compliance with all financial covenants therein as of december  the company is also  under its current projections  fully compliant with all of the financial covenants of the new financing facility

table of contents net sales net sales for of million are million higher than the million reported in fuel specialties sales of million were million higher than in sales in the americas grew by due to higher sales of cetane number improver and additives for diesel ahead of new legislation 
sales in the emea region grew by and sales in asia pacific grew by 
octane additives sales volumes are below the volumes for but sales value is only down by mainly due to price increases 
sales volumes to the americas are down due to the loss of business in venezuela 
sales to asia pacific have proved to be resilient and volumes were actually higher than in shipments to the middle east were ahead of shipments in sales to africa fell by from the level in and  as south africa has now left the market for octane additives for motor gasoline  we expect volumes to be down further in the newly acquired subsidiaries afc  leuna and finetex contributed million of the million additional sales in performance chemicals in the year 
gross profit at million gross profit was lower than in the gross profit margin for the company was compared to in higher margin octane additives sales were a smaller proportion of total sales in than in the same period in down from and this mix effect depressed the overall gross profit margin by approximately points 
in fuel specialties the gross margin at was percentage points lower than the gross margin in the gross margin has been impacted by the rapid growth in sales of relatively lower margin cetane number improvers in the usa and the loss of manufacturing margin as a result of the bycosin disposal in the gross profit margin in octane additives of was percentage points lower than the gross margin in in the fourth quarter  surplus remediation provision of million  relating to a former tel manufacturing site in germany  was released 
this represented percentage points of octane additives gross margin in in a million provision related to a take or pay contract for materials was released following a review of the likely material requirements 
however the recent loss of venezuelan volumes has forced a review of this contract and as a result a provision of million was recognized in the second quarter  this release of provision represents percentage points of octane additives gross margin in and the build up of provision in represented percentage points of gross margin 
the rest of the decline in gross margin is mainly due to a combination of higher production costs per ton and higher raw material costs per ton 
the gross margin in performance chemicals was in this is percentage points lower than the gross margin in the newly acquired subsidiaries have a lower gross margin than the previously existing businesses in this business unit although they also have lower selling  general and administrative costs 
operating expenses at million selling  general and administrative expenses were million higher than in this extra cost was primarily in the fuel specialties business where costs increased by 
table of contents million 
this included legal and other costs associated with the company s voluntary disclosure to ofac 
in octane additives selling  general and administrative costs were million lower than in due to a rationalization of selling expenses as certain sales offices have been closed 
in performance chemicals the full year impact of the and acquisitions increased selling  general and administrative expenses by million and this represents most of the increase for the division in these costs 
however at million  corporate costs were million lower when compared to this reflects the effect of the relocation of the european head office to the ellesmere port site and the streamlining of the executive structure 
a reversal from a pension credit to a pension charge resulted in additional costs of million 
these savings were offset by legal costs associated with the governance special investigation 
restructuring charge the company incurred restructuring costs of million in the equivalent charge in was million 
million was recognized in relation to a new cost reduction program in manufacturing and support activities on the tel manufacturing site 
a charge of million was recognized in relation to severance of corporate staff 
a charge of million was recognized under fas under a previous cost reduction program where leavers have stayed longer than their contractual notice periods 
associated with all of the severance programs a pension charge of million was recognized under fas as there has been a curtailment event due to the significant restructuring activity in the uk in a charge of million has been recognized in relation to the closure of the european head office in manchester  uk 
this charge represents a write off of fixed assets where the value has been impaired by the closure and other costs of closure 
a charge of million was recognized relating to fixed asset write offs resulting from the closure of the fuel technology centre in bletchley  uk 
a charge of million was recognized relating to severance costs arising from the decision to relocate the research and technology activities that had previously been carried out at that site to the ellesmere port  uk site

a charge of million has been recognized relating to the costs of salary  additional costs of professional advice and other emoluments paid to the previous chief executive officer as more fully described above in resignation of dennis kerrison as president and chief executive officer 
amortization of intangible assets the amortization charge was million in this is million higher than the charge recognized in in both periods a charge of million in the year related to the veritel 
table of contents intangible asset that is being amortized on a straight line basis and as such the charge is comparable year on year 
the remaining million relates to the amortization of intangible assets recognized in and in the acquisition accounting for the recent acquisitions 
impairment of octane additives business goodwill the company recognized a charge of million for the impairment of octane additives business goodwill in the loss of anticipated sales from venezuela was the principal reason for this unexpectedly high charge and reflects the loss of the anticipated future cash flows that had previously been assumed in the model that supported the value of octane additives business goodwill at the end of the charge in was million 
the company will continue to test the value of octane additives business goodwill at the end of each quarter and expects to recognize a charge of approximately million for the year ending december   if actual cash flows are in line with the company s current forecasts 
the charge remains critically dependent upon developments that affect the company s best estimates of future volumes of octane additives  future revenue  gross margins  selling and administrative costs as well as the fixed and working capital requirements of the business 
interest expense  interest income and other expense net at million the net interest expense is million higher than in this is principally because of the higher average level of net debt in when compared to the equivalent period in following the acquisition outflows in the second half of and early and the increase in us base rates 
in interest expense was million and interest income was million 
in interest expense was million and interest income was million 
other income and expense of million consists mainly of a million charge for the write off of an investment in the third quarter  a charge of million to fully provide against two other investments  million sundry other charges and a million charge for exchange losses on forward foreign exchange contracts 
income taxes the headline rate of income tax is in compared to in the change in the effective tax rate and the reason why the company is paying taxes on a loss making operation is that the charge for the impairment of octane additives business goodwill is not an allowable deduction for tax purposes 
the effective rate of tax for excluding the impairment of octane additives goodwill was compared to in discontinued operations the loss of million relates to the disposal of opci and the gamlen waste water treatment business 

table of contents results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal the following table is presented to show the impact of the acquisitions in effect of acquisitions on group results compared to in millions as reported effect of acquisitions before acquisitions as reported net sales gross profit selling general and administrative expense research and development expense amortization of intangible assets impairment of octane additives business goodwill restructuring charge loss on disposals operating income the table above includes the impact of the acquisition of leuna  the results of which were consolidated for six months in and the results of afc  the results of which have been consolidated for four months in the impact of the acquisition of the remaining of the shares in octel starreon llc has not been included as the results of octel starreon llc have been fully consolidated by the company since the inception of the joint venture in  with a corresponding charge in the minority interest line item

the effect of acquisitions on performance chemicals business results compared to is as follows in millions as reported effect of acquisitions performance chemicals before acquisitions as reported net sales gross profit selling general and administrative expense research and development amortization of intangible assets business operating income loss net sales total net sales for of million were million ahead of sales 
the sales figures have been adjusted from previously reported sales to reflect the disposal of the bycosin mexico business in and the disposals of octel performance chemicals inc and gamlen waste water treatment in the results of these businesses are now reported 
table of contents in the discontinued operations line item  net of tax 
the effect of acquisitions is reflected in the table above 
after adjusting for the effect of acquisitions  sales fell by million 
net sales in fuel specialties were million ahead of sales  after adjustment for the disposal of bycosin mexico 
of this million was due to the effect of the appreciation of the euro and sterling against the us dollar 
strong growth was experienced in the usa fuel specialties business 
there was also growth in the european refinery and performance business 
octane additives net sales fell by million with volumes down on volumes 
most of the reduction in volume was due to lower sales to the middle east down in volume and south east asia down in volume but sales to africa  outside of south africa  were ahead of volumes 
good price management mitigated the effect of the decrease in volumes 
net sales in the performance chemicals were significantly impacted by the acquisitions in the year  as is demonstrated in the table above 
after adjusting for the effect of acquisitions net sales were unchanged when compared to gross profit total gross profit for of million was million ahead of gross profit 
in fuel specialties  gross profit increased by million 
however  the gross profit margin fell from to 
the major reason for this was the delay in passing through higher costs of oil based raw materials to selling prices 
also the fair value adjustment arising on the acquisition of the remaining of octel starreon llc in the period required a million uplift to the carrying value of inventory to be recognized 
gross profit in the octane additives business at million was only million lower than in despite the reduction in net sales 
gross profit margin increased from to and was boosted by the million margin release of remediation provisions from the former production site at doberitz in germany 
the company reached an agreement in the fourth quarter of with the local authorities in germany on the scope of work to be carried out and as a result the level of provision required has been reviewed and adjusted accordingly 
in addition a million provision created in for a potential liability under a take or pay contract for raw material for tel has been released  as the decision to delay the reduction in manufacturing capacity has eliminated the expected liability under the contract 
this release accounts for of the increase in gross profit margin for the remaining increase in gross profit margin is attributed to strong selling price management 
in performance chemicals  the effect of the acquisitions on the gross margin can be seen above 
the gross profit margin including the impact of acquisitions remained static at around 

table of contents operating expenses operating expenses consist of selling  general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses 
they increased by million in to million  million of the increase being due to the effect of acquisitions 
in fuel specialties  operating expenses were up from million to million 
the main reason for the increase was the impact of the weaker us dollar on the significant sterling and euro denominated cost base 
in octane additives the increase in operating expenses was million including the effect of the weaker us dollar million 
the rest is due to increased administrative and selling costs in the uk 
in performance chemicals  the effect of the acquisitions on operating expenses can be seen from the table above 
in the existing business  operating income held constant as lower gross profits were balanced by savings in selling  general and administrative expense and in research and development spending 
there was a million increase in corporate costs 
the effect of the weaker us dollar on our predominantly uk based corporate cost base was million 
the external cost of compliance with the sarbanes oxley section certification process was million 
the remaining million of increase in the corporate costs line item is due to inflation and the increase of resources  predominantly in the areas of technology  finance and human resources 
due to the high proportion of inactive members in the company s principal defined benefit pension scheme in the uk  the net pension credit associated with this is reported separately 
the net pension credit was million lower in at million 
this was mainly due to the de risking of the pension fund as a result of the decision to invest in a higher proportion of bonds rather than equities 
the increase of million to million in reported research and development expense is mainly due to the reclassification of the cost of the uk fuel technology centre to research and development cost from selling general and administrative expense in restructuring costs a charge of million was recognized in related to restructuring activities  compared to a charge of million in the major elements of this charge were million expense for discretionary demolition of redundant facilities at ellesmere port  million in relation to the programme to streamline production capacity and site support costs that commenced in

this was million higher than the charge for in the fuel specialties business  a charge of million was recognized relating to the amortization of certain intangible assets identified on acquisition of the remaining of octel starreon llc in july a charge of million was recognized in the octane additives business due to the amortization of an intangible asset arising from the permanent source interruption payments to veritel  which is being amortized on a straight line basis over the six years ending december  in the performance chemicals business  a charge of million was recognized in relation to the acquisition of certain intangible assets identified during the fair value exercise that was undertaken on acquisition of afc 
operating income by business fuel specialties operating income was million below at million 
although sales and gross profits were both boosted by the effect of the weaker us dollar  operating expenses outweighed this benefit and reduced operating income 
in addition the effects of the fair value inventory charge and the charge for amortization of intangible assets in octel starreon llc further reduced operating income by million 
this was offset by a million increase in the operating income from aviation gas due to higher gross margins 
octane additives operating income was million below at million 
the one off releases mentioned above broadly offset the volume effect of the lower sales 
however  the higher operating expenses incurred were the main reason for the reduced operating income 
in performance chemicals  operating income was up by million on to a profit of million 
the effect of the acquisitions is the most significant reason for improvement and is shown in the table above 
impairment of octane additives business goodwill the company has recognized a charge of million for the impairment of octane additives business goodwill in there was no charge in  as a review of the discounted future cash flows indicated that these were sufficient to support the value of octane additives business goodwill at that date 
the company has tested octane additives 
table of contents business goodwill at the end of each quarter in and has recognized a charge in each quarter 
the charge in the first quarter was relatively small as the surplus discounted cash flow that existed at the end of was exhausted

of this total charge  million represents a write off of goodwill 
the share of goodwill written off represents the proportion of the disposed business relative to the fair value of the integrated petroleum specialties business outside of the usa 
the bycosin mexico subsidiaries were disposed of in their entirety and there is no ongoing involvement with that business and so the loss associated with that disposal  along with the operating income for the year to the date of disposal  has been included in discontinued operations 
the net loss on disposal of the bycosin mexico subsidiaries was million 
the remaining million of the loss on disposal of the bycosin assets has been included in operating income in the loss on disposals line item as the business continues to source product from bycosin in sweden to support the power and marine markets 
also included in the loss on disposals line item is a million profit arising on the disposal of the paris office of octel france that was no longer required following the integration of this business with gamlen france

discontinued operations the charge of million in relates to the disposal of the bycosin mexico subsidiaries and operating losses of octel performance chemicals inc and gamlen waste water treatment 
liquidity and financial condition net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was an inflow of million compared with an inflow of million in net income was lower by million mainly as a result of the non cash octane additives impairment charge of million compared to million in  the higher restructuring costs of million compared to million in and the million decline in sbu operating income including corporate costs 
net interest expense was higher by million but the income tax charge was million lower 
large tax payments in the year relating to tax charges from prior periods and the low current charge for taxation resulted in a significant reduction in the accrual for income taxes and other liabilities of million compared to a million increase in this accrual in of the million decrease in working capital million is due to a decrease of accounts receivable 
this was mainly due to the timing of year end shipments and payments in the octane additives business 
inventory increased by million

inventory also increased in support of sales growth in the fuel specialties business by million 
there has been an increased cash flow of million due to increases in accounts payable and accruals since december  the million reduction in the pension prepayment is mainly due to the curtailment charge of million 
table of contents relating to higher liabilities arising from restructuring that has not yet had a cash effect through funding of the defined benefit plan 
the high levels of restructuring expense recognized to date has resulted in an increase in the plant closure provision of million 
the million outflow on business combinations mainly represents the outlay  net of cash  acquired to purchase finetex million 
there was a million outflow as the company increased its stake in one of its other unconsolidated investments

the loss of venezuela as a major octane additives customer in the second quarter of required the company to review its current and projected operational flexibility and liquidity 
the company therefore initiated discussions with its senior lenders in the third quarter 
as a result of those discussions the company has agreed the terms of a new three and one half year financing facility more appropriate to the company s needs 
the new facility contains certain financial ratio covenants  specifically a ratio of net debt to ebitda a non us gaap measure that represents liquidity  a ratio of net interest expense to ebita another non us gaap measure and a ratio of net operating cash flow pre finance costs to scheduled debt amortization and interest costs 
ebitda and ebita are defined in the facility agreement 
the new financing facility also requires a look forward test to be applied while the ratio of net debt to ebitda exceeds this look forward test was not applicable to the company during due to such ratio not being exceeded 
as of december   the company had million of debt outstanding under its new senior credit facility agreement and was in compliance with all financial covenants therein as of december  the issue of treasury stock to holders of options who chose to exercise their options has raised million in million was spent in on the repurchase of  shares at an average price of

the net million drawdown was used to finance the acquisition of the shares of finetex  inc  the properties which this business uses and the associated fees 
in january  million of the previous borrowing facility had been repaid and million of the new borrowing facility drawn down 
in december  the company drew down the new term loan of million and million of the new revolving credit facility 

table of contents the debt profile as at december   including the principal facility and other group debt  is set out below in millions current portion of long term debt long term debt  net of current portion on april  the company paid a dividend of cents per share to shareholders under the semi annual program announced in on september  the company paid a further dividend of cents per share 
the company expects to fund its operations from operating cash flows and its existing financing facility over the next twelve months 
critical accounting estimates the policies and estimates that the company considers the most critical in terms of subjectivity and judgment of assessment are those related to environmental liabilities  the identification of and the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets  pension accounting  restructuring costs and the marketing agreements with ethyl 
any adverse variance between actual results and future projections in these areas may impact on results of operations and financial condition 
environmental liabilities the company records environmental liabilities when they are probable and costs can be estimated reasonably 
remediation provisions at december  amounted to million and relate principally to our sites in the uk  france and germany 
the company has to anticipate the program of work required and the associated future costs  and has to comply with environmental legislation in the relevant countries 
the company views the costs of vacating our main uk site as a contingent liability because there is no present intention to exit the site 
the company has further determined that  due to the uncertain product life of octane additives  particularly in the market for aviation gas  there exists such uncertainty as to the timing of such cash flows that it is not possible to estimate these flows sufficiently reliably to recognize a provision 
goodwill the company adopted fas goodwill and other intangible assets effective january  this requires that goodwill should no longer be amortized  but subject to an annual impairment review  or between years if events occur or circumstances change which suggest that an impairment may have occurred 

table of contents the company elected to perform its annual tests in respect of fuel specialties and performance chemicals goodwill as of december each year 
in reviewing for any impairment charge the fair value of the reporting units underlying the segments is estimated using an after tax cash flow methodology based on management s best estimates at that time 
during and  the goodwill impairment test for the octane additives business was performed annually at december both these reviews showed that the fair value of the reporting unit based on after tax cash flows at the company s weighted average cost of capital exceeded the carrying value of octane additives assets and  accordingly  no indicator of impairment existed and step of the fas impairment test was not performed 
in light of the continuing decline in the octane additives market globally  as the company makes sales of octane additives in each quarter  the remaining sales and corresponding cash flows that can be derived from the octane additives business are reduced  and accordingly the fair value of the octane additives reporting unit is reduced 
based on the company s detailed forecast model  assumptions at december  indicated that the reduction in forecast future cash flows during would reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below the carrying value of octane additives assets and  accordingly  there was likely to be a significant goodwill impairment charge during the year ended december  as a result the company determined that quarterly impairment reviews be performed from january  and any impairment charge arising be recognized in the relevant quarter 
the value of the remaining cash flows from the octane additives business is calculated at any review date by reference to the best available estimates for future revenues  gross margins  selling and administrative costs as well as the fixed and working capital requirements of the business 
the resulting cash flows are then discounted and the total discounted cash flows of the octane additives business are then allocated to the fair value of the octane additives business unit at that date 
the company uses this information to derive an implied goodwill value which is then compared to the carrying value to determine what impairment is needed 
using this methodology and the assumptions underlying the detailed forecast model  the company believes that it is possible to predict the pattern of likely future impairment charges of octane additives business goodwill 
this method reflects the relatively unique nature of the octane additives business 
as a result of the reviews performed during  an impairment charge of million was recognized in the year and the company expects to incur charges in subsequent years as the octane additives market continues to decline 
goodwill of million associated with sales of tel for aviation gasoline was transferred to the fuel specialties business 
there is million of goodwill relating to the octane additives business 
intangible assets at december   the company performed its annual impairment review for goodwill for fuel specialties and performance chemicals and believes that there has been no 
table of contents impairment of goodwill in respect of those reporting segments 
goodwill of million was created on the acquisition of finetex in in  as part of the fair value accounting for the acquisitions the company identified certain intangible assets in finetex 
an intangible asset of million was recognized in finetex in respect of a number of ongoing customer relationships in that company

the continuation of the prepayment depends on the fair value of the plan assets exceeding the accumulated benefit obligation 
this surplus at the measurement date  october   was million 
in the event of a deficit  a liability would be created equal to the sum of the prepayment and the deficit  and the related charge would be reported in accumulated other comprehensive income

this was accounted for under fas as it was initiated after january  the scheme had a statutory element and an incentive element for agreeing to voluntary severance 
the severance terms were also more generous than statutory terms

sales and marketing agreement the company has entered into a number of sales and marketing agreements with the ethyl corporation ethyl for the sale of tel in all areas of the world except north america and the european economic area through december  under these agreements we produce the tel and all marketing and sales effort is in the innospec name 
ethyl provides bulk distribution  marketing and other services 
the net proceeds are paid to ethyl and innospec on an agreed formula  with innospec receiving of the total 
sales and expenses incurred under the agreement are included within the company s income statement 
ethyl s share of the net proceeds for services is charged within cost of goods sold 
the majority of net proceeds are calculated and settled on a monthly basis  but there is an element receivable by the company from ethyl which is computed annually in arrears 
in prior years the amounts involved were not significant  but because of increases in the value of this retrospective element we decided effective january   that it was more appropriate to recognize a prudent accrual during the year  based on best current estimates of the expected outcome 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses innospec s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to environmental remediation  impairment of goodwill and intangible assets  pension accounting  restructuring costs and marketing agreements with ethyl 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
note to the financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the financial statements 
the policies and estimates that the company considers the most critical in terms of complexity and subjectivity of assessment are those related to environmental liabilities  impairment of goodwill and intangible assets  pension accounting  restructuring costs and our marketing agreements with ethyl corporation 
any adverse variance between actual results and the company s projections in these areas may impact on results of operations and financial condition

estimated commitment fees are also included and interest income is excluded 
the amounts related to the pension scheme refer to the likely levels of company funding of the uk defined benefit pensions scheme and certain pension commitments to senior employees 
it is not meaningful to predict an amount after five years because there are so many uncertainties about wage rates and employment levels 

table of contents environmental matters and plant closures the company is subject to environmental laws in all of the countries in which it operates 
under certain environmental laws  the company is responsible for the remediation of hazardous substances or wastes at currently or formerly owned or operated properties 
most of our manufacturing operations have been conducted outside the united states and  therefore  any liability pertaining to the investigation and remediation of contaminated properties is likely to be determined under non us law 
we evaluate costs for remediation  decontamination and demolition projects on a regular basis 
full provision of million is made for those costs to which we are committed under environmental laws 
expenditure against provisions was million  million and million in the years  and  respectively 
we have also incurred personnel severance costs in relation to the management of the decline in the tel market and the restructuring of the fuel specialties business 
total severance expenditure was million  million  million in the years  and  respectively 
provision is made for severance costs under the conditions of fas and fas the provision at december  was million 
severance charges recognized in the income statement in relating to the restructuring program were million 
the company expects that a further million will be recognized in in respect of current severance programs under fas inflation inflation has not been a significant factor for the company over the last several years 
management believes that inflation will continue to be moderate over the next several years 
cautionary statement for safe harbor purposes certain written and oral statements made by our company and subsidiaries or with the approval of an authorized executive officer of our company  including statements made in the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations or elsewhere in this report and in other filings with the securities and exchange commission  may constitute forward looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements include all statements which address operating performance  events or developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future 
although such statements are believed by management to be reasonable when made  caution should be exercised not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements  which are subject to certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
if the risks or uncertainties ever materialize or the assumptions prove incorrect  actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward looking statements and assumptions 
risks  assumptions and uncertainties include  without limitation  changes in the terms of trading with 
table of contents significant customers or gain or loss thereof  the effects of changing government regulations and economic and market conditions  competition and changes in demand and business and legal risks inherent in non us activities  including political and economic uncertainty  import and export limitations and market risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates  government investigations  material fines or other penalties resulting from the company s voluntary disclosure to the office of foreign assets control of the us department of the treasury and other risks  uncertainties and assumptions identified in the company s annual report on form k for the year ended december  and those identified in the company s other reports filed with the securities and exchange commission 
the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company operates manufacturing and blending facilities  offices and laboratories around the world  though the largest manufacturing facility is located in the uk 
the company sells a range of fuel specialties  performance chemicals and octane additives to customers around the world 
the company uses floating rate debt to finance these global operations 
consequently  the company is subject to business risks inherent in non us activities  including political and economic uncertainty  import and export limitations  and market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
the political and economic risks are mitigated by the stability of the countries in which the company s largest operations are located 
credit limits  ongoing credit evaluation and account monitoring procedures are used to minimize bad debt risk 
collateral is not generally required 
the company uses derivatives  including interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward exchange contracts  in the normal course of business to manage market risks 
the derivatives used in hedging activities are considered risk management tools and are not used for trading purposes 
in addition  the company enters into derivative instruments with a diversified group of major financial institutions in order to monitor the exposure to non performance of such instruments 
the company s objective in managing exposure to changes in interest rates is to limit the impact of such changes on earnings and cash flow and to lower overall borrowing costs 
the company s objective in managing the exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates is to reduce volatility on earnings and cash flow associated with such changes 
interest rate risk the company uses interest swaps to manage interest rate exposure 
as of december  the company had cash and cash equivalents of million with no bank overdraft 
as of december  long term debt stood at million including a current component of million 
the company entered into new interest swap agreements in that cover million of the million term debt 
on the basis that million of the million senior term loan is hedged against interest movements and that the company would receive interest on the positive cash balances  then unhedged debt  net of cash balances was million 
thus a hypothetical absolute change of in interest rates on the net amount of these balances for a one year period would reduce net income and 
table of contents cash flows by around million before tax 
on a gross basis  assuming no additional interest on the cash balances  a increase in us libor interest rates would reduce net income and cash flows by approximately million before tax 
the above does not consider the effect of interest or exchange rate changes on overall activity  nor management action to mitigate such changes 
exchange rate risk approximately of the company s forecast sales for are denominated in us dollars with the balance mainly comprising euros over and sterling around 
the reporting currency of the company is the us dollar 
the company evaluates the functional currency of each reporting unit according to the economic environment in which it operates 
several major subsidiaries of the company operating outside of the us have the us dollar as their functional currency because of the nature of the markets in which they operate 
in the fuel specialties business more than of forecast sales are denominated in dollars and more than in euros 
the fuel specialties is reasonably well hedged against a increase in the us dollar against the euro but expenses in sterling exceed gross profit 
for this reason such a shift in exchange rates  while reducing net sales by around million would increase operating income by around million for this business 
the octane additives market is predominantly a us dollar market  although sales to certain territories are transacted in euros 
tel raw materials are purchased in a mixture of us dollars  sterling and euros but when the ethyl compensation payments are taken into account  over of gross profit is denominated in us dollars with unmatched expenses in sterling 
selling  administrative and general expenses are generally in the currency of the legal entity with the majority being denominated in sterling 
a increase in the us dollar against both sterling and the euro would result in additional operating income of million  due mainly to the lower burden of the sterling denominated cost of goods sold and operating expenses 
in the performance chemicals business approximately of forecast sales are denominated in euros  with the remainder split between us dollars around and sterling around 
due mainly to the large operating profits denominated in euros  a increase in the us dollar against both sterling and the euro would reduce operating profit by approximately million 
corporate costs are largely denominated in sterling 
a increase in the us dollar against both the euro and sterling would increase reported operating income by approximately million 
in all cases where a increase of the us dollar has been used as an illustration  a decrease would be expected to have the opposite effect on operating income 
future outlook the future outlook reflects the dichotomy between the growing fuel specialties and performance chemicals businesses and the declining octane additives business 

table of contents the fuel specialties business grew significantly in through acquisitions 
the purchase of the remaining of octel starreon in gave the company control over the strategy for growth in the key us fuel additives market  particularly in the field of additives for the growing diesel market 
the business grew organically by in the business will continue to pursue organic growth of to in its three key regions  europe  middle east and africa emea  usa and asia pacific 
the company has taken steps to restructure its back office and support operations to support this growth 
in the last three years  octane additives sales have declined from to of the company total  and its share of gross profit has fallen from to 
we expect octane additives to continue to decline in importance in the overall company results 
the tel market has been in decline since the s  and this trend is expected to continue 
given the uncertainties in the asian  african and south american markets  world market decline in is likely to be at the high end of the to range 
cost control initiatives and a reduction in manufacturing capacity have delivered benefits in the current year  and the company will continue to manage costs in this area 
we expect the octane additives business to continue to be cash generative 
the performance chemicals business grew substantially by acquisition in the full year impact of these acquisitions on operating income has now been seen in in accordance with the company s strategy of reinvesting the cash flows from the octane additives into growth opportunities in its other businesses  the company completed the acquisition of finetex  inc in january the company is building strategic positions in the personal care and aroma markets and also in the field of waxes 
the company also has a toll manufacturing base in the usa 
growth in sales in this business segment is expected to be around approximately per year 
the business will seek a step change in operating margins in as it addresses the balance between raw material and energy costs and selling prices and addresses certain production bottlenecks 
following our adoption of fas in  the annual amortization charge on goodwill has been replaced by an impairment review process 
the continued decline in the octane additives market will inevitably result in impairment charges in future years 
our latest review has revealed a need to recognize further impairment charges for octane additives business goodwill impairment in each period until the octane additives business cash flows are exhausted 
an annual impairment review of the goodwill relating to the fuel specialties and performance chemicals business segments indicates that there is no requirement to recognize an impairment charge in respect of this goodwill
