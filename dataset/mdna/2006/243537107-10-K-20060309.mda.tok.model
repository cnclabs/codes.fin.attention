overview we are a leading designer  producer and brand manager of innovative high quality footwear and the category creator in the sport sandal and luxury sheepskin footwear segments 
our products are marketed under three recognized brand names that we own teva high performance sport sandals and rugged outdoor footwear  ugg authentic luxury sheepskin boots and a full line of luxury and comfort footwear  and simple innovative shoes that combine the comfort elements of athletic footwear with casual styling 
we sell our three brands through our quality domestic retailers and international distributors and directly to end user consumers through our websites  catalogs and retail outlet stores 
we sell our footwear in both the domestic market and the international markets 
independent third parties manufacture all of our footwear 

table of contents our business has been impacted by several important trends affecting our end markets the markets for casual  outdoor and athletic footwear have grown significantly during the last decade 
we believe this growth is a result of the trend toward casual dress in the workplace  increasingly active outdoor lifestyles and a growing emphasis on comfort 
consumers are more often seeking footwear designed to address a broader array of activities with the same quality  comfort  and high performance attributes they have come to expect from traditional athletic footwear 
our customers have narrowed their footwear product breadth  focusing on brands with a rich heritage and authenticity as market creators and leaders 
consumers have become increasingly focused on luxury and comfort  seeking out products and brands that are fashionable while still comfortable 
by emphasizing our brand image and our focus on comfort  performance and authenticity  we believe we can better maintain a loyal consumer following that is less susceptible to fluctuations caused by changing fashions and changes in consumer preferences 
set forth below is an overview of the various components of our business  including some of the important factors that affect each business and some of our strategies for growing each business 
teva overview from fiscal to  teva s wholesale net sales increased at a compound annual growth rate of 
however  for the year ended december   teva wholesale net sales decreased by approximately compared to the year ago period 
the recent decline has been due to several factors including an unseasonably cold spring season  increased competition  a recent lack of meaningful product innovation  and a decline in sales in the european market 
we are proactively addressing the situation going forward by dedicating significantly greater resources to product development  marketing and advertising and the development of a solid international infrastructure 
however  given the lead times required for these projects to yield results  we anticipate continued challenges in  but expect to return to growth for teva beginning with the spring season 
despite the recent downturn  we believe that over the last few years teva s products have benefited from several factors  but most prominently a general shift in consumer preferences and lifestyles to include more outdoor recreational activities 
at the same time  our consumers are increasingly purchasing our teva products for everyday wear  and our teva brand now includes several closed toe footwear lines 
as a result  our brand remains popular among professional and amateur outdoorsmen seeking authentic  performance oriented footwear  as well as general footwear consumers seeking high quality  durable and comfortable styles for everyday use 
to capitalize on the growth of outdoor recreational activities and the acceptance of certain footwear products for everyday use  over the last few years we have selectively expanded the distribution of our teva product lines outside our core outdoor specialty and sporting goods channels 
through effective channel management  we believe we can continue to expand into new distribution channels without diluting our outdoor heritage and our appeal to outdoor enthusiasts 
through appropriate channel product line expansion  we plan to continue to broaden our product offerings beyond sport sandals to new products that meet the style and functional needs of our consumers 
we initially produced teva products under a license from the inventor of the teva technology  mark thatcher 
in november   we purchased from mr 
thatcher the teva worldwide assets  including the teva internet and catalog business and all patents  trade names  trademarks and other intellectual property associated with the acquired teva assets  or the teva rights 
as a result of our purchase of the teva rights  we have adopted a strategy to expand the teva brand and more fully develop its potential 
ugg overview since early  our ugg brand has received increased media exposure  which contributed to broader public awareness of the ugg brand and significantly increased demand for the collection 
we believe that the increased 
table of contents media focus on ugg was driven by the product s unique styling and resulting brand name identification  australian heritage and adoption by high profile film and television celebrities as a favored footwear brand 
we believe this increased media attention has enabled us to introduce the brand to consumers much faster than we would have ordinarily been able to 
as a result of the subsequent rapid growth in demand  we were sold out of key ugg products throughout much of  and given the long lead times required to replenish our inventory  we were unable to fill many retailer reorders and many direct internet and catalog orders 
in order to improve our ability to meet demand and to ensure more timely deliveries in  we purchased our ugg product from the independent factories in much earlier than we had purchased it in  resulting in an increase in our ugg inventory levels throughout much of in comparison to however  as the fall and winter selling season came to an end  our ugg inventories were substantially reduced to  at december  compared to  at september  and are just  higher than the  at december  see liquidity and capital resources 
ugg has been a well known brand in california for many years and over the past few years has become a recognized brand throughout the remainder of the country 
we believe that a portion of ugg s increased demand is due to our continued geographical expansion across the us in addition  we have recently begun to expand our distribution and marketing overseas in order to address the under penetrated international markets 
net sales of ugg in the international markets aggregated  in   in and  in despite the slight decline in  we believe that with our strategy to develop an international infrastructure  the international markets represent an attractive opportunity to grow ugg s sales over the next few years 
we believe the fundamental comfort and functionality of ugg products will continue to drive long term consumer demand 
recognizing that there is a significant fashion element to ugg and that footwear fashions fluctuate  our strategy seeks to prolong the longevity of the brand by offering a broader product line suitable for wear in a variety of climates and occasions and by limiting distribution to selected higher end retailers 
as part of this strategy  we have expanded our product line to models in from models in this product line expansion includes our significantly expanded fall fashion collection and men s offering  as well as new styles in our driving collection  our newly introduced surf collection  our cold weather collection and our luxury slipper category 
nevertheless  we cannot assure investors that ugg sales will continue to grow at their recent pace or that revenue from ugg products will not at some point decline 
four suppliers currently provide all of the sheepskin  the principal raw material for our ugg products  purchased by our independent manufacturers 
the top quality sheepskin used in ugg footwear is in high demand and limited supply 
in addition  sheep are susceptible to hoof and mouth disease  which can result in the extermination of the infected herd and could have a material adverse effect on the availability of sheepskin for our products 
the supply of sheepskin can also be adversely impacted by drought conditions 
our potential inability to obtain top quality sheepskin for ugg products could impair our ability to meet our production requirements for ugg products in a timely manner and could lead to inventory shortages  which can result in lost potential sales  delays in shipments to customers  strain on our relationships with customers and diminished brand loyalty 
there have also been significant increases in the prices of footwear quality sheepskin as the demand for this material has increased 
any further price increases will likely raise our costs  increase our costs of sales and decrease our profitability unless we are able to pass higher prices on to our customers 
while we believe the supply of top quality sheepskin has improved over the last year  we still believe the demand for this material may continue to outpace supply in the future  leading to possible shortages and our inability to produce as much of certain styles as our customers would like to order 
longer term  if demand continues to be strong  we would expect the supply of top quality sheepskin to continue to increase in response to the demand 
however  we have little control over the supply or the overall demand for top quality sheepskin and  accordingly  can provide no assurances about the sufficiency of future supplies of top quality sheepskin 
simple overview in  the simple product line focused on rebuilding its core product segments  sneakers and clogs  while abandoning its simple sheep program launched in the third quarter of simple s core sneaker and clog lines have shown strong growth of in the year ended december  when compared to last year 
we continue to introduce new styles and categories of footwear under the simple brand  including the newly introduced green 
table of contents toe tm collection of natural  ecologically friendly footwear  which has been well received by retailers and the media 
at the same time  we have changed our sales and distribution efforts through increased marketing efforts as well as improvements in distribution through the establishment of separate dedicated sales representatives for the simple brand in several territories 
we expect our simple brand to experience growth as we continue to develop our re focused product line and successfully implement our strategy to expand our distribution channels for the simple brand 
consumer direct overview our consumer direct business includes our internet and catalog retailing operations as well as our retail outlets stores 
we acquired our internet and catalog retailing business in november as part of the acquisition of the teva rights 
in  we also opened a retail outlet store in a premium retail outlet mall in camarillo  california in addition to our other retail outlet store at the ventura  california distribution center 
we currently expect to open additional retail outlet stores in select premium outlet malls in the us and currently anticipate opening up to three additional stores in  based on the success of the existing stores 
our consumer direct business  which today sells all three of our brands  enables us to meet the growing demand for these products  sell the products at retail prices and provide us with significant incremental operating income 
from the time we initiated our consumer direct business through  we have had significant revenue growth  much of which occurred as the underlying brands gained popularity  as consumers have continued to increase reliance on the internet for footwear and other purchases and as we began to open retail outlet stores 
net sales of the consumer direct business were  in   in and  in managing our internet business requires us to focus on generating internet traffic to our websites  to effectively convert website visits into orders and to maximize average order sizes 
we distribute approximately  catalogs every six months to drive our catalog order business 
overall  our consumer direct business benefits from the strength of our brands and  as we grow our brands over time  we expect this business to continue to be an important segment of our business 
licensing overview in  we embarked on a strategy to license our well known and respected footwear brands to complementary products outside of footwear  generally in the apparel and accessories categories 
we currently have several licensing agreements for teva  including us licenses for men s and women s headwear and socks  a canadian sportswear license and a newly signed license for bags and packs to be delivered for the spring season 
we have recently terminated our previous domestic licensing agreements for time pieces  eyewear and men s apparel 
we also have licensing arrangements for ugg for handbags and other small leather goods  outerwear and cold weather accessories 
because this licensing strategy is in its early stages  and due to the lead times required to bring the products to market  we have only recently begun to recognize licensing revenues and we do not expect significant incremental net sales and profits from licensing in the near future 
however  we believe licensing revenues may become a more significant portion of our net sales and profits over time if we can recruit strong licensees and if our licensees can sell the licensed products in the quantities and of the quality they have projected 
beginning in the third quarter of  our licensees began to ship their products 
for the year ended december   we recognized net license revenues for ugg of  related to our ugg handbag  outerwear and cold weather accessories licenses  and recognized  for teva licenses  approximately  of which was related to final payments on our terminated apparel  time pieces  and eyewear licenses 
the minimum net annual royalties that we are scheduled to receive under the remaining existing licensing agreements  assuming renewal options are exercised  are  in   in   in and  in the activity is currently very small in relation to the consolidated operations and  therefore  separate segment information is not presented 

table of contents seasonality our business is seasonal  with the highest percentage of teva net sales occurring in the first and second quarters of each year and the highest percentage of ugg net sales occurring in the third and fourth quarters 
to date  simple has not had a seasonal impact on the company 
first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter net sales income from operations first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter net sales income from operations with the dramatic growth in ugg in recent years  combined with the introduction of a fall teva line  net sales in the last half of the year have exceeded that for the first half of the year 
given our expectations for each of our brands in  we currently expect this trend to continue 
nonetheless  actual results could differ materially depending upon consumer preferences  availability of product  competition and our customers continuing to carry and promote our various product lines  among other risks and uncertainties

international sales for all of our products decreased by  or  from  in to  in  representing of net sales in and of net sales in the lower dollar amount of international sales resulted from declines in both teva and ugg in the european market

gross profit increased by  or  from  in to  in as a percentage of net sales  gross profit margin was comparable at in both and  due to several offsetting factors 
gross margin was favorably impacted by the elimination of the airfreight costs incurred by ugg in  the lower overhead costs per pair resulting from our leverage of fixed overhead costs over a greater production volume in and the increase in domestic sales  which generally have a higher gross margin than our international sales 
these favorable items were offset by an increase in inventory write downs and closeout sales in combined with an increase in ugg sales  which generally carry a lower gross margin than sales of our teva and simple product lines

the seasonality of our business requires us to build inventory levels in anticipation of the sales for the coming season 
teva generally begins to build inventory levels beginning in the fourth quarter and first quarter in anticipation of the spring selling season that occurs in the first and second quarters  whereas ugg generally builds its inventories in the second quarter and third quarter to support sales for the fall and winter selling seasons  which historically occur during the third and fourth quarters 
in addition  throughout much of we increased our ugg inventories significantly compared to the corresponding levels in the year ago period in order to better meet demand and ensure more timely deliveries to our retail partners in the fall and winter season this year 
however  as the fall and winter selling season came to an end  our ugg inventories were substantially reduced to  at december  compared to  at september  and are just  higher than the  at december  our cash flow cycle includes the purchase of these inventories  the subsequent sale of the inventories and the eventual collection of the resulting accounts receivable 
as a result  our working capital requirements begin when we purchase the inventories and continue until we ultimately collect the resulting receivables

overall  inventory turnover decreased to times for the year ended december  from times for the year ended december  largely due to increased inventory levels for ugg during in order to improve our ability to meet demand and to ensure more timely ugg deliveries in compared to  we greatly improved our production timelines and sourcing in  resulting in an increase in our ugg inventory levels throughout much of in comparison to however  as the fall and winter selling season came to an end  our ugg inventories were substantially reduced to  at december  compared to  at september  and are just  higher than the  level at december  the  decrease in teva inventory reflects our continuing efforts to bring our teva inventory into stock closer to when we expect it to be shipped to our customers and reflects our current expectations for lower teva sales in spring than we experienced in spring the  increase in simple inventory is in anticipation of increased spring sales in comparison to the spring sales levels 
our revolving credit facility with comerica bank the facility provided for a maximum availability of  for the period from september  to december   and  for the remainder of the term  subject to a borrowing base 
in general  the borrowing base is equal to of eligible accounts receivable  as defined  and of eligible inventory  as defined 
up to  of borrowings may be in the form of letters of credit 
the facility bears interest at the lender s prime rate at december  or  at our option  at libor at december  plus to  depending on our ratio of liabilities to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda  and is secured by substantially all of our assets 
the facility includes annual commitment fees of  per year and expires on june  at december   we had no outstanding borrowings under the facility  no foreign currency reserves for outstanding forward contracts and outstanding letters of credit aggregated  as a result   was available under the facility at december  the agreements underlying the facility contain several financial covenants including a quick ratio requirement  profitability requirements and a tangible net worth requirement  among others  as well as a prohibition on the payment of dividends 
we were in compliance with all covenants at december   and remain so as of the date of this report 
capital expenditures totaled  for the year ended december   and related primarily to the opening and expansion of an additional distribution center  the replacement of certain computer equipment and trade show booths  the opening of the camarillo retail outlet store and the purchase of promotional vehicles for the teva marketing team 
we currently have no material commitments for future capital expenditures but estimate that the capital expenditures for will range from approximately  to  and may include additional costs associated with further improvements at our distribution centers  computer system updates  the addition of new retail outlet stores and the purchase of new tradeshow booths 
the actual amount of capital expenditures for may differ from this estimate  largely depending on any unforeseen needs to replace existing assets and the timing of expenditures 
contractual obligations 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december  and the effects such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
payments due by period less than more than total year years years years operating lease obligations we previously had significant interest payment requirements on the long term debt obligations discussed above 
however  since we paid off all the outstanding balances on our long term debt as of december   we have no future interest payments scheduled 
we believe that internally generated funds  the available borrowings under our existing credit facilities and cash on hand will provide sufficient liquidity to enable us to meet our current and foreseeable working capital requirements 
however  risks and uncertainties that could impact our ability to maintain our cash position include our growth rate  the continued strength of our brands  our ability to respond to changes in consumer preferences  our 
table of contents ability to collect our receivables in a timely manner  our ability to effectively manage our inventories and the volume of letters of credit used to purchase product  among others 
see risk factors for a discussion of additional factors that may affect our working capital position 
furthermore  we may require additional cash resources due to changed business conditions or other future developments  including any investments or acquisitions we may decide to pursue 
if these sources are insufficient to satisfy our cash requirement  we may seek to sell debt securities or additional equity securities or to obtain a credit facility 
the sale of convertible debt securities or additional equity securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
the incurrence of indebtedness would result in incurring debt service obligations and could result in operating and financial covenants that would restrict our operations 
in addition  there can be no assurance that any additional financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
although there are no present understandings  commitments or agreements with respect to the acquisition of any other businesses  we may  from time to time  evaluate acquisitions of other businesses 
impact of inflation we believe that the relatively moderate rates of inflation in recent years have not had a significant impact on our net sales or profitability 
critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when products are shipped and the customer takes title and assumes risk of loss  collection of relevant receivable is probable  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  and the sales price is fixed or determinable 
allowances for estimated returns  discounts  and bad debts are provided for when related revenue is recorded 
amounts billed for shipping and handling costs are recorded as a component of net sales  while the related costs paid to third party shipping companies are recorded as a cost of sales 
in addition  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosures about contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period 
management bases these estimates and assumptions upon historical experience  existing  known circumstances  authoritative accounting pronouncements and other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
management reasonably could use different estimates and assumptions  and changes in estimates and assumptions could occur from period to period  with the result in each case being a potential material change in the financial statement presentation of our financial condition or results of operations 
we have historically been accurate in our estimates used for the reserves and allowances below 
we believe that the estimates and assumptions below are among those most important to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements contained in this report 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we provide a reserve against trade accounts receivable for estimated losses that may result from customers inability to pay 
we determine the amount of the reserve by analyzing known uncollectible accounts  aged trade accounts receivables  economic conditions  historical experience and the customers credit worthiness 
trade accounts receivable that are subsequently determined to be uncollectible are charged or written off against this reserve 
the reserve includes specific reserves for accounts  which are identified as potentially uncollectible  plus a non specific reserve for the balance of accounts based on our historical experience with bad debts 
reserves have been fully established for all expected or probable losses of this nature 
the gross trade accounts receivable balance was  and the allowance for doubtful accounts was  at december   compared to gross trade accounts receivable of  and allowance for doubtful accounts of  at december  the increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts at december  compared to december  was primarily related to the bankruptcy of a significant customer  steve s shoes  as well as additional reserves established for our domestic ugg receivables 
our use of different estimates and assumptions could produce different financial results 
for example  a change in the rate used to estimate the reserve for the accounts not specifically identified as uncollectible would change the allowance for doubtful accounts at december  by  reserve for sales discounts 
a significant portion of our domestic net sales and resulting trade accounts receivable reflects a discount that the customers may take  generally based upon meeting certain order  shipment 
table of contents and payment timelines 
we estimate the amount of the discounts that are expected to be taken against the period end trade accounts receivable and we record a corresponding reserve for sales discounts 
we determine the amount of the reserve for sales discounts considering the amounts of available discounts in the period end accounts receivable aging and historical discount experience  among other factors 
the reserve for sales discounts was approximately  at december  and  at december  the increase in the reserve for sales discounts at december  compared to december  is primarily due to the increase in the gross trade accounts receivable during the period and an increase in volume discounts for certain customers 
our use of different estimates and assumptions could produce different financial results 
for example a change in the estimate of the percentage of accounts that will ultimately take their discount would change the reserve for sales discounts at december  by  allowance for estimated returns 
we record an allowance for anticipated future returns of goods shipped prior to period end 
in general  we accept returns for damaged or defective products but discourage returns for other reasons 
we base the amount of the allowance on any approved customer requests for returns  historical returns experience and any recent events that could result in a change in historical returns rates  among other factors 
the allowance for returns was  at december  and  at december  the increase in the allowance for estimated returns increased due to an increase in net sales during the three months ended december  compared to the three months ended december   including a significant increase in the internet sales of our consumer direct business which generally has a substantially higher return rate than that for our wholesale business 
our use of different estimates and assumptions could produce different financial results 
for example  a change in the rate used to estimate the percentage of sales expected to ultimately be returned would change the reserve for returns at december  by approximately  inventory write downs 
inventories are stated at lower of cost or market 
we review the various items in inventory on a regular basis for excess  obsolete and impaired inventory 
in doing so  we write the inventory down to the lower of cost or estimated future net selling prices 
at december   inventories were stated at  net of inventory write downs of  at december   inventories were stated at  net of inventory write downs of  the increase in inventory write downs at december  compared to december  includes write downs for greater quantities of discontinued styles than we had at december  our use of different estimates and assumptions could produce different financial results 
for example  a change in the estimated selling prices of our potentially obsolete inventory would change the inventory write down amount at december  by approximately valuation of goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets 
we periodically assess the impairment of goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets based on assumptions and judgments regarding the carrying value of these assets 
we test goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis based on the fair value of the reporting unit goodwill or assets nonamortizable intangibles compared to its carrying value 
we consider other long lived assets to be impaired if we determine that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
among other considerations  we consider the following factors the assets ability to continue to generate income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods  our future plans regarding utilization of the assets  any changes in legal ownership of rights to the assets  and changes in consumer demand or acceptance of the related brand names  products or features associated with the assets 
if we consider the assets to be impaired  we recognize an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets 
in addition  as it relates to long lived assets  we base the useful lives and related amortization or depreciation expense on the estimate of the period that the assets will generate sales or otherwise be used by us

 goodwill and other intangible assets  became effective and as a result  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge in the first quarter of of  net of the related income tax benefit of

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk derivative instruments 
although we have used foreign currency hedges in the past  we no longer utilize forward contracts or other derivative instruments to mitigate exposure to fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rate as all of our purchases and sales for the foreseeable future will be denominated in us currency 
although our sales are denominated in us currency  our sales may be impacted by fluctuations in the exchange rates between the us dollar and the local currencies in the international markets where our products are sold 
if the us dollar strengthens  it may result in increased pricing pressure on our distributors  which may have a negative impact on our net sales 
we are unable to estimate the amount of any impact on sales attributed to pricing pressures caused by fluctuations in exchange rates 
market risk 
our market risk exposure with respect to financial instruments is to changes in the prime rate in the us and changes in libor 
our revolving line of credit provides for interest on outstanding borrowings at rates tied to the prime rate or at our election tied to libor 
at december   we had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving line of credit 
a increase in interest rates on our current borrowings would have no impact on income before income taxes
