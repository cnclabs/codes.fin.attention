overview operational overview 
we are a leading distributor of professional grade test  measurement  and calibration equipment and provider of nationally recognized and accredited calibration services across a wide array of measurement disciplines 
we operate our business through two reportable business segments that offer different products and services to the same customer base 
those two segments are distribution products and calibration services 
in our distribution products segment  our master catalog is widely recognized by both original equipment manufacturers and customers as the ultimate source for test and measurement equipment 
additionally  because we specialize in test and measurement equipment  as opposed to a wide array of industrial products  our sales and customer service personnel can provide value added technical assistance to our customers to assist them in determining what product best meets their particular application requirements 
our strength in our calibration services segment is based upon our wide range of disciplines and our investment in the quality systems that are required in our targeted market segments 
our services range from the calibration of a single unit to managing a customer s entire calibration program 

table of contents our revenue in our distribution products segment can be heavily impacted by changes in the economic environment 
as industrial customers increase or curtail capital and discretionary spending  our product sales will typically be directly impacted 
absent significant economic volatility  we do not see this segment of our business as having high growth potential 
the majority of our products are not consumables but are purchased as replacements  upgrades  or for expansion of manufacturing and research and development facilities 
year over year sales growth in any one quarter can be impacted by a number of factors including the addition of new product lines or channels of distribution 
we believe our calibration services segment offers considerable growth opportunity and the potential for continuing revenue from established customers from what is typically an annual calibration cycle 
we evaluate sales growth in both of our business segments against a four quarter trend analysis  and not by analyzing any single quarter 
financial overview 
our direct markets benefited in our distribution products segment  which grew in line with our expectation of mid single digits 
our overall product growth rate of calculated on dollars in thousands was favorably impacted by above average growth in sales to indirect markets who have well established customer bases of their own 
in addition  while our growth rate in canadian denominated sales dollars was calculated on dollars in thousands  a stronger canadian dollar resulted in a calculated on dollars in thousands growth rate in us denominated sales dollars 
calibration services sales  although resulting in an calculated on dollars in thousands growth rate in comparison to the prior year  did not meet our overall growth expectations  especially in our fourth quarter 
our overall gross margin  as a percent of sales  was consistent with the prior year 
on a segment basis  our distribution products gross margin ratio improved slightly as we continued to focus on controlling promotional pricing  offset to a degree by increased sales to indirect markets 
in our calibration services segment  we have continued to balance cost control with the investment to support growth initiatives 
those initiatives included our acquisition of the laboratory assets in san juan  puerto rico  where we believe there is exceptional growth opportunity  doubling the size of our houston laboratory and increasing our staff of qualified technicians 
these investments  in combination with our fourth quarter sales not achieving our expectations  resulted in a point calculated on dollars in thousands gross margin decline in the segment from fiscal year to critical accounting policies and estimates financial reporting release no 
requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting principles or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
note of our consolidated financial statements includes a complete discussion of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
a summary of our most critical accounting policies follows use of estimates 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
significant estimates and assumptions are used for  but not limited to  allowance for doubtful accounts and returns  depreciable lives of fixed assets  estimated lives of our master catalog  and deferred tax asset valuation allowances 
future events and their effects cannot be predicted with certainty  accordingly  our accounting estimates require the exercise of judgment 
the accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements will change as new events occur  as more experience is acquired  as additional information is obtained  and as our operating environment changes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 

table of contents the following table summarizes the more significant expense income transactions in the consolidated statements of operations that require management estimates  which are described below in millions for the years ended march  march  march  provision for doubtful accounts receivables and returns depreciation of property  plant  and equipment amortization of master catalog costs deferred tax asset valuation allowance provisions changes in estimates 
in the ordinary course of accounting for the items discussed above  we make changes in estimates as appropriate and as we become aware of circumstances surrounding those estimates 
such changes and refinements in estimation methodologies are reflected in reported results of operations in the period in which the changes are made and  if material  their effects are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
sales are recorded when products are shipped or services are rendered to customers  as we generally have no significant post delivery obligations 
our prices are fixed and determinable  collection of the resulting receivable is probable  and returns are reasonably estimated 
provisions for customer returns are provided for in the period the related sales are recorded based upon historical data 
we recognize the majority of our service revenue based upon when the calibration or repair activity is performed and then shipped and or delivered to the customer 
some of our service revenue is generated from managing customers calibration programs in which we recognize revenue in equal amounts at fixed intervals 
our shipments are generally free on board shipping point and our customers are generally invoiced for freight  shipping  and handling charges 
accounts receivable 
accounts receivable represent receivables from customers in the ordinary course of business 
these amounts are recorded net of the allowance for doubtful accounts and returns in the consolidated balance sheets 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon the expected collectibility of accounts receivable 
we apply a specific formula to our accounts receivable aging  which may be adjusted on a specific account basis where the formula may not appropriately reserve for loss exposure 
after all attempts to collect a receivable have failed  the receivable is written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the returns reserve is calculated based upon the historical rate of returns applied to sales over a specific timeframe 
the returns reserve will increase or decrease as a result of changes in the level of sales and or the historical rate of returns 
inventory 
inventory consists of finished goods and is valued at the lower of cost or market 
costs are determined using the average cost method of inventory valuation 
inventory is reduced by a reserve for items not saleable at or above cost 
we reserve specifically for certain items of our inventory and  for other items  we apply a specific loss factor  based on historical experience  to specific categories of our inventory 
we evaluate the adequacy of the reserve on a quarterly basis 
properties  depreciation  and amortization 
properties are stated at cost 
depreciation and amortization is computed primarily under the straight line method over the following estimated useful lives years machinery  equipment  and software furniture and fixtures leasehold improvements properties determined to have no value are written off at their then remaining net book value 
we account for software costs in accordance with statement of position no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
leasehold improvements are amortized under the straight line method over the estimated useful life or the lease term  whichever is shorter 
maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred 
see note of our consolidated financial statements for further details 

table of contents goodwill 
we estimate the fair value of our reporting units in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  using the fair market value measurement requirement  rather than the undiscounted cash flows approach 
we test our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  or immediately if conditions indicate that such impairment could exist 
the evaluation of our reporting units on a fair value basis indicated that no impairment existed as of march   march   and march  deferred catalog costs 
we amortize the cost of each master catalog mailed over such catalog s estimated productive life 
we review response results from catalog mailings on a continuous basis  and if warranted  modify the period over which costs are recognized 
we amortize the cost of each master catalog over an eighteen month period and amortize the cost of each catalog supplement over a three month period 
total deferred catalog costs in prepaid expenses and deferred charges on the consolidated balance sheets were million as of march  and million as of march  deferred gain on tpg divestiture 
as a result of certain post divestiture commitments  we are unable to recognize the gain of million on the divestiture of tpg  which took place in fiscal year  until those commitments expire on december  see outlook below in this section and note of our consolidated financial statements for further disclosure 
deferred taxes 
we account for certain income and expense items differently for financial reporting purposes than for income tax reporting purposes 
deferred taxes are provided in recognition of these temporary differences 
a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets is provided for items for which it is more likely than not that the benefit of such items will not be realized  in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
sfas no 
requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when measuring the need for a deferred tax valuation allowance 
see taxes below in this section and note of our consolidated financial statements for further details 
stock options 
we follow the provisions of accounting practice board apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  which does not require compensation costs related to stock options to be recorded in net income  as all options granted under the transcat  inc incentive plan had exercise prices equal to the market value of the underlying common stock at grant date 
see effect of recently issued accounting standards below in this section or note of our consolidated financial statements for our disclosure regarding the effects of sfas r

table of contents outlook we expect the business overall will experience growth in fiscal year similar to that of fiscal year we are planning for revenue growth in the high single digits and improved gross margins resulting from potential leverage on increased calibration services revenues 
distribution products revenues in our direct distribution channel should grow in the mid single digits  assuming a stable economy 
calibration services revenues should grow in the low to mid teens  inclusive of the increase resulting from the acquisition of nwci in february revenue growth in any individual quarter is effected by a number of factors  some beyond our control and others that we can plan for  as detailed in item a above 
increased operating expenses are primarily targeted to support increased revenue growth 
some of our expense increases are necessitated by accounting requirements ie expensing of stock options  which are detailed below 
operating and net earnings will be significantly affected in certain quarters  as discussed below 
a full understanding of these factors is needed to make meaningful comparisons on a quarterly basis to the same period of the previous year 
capital expenditures are planned to be in line with last year s spending 
fiscal year will be affected by a number of factors that should be considered and will be discussed  as appropriate  when evaluating performance 
fiscal year length in april  we changed our fiscal year to a week 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for further disclosure 
fiscal year will be a week year and our fourth quarter will include six weeks 
we do not anticipate the impact on revenue of this extended period to be more than 
nwci in february  we acquired nwci 
see item above and note of the consolidated financial statements for further disclosure 
we anticipate this acquisition will increase calibration services revenue by approximately in fiscal year when compared to fiscal year sfas r in fiscal year  our operating results will reflect the adoption of sfas r  the recognition of expensing stock options 
we anticipate the cost in fiscal year to be approximately million  with the greatest impact in our first quarter as we record the expense associated with unvested outstanding options 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
deferred gain on tpg divestiture in fiscal year  we divested tpg and were precluded from recognizing the gain for accounting purposes until certain conditions were met 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for further disclosure 
we anticipate that those conditions will be met in our third quarter of fiscal year  and therefore we would recognize a non cash gain to operating earnings of million 
income taxes in fiscal year  as a result of the reversal of a significant portion of our deferred tax valuation reserve in fiscal year  we will provide for income taxes on our consolidated statements of operations but will not be required to make any tax payments until we have utilized our net operating loss carryforwards

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates our exposure to changes in interest rates results from borrowing activities 
in the event interest rates were to move by  our yearly interest expense would increase or decrease by less than million assuming our average borrowing levels remained constant 
on march  and march   we had no hedging arrangements in place to limit our exposure to upward movements in interest rates
