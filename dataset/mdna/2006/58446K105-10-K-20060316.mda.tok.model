item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations reference is made to the risk factors for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations and any of our forward looking statements contained herein 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended december   and overview mediacom communications corporation is the nation s eighth largest cable television company based on customers served and the leading cable operator focused on serving the smaller cities and towns in the united states 
through our interactive broadband network  we provide our customers with a wide array of broadband products and services  including analog and digital video services  such as vod  hdtv and dvrs  hsd and phone service 
where our phone service is available  we offer triple play bundles of video  hsd and voice 
bundled products and services offer our customers a single provider contact for ordering  provisioning  billing and customer care 
as of december   our cable systems passed an estimated million homes and served million basic subscribers in states 
we provide digital video services to  digital customers and hsd service to  customers  representing a digital penetration of of our basic subscribers and a data penetration of of our estimated homes passed  respectively 
we introduced telephone service during the second quarter of and provided service to  customers as of december  we have faced increasing levels of competition for our video programming services over the past few years  mostly from dbs providers 
since they have been permitted to deliver local television broadcast signals beginning in  directv  inc and echostar communications corporation  the two largest dbs providers  have been increasing the number of markets in which they deliver these local television signals 
these local into local launches have been the primary cause of our loss of basic subscribers in recent years 
as of december   competitive local into local services in our markets covered an estimated of our basic subscribers 
hurricane losses in and in july and august  as a result of hurricanes dennis and katrina  our cable systems in areas of alabama  florida  and mississippi experienced  to varying degrees  damage to their cable plant and other property and equipment  service interruption and loss of customers 
some of our customers homes in these areas also sustained varying levels of damage  including certain homes in the mississippi area that were totally destroyed 
hurricanes dennis and katrina initially disrupted cable service to about  and  of our basic subscribers  respectively  in these states 
we estimate that the hurricanes initially caused losses of approximately  basic subscribers   digital customers and  data customers 
we are currently capable of providing service to substantially all of the surviving households in the affected communities  and we expect to recover a portion of these lost customers as they return to the region to rebuild or repair their homes 
we anticipate that some customers will move back into their homes or into temporary housing on their properties while repairs or rebuilding are under way  and potentially reconnect or reactivate our service at that time 
as of december   we have not recovered a significant number of these subscribers 
our results of operations for the year ended december   take into account service interruption credits  lost revenues and incremental costs caused by these hurricanes 
revenues for year ended december  reflected approximately million of service interruption credits issued to customers  million of lost revenues from customers whose homes were destroyed or otherwise rendered uninhabitable and million of lost revenue 
table of contents in the advertising sales business 
we also incurred additional service costs of approximately million to cover the repair of our facilities  including increased employee and outside contractor costs  additional selling  general and administrative costs of approximately million related to additional customer service employee costs required to support customers needs  and million of additional depreciation expense due to the impairment of the cable plant and other property and equipment 
capital expenditures to rebuild our cable plant and facilities and restore our service were approximately million for the year ended december  in september  as a result of hurricane ivan  our cable systems in areas of alabama and florida experienced  to varying degrees  damage to cable plant and other property and equipment  service interruption and loss of customers 
the hurricane initially disrupted cable service to over  of our basic subscribers in these two states 
the hurricane caused losses of  basic subscribers   digital customers and  data customers  which were reflected in our subscriber and customer counts as of december  our results of operations for the year ended december   take into account service interruption credits  lost revenues and incremental costs caused by the hurricane 
revenues for the year ended december  reflected approximately million of service interruption credits issued to customers 
we also incurred additional service costs of approximately million to cover the repair of our facilities  including increased employee and outside contractor costs  additional selling  general and administrative costs of approximately million related to additional customer service employee costs required to support customers needs  and million in additional depreciation expense due to the impairment of the cable plant and other property 
capital expenditures to rebuild our cable plant and facilities and restore our service were approximately million and for and  respectively  for hurricane ivan 
we estimate that after december   we may spend more than million to rebuild the remainder of our damaged cable plant and other property assuming the complete recovery of the affected communities  although we cannot be certain about the timing of such spending 
we are insured against certain hurricane related losses  principally damage to our facilities  subject to varying deductible amounts 
we cannot estimate at this time the amounts that will be ultimately recoverable under our insurance policies 
during the fourth quarter of  we received  of insurance proceeds related to hurricane ivan

average monthly date revenue per data subscriber is calculated based on monthly data revenue divided by the average number of data subscribers for each of the twelve months 
video revenues represent monthly subscription fees charged to customers for our core cable television products and services including basic  expanded basic and digital cable programming services  wire maintenance  equipment rental and services to commercial establishments  pay per view charges  installation  reconnection and late payment fees  and other ancillary revenues 
data revenues primarily represent monthly subscription fees charged to customers  including commercial establishments  for our data products and services and equipment rental fees 
revenues rose  largely attributable to an increase in data revenues 
to strengthen our competitiveness  we increased our emphasis on product bundling and on enhancing and differentiating our video products and services with new digital packages  vod  hdtv  dvrs and more local programming 
during  we also extended the discount periods of our promotional campaigns for digital and data services from three and six months to six and twelve months 
this impacted the growth of our video and data revenues 
video revenues increased as a result of the rate increases applied on our subscribers and higher fees from our advanced video products and services  offset in part by the decrease in basic subscribers  including the full year impact of basic subscribers lost in the hurricane  and the effects of promotional activity 
our loss of basic subscribers decreased significantly during  with a loss of  basic subscribers  compared to a loss of  in our loss of basic subscribers in resulted from continuing competitive pressures by other video providers and  to a lesser extent  the impact of hurricanes dennis and katrina 
the average monthly video revenue per basic subscriber increased year over year 
digital customers increased to  from  a year ago 
data revenues rose  primarily due to the year over year increase in data customers  and to a lesser extent  the growth of our commercial service and enterprise network businesses 
average monthly data revenue per data customer decreased as a result of promotional offers during 
table of contents advertising revenues increased and reflected the anticipated decline in political advertising revenues as compared to the election year 
this increase was a result of stronger national and regional advertising and a larger base of homes available to our advertising sales  which came from the interconnection of additional cable systems 
in june  we launched mediacom phone in one of our smaller markets  and as of december   our phone service was marketed to approximately million of our total estimated million homes and served  customers 
we expect to market mediacom phone to approximately million homes by year end costs and expenses service costs include programming expenses  employee expenses related to wages and salaries of technical personnel who maintain our cable network  perform customer installation activities  and provide customer support  data costs  including costs of bandwidth connectivity  customer provisioning  and field operating costs  including outside contractors  vehicle  utilities and pole rental expenses 
programming expenses  which are generally paid on a per subscriber basis  have historically increased due to both increases in the rates charged for existing programming services and the introduction of new programming services to our customers 
service costs rose  primarily due to increases in programming  plant operating and employee costs 
the largest component of service costs is programming expense  which increased as a result of reduced launch support from our programming suppliers in return for our carriage of their services  and higher unit costs charged by them  offset in part by a lower base of basic subscribers 
plant operating costs rose  primarily due to greater use of outside contractors for customer installation activity and  to a lesser extent  higher vehicle fuel costs 
employee costs grew  primarily as a result of increased headcount and overtime of our technical workforce for network phone readiness  customer installation activity and hurricane related repair  offset in part by higher labor and overhead capitalization and reduced employee insurance expenses 
service costs as a percentage of revenues were for the year ended december   as compared with for the year ended december  selling  general and administrative expenses include wages and salaries for our call centers  customer service and support and administrative personnel  franchise fees and taxes  and office costs related to billing  telecommunications  marketing  bad debt  advertising and office administration 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased  principally due to higher employee expenses  marketing costs  and professional fees  offset in part by reduced bad debt expense 
employee costs rose  as a result of increased direct sales personnel  sales commissions and the use of third party call center contractors 
marketing costs grew  due to an increase in costs associated with contracted direct sales personnel and advertising campaigns to support sales of our products and services 
professional fees increased  as a result of higher consulting expenses and other fees 
this increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was partly offset by a decrease in bad debt expense  as a result of improved customer credit and collection policies and better collection experience in our advertising business 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were for the year ended december   as compared with for the year ended december  we expect continued revenue growth in advanced services  which include digital video  hdtv  dvrs  hsd and phone service 
as a result  we expect our service costs and selling  general and administrative expenses to increase 
corporate expenses reflect compensation of corporate employees and other corporate overhead 
corporate expenses rose  primarily due to increases in employee salary and benefit costs  including non cash compensation charges  and higher legal and accounting fees 
corporate expenses as a percentage of revenues were for the year ended december   as compared with for the year ended december  depreciation and amortization increased  primarily due to the retirement of assets and disposals related to hurricane dennis and katrina 

table of contents interest expense  net interest expense  net  increased by  primarily due to higher market interest rates on variable rate debt 
gain on derivatives  net we enter into interest rate exchange agreements  or interest rate swaps  with counterparties to fix the interest rate on a portion of our variable rate debt to reduce the potential volatility in our interest expense that would otherwise result from changes in market interest rates 
as of december   we had interest rate swaps with an aggregate principal amount of million 
the changes in their mark to market values are principally derived from changes in market interest rates and time to maturity 
as a result of the quarterly mark to market valuation of these interest rate swaps  we recorded a gain on derivatives amounting to million for the year ended december   as compared to a gain on derivatives of million for the year ended december  gain on sale of assets and investments  net we recorded a net gain on sale of investments of million for the year ended december   due to the sale of our investment in american independence corporation common stock 
the net gain for the year ended december  was principally due to the sale of a non strategic cable system in may  serving approximately  subscribers  for gross proceeds of about million 
other expense other expense was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
other expense primarily represents amortization of deferred financing costs and fees on unused credit commitments 
provision for income taxes provision for income taxes was approximately million for december   compared to  for the year ended december  during the fourth quarter of  we increased our income tax expense by million as a result of our decision to increase the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  principally relating to our pre tax net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state purposes 
these net operating loss carryforwards had a balance of approximately billion as of december   and if not utilized  will expire in the years through we periodically assess the likelihood of realization of our deferred tax assets  considering all available evidence  both positive and negative  including our results of operations  the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  our forecast of taxable income in future periods and the availability of prudent tax planning strategies 
as a result of these assessments  in prior years we have established valuation allowances on a portion of our deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty surrounding the realization of these assets 
during the fourth quarter of  based on our assessment of the facts and circumstances  we determined that an additional portion of our deferred tax assets from net operating loss carryforwards will not be realized under the more likely than not standard required by sfas no 
as a result  in the fourth quarter of we increased our valuation allowance by approximately million and recognized a corresponding non cash charge to income tax expense 
this amount represents the portion of deferred tax liabilities related to the basis differences of our indefinite lived intangible assets 
our assessment of the facts and circumstances took into account our losses before income taxes in  the reduced likelihood of future taxable income and the limited availability of prudent tax planning strategies 
net loss income as a result of the factors described above  we generated a net loss for the year ended december  of million  as compared to net income of million for the year ended december

average monthly date revenue per data subscriber is calculated based on monthly data revenue divided by the average number of data subscribers for each of the twelve months 
revenues rose  largely attributable to an increase in data customers and basic rate increases applied on our video customers  driven in large part by our own video programming cost increases  offset by a reduction in basic subscribers during the period  including those lost as a result of hurricane ivan 
video revenues rose as a result of the aforementioned basic rate increases  substantially offset by the loss of basic subscribers 
digital customers increased to  as compared to  a year ago 
our loss in basic subscribers resulted primarily from increased competitive pressures by dbs providers  particularly in those markets where we experienced their local into local launches and  to a lesser extent  from our tighter customer credit policies 
data revenues rose  due primarily to a increase in data customers and a higher contribution from our new commercial enterprise business 
advertising revenues increased  primarily as a result of higher political advertising and  to a lesser extent  the completion of an interconnect in one of our larger markets 
political advertising contributed approximately of this increase 
also in  we completed an interconnect agreement  under which we represent other cable operators to jointly sell local advertising  which accounted for of the growth 
costs and expenses service costs rose  primarily due to increases in programming  employee and plant operating costs 
the largest component of service costs is programming expense  which grew as a result of rate increases on basic and premium services  significantly offset by a reduction in basic subscribers and an increase in launch support received from programmers in return for our carriage of their programming services 
employee and plant operating costs grew  primarily due to higher employee benefit costs  insurance claims and the 
table of contents expensing of employee and other operational costs attributed to the continued transition away from network upgrade construction to network maintenance activities 
service costs as a percentage of revenues were for the year ended december   as compared with for the year ended december  selling  general and administrative expenses increased  principally due to higher advertising  marketing  and employee costs  partially offset by a decrease in bad debt expense 
advertising costs grew  as a result of employee commissions on higher advertising revenues 
employee costs rose  as a result of higher employee compensation  benefit costs and customer service overtime  driven by greater call volumes related to the rollout of new products 
marketing costs rose  as a result of media campaigns to support the rollout of new advanced services  and to promote customer retention and acquisition initiatives 
this increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was partly offset by a decrease in bad debt expense  as a result of improved customer credit and collection policies 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were for the year ended december   as compared with for the year ended december  corporate expenses increased  primarily due to higher legal and accounting fees  general insurance expenses and employee costs  offset in part by greater capitalization of labor and overhead costs related to mediacom phone preparation 
corporate expenses as a percentage of revenues were for the year ended december   as compared with for the year ended december  depreciation and amortization decreased  primarily due to changes  effective july   in the estimated useful lives of our cable systems and equipment in conjunction with the completion of our network upgrade and rebuild program  this was offset in part by increased depreciation for investments in our cable network and ongoing investments to continue the rollout of products and services including video on demand  high definition television  digital video recorders and broadband data access 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
interest expense  net interest expense  net  increased by  primarily due to slightly higher market interest rates on variable rate debt and lower interest expense capitalization associated with the substantial reduction of upgrade rebuild capital expenditures  partially offset by lower indebtedness 
gain on derivatives  net as of december  we had interest rate swaps with an aggregate principal amount of million 
the changes in their mark to market values are derived from changes in market interest rates  the decrease in their time to maturity and the creditworthiness of the counterparties 
as a result of the quarterly mark to market valuation of these interest rate swaps  we recorded a gain on derivatives amounting to million for the year ended december   as compared to a gain on derivatives of million for the year ended december  gain loss on sale of assets and investments  net we had a net gain on sale of assets and investments amounting to million for the year ended december  as compared to a loss of million for the year ended december  the net gain was principally due to the sale of a cable system in may  serving approximately  subscribers  for gross proceeds of about million 
other expense other expense was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
other expense primarily represents amortization of deferred financing costs and fees on unused credit commitments 
provision for income taxes provision for income taxes was approximately  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the provision for income taxes relates to state income tax liabilities 

table of contents net income loss as a result of the factors described above  we generated net income for the year ended december  of million  as compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources we have invested  and will continue to invest  in our network to enhance its reliability and capacity  and in the further deployment of advanced broadband services 
our capital spending has recently shifted away from network upgrade investments to the deployment of vod  hdtv  dvrs  hsd and phone services 
we also may continue to make strategic acquisitions of cable systems 
we have a high level of indebtedness and incur significant amounts of interest expense each year 
we believe that we will meet our debt service  capital spending and other requirements through a combination of our net cash flows from operating activities  borrowing availability under our bank credit facilities and our ability to secure future external financing 
as of december   our total debt was billion 
of this amount  million matures within the twelve months ending december  we continue to extend our debt maturities through the refinancing of debt  as discussed below 
during the twelve months ended december   we paid cash interest of million 
our cash interest payments have historically been higher in the first and third calendar quarters of the year due to the timing of the cash interest payments on our senior notes and convertible senior notes 
most of our debt maturing within the twelve months ending december   consists of million of convertible notes due july  although we have not yet determined how we will satisfy that obligation  several alternatives may be available to us  including the repayment of the notes with availability under our subsidiary credit facilities 
as of december   we had unused revolving credit commitments of million  all of which could be borrowed and used for general corporate purposes based on the terms and conditions of our debt arrangements 
description of our credit facilities we own our cable systems through two principal subsidiaries  mediacom llc and mediacom broadband llc 
the operating subsidiaries of mediacom llc llc group have a billion bank credit facility the llc credit facility expiring in  of which million was outstanding as of december  the llc credit facility consists of a million revolving credit commitment  a million delayed draw term loan  and a million term loan 
the operating subsidiaries of mediacom broadband llc broadband group have a billion bank credit facility the broadband credit facility expiring in  of which million was outstanding as of december  the broadband credit facility consists of a million revolving credit commitment  a million term loan and a million term loan 
for all periods through december   we were in compliance with all of the covenants under our debt arrangements 
continued access to our credit facilities is subject to our remaining in compliance with the covenants of these credit facilities  including covenants tied to our operating performance 
we believe that we will not have any difficulty in the foreseeable future complying with these covenants and that we will meet our current and long term debt service  capital spending and other cash requirements through a combination of our net cash flows from operating activities  borrowing availability under our bank credit facilities and our ability to secure future external financing 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain sufficient future financing  or  if we were able to do so  that the terms would be favorable to us 
we expect that we will continue to be able to generate funds and obtain financing sufficient to service our long term business plan  service our debt obligations and complete any future acquisitions if the opportunities arise 
we have entered into interest rate exchange agreements  which expire from july through june  to fix the interest rate on million of floating rate debt 
primarily in the fourth quarter of  million of these interest rate exchange agreements are scheduled to expire 
under the terms of all of our interest rate exchange agreements  we are exposed to credit 
table of contents loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements 
however  due to the high creditworthiness of our counterparties  which are major banking firms with investment grade ratings  we do not anticipate their nonperformance 
as of december   about of our outstanding indebtedness was at fixed interest rates or subject to interest rate protection 
the average interest rate for borrowings under the revolving commitments of our credit facilities is now libor plus 
as of december   approximately million of letters of credit were issued to various parties to secure our performance relating to insurance and franchise requirements 
operating activities net cash flows provided by operating activities were million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the prior year 
the change of million is primarily due to a net decrease in operating assets and liabilities  an increase in cash paid for interest and lower operating income before depreciation and amortization 
the change in operating assets and liabilities was lower by million due to the timing of our cash payments and cash receipts 
we made cash interest payments of million and million in and  respectively 
this increase was a result of higher interest rates on our variable rate debt 
operating income before depreciation and amortization decreased million mainly from higher costs  offset in part by an increase in revenues 
investing activities net cash flows used in investing activities were million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the prior year  and principally comprised capital expenditures 
capital expenditures increased million to million mainly due to greater levels of customer connection activities 
purchases of customer premise equipment  including greater quantities of higher cost hdtv and dvr set tops  and installation costs were the principal components of our capital investment related to customer connection activities 
during  we expect to incur million of capital expenditures 
financing activities net cash flows provided by financing activities were million for the year ended december   as compared to net cash flows used in financing activities of million for prior year 
in  our principal financing activities included the following in january  llc group borrowed the full amount of its million delayed draw term loan facility and used the proceeds to reduce outstanding balances under its revolving credit facility 
in april  we redeemed all of our senior notes due april the redemption price was equal to of the outstanding principal amount of the notes  plus accrued interest 
we funded the redemption with a combination of cash on hand and borrowings under llc group s revolving credit facility 
in may  broadband group refinanced its term loan with a new term loan in the amount of million 
borrowings under the new term loan bear interest at a rate that is less than the interest rate of the term loan it replaced 
the new term loan matures in february  whereas the term loan it replaced had a maturity of september in august  we issued million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due october the senior notes due 
the senior notes due are unsecured obligations of mediacom broadband llc  and the indenture governing the senior notes due stipulates  among other things  restrictions on incurrence of indebtedness  distributions  mergers and asset sales and has cross default provisions related to other debt of mediacom broadband llc 
the proceeds from this offering were used to reduce the outstanding balances under broadband group s revolving credit facility 
in october  the broadband credit facility was amended i to increase the revolving credit commitment portion from approximately million to approximately million  of which approximately million is not subject to scheduled reductions prior to the termination date  and ii to extend the termination date of the commitments not subject to reductions from march to december 
table of contents pursuant to our board authorized repurchase program  we repurchased approximately million shares of our class a common stock for approximately million during the year ended december  contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commercial commitments  and the effects they are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow  for the five years subsequent to december  and thereafter dollars in thousands capital operating interest debt leases leases expense total thereafter total cash obligations refer to note to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our long term debt  and to note for a discussion of our operating leases and other commitments and contingencies

critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
periodically  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to doubtful accounts  long lived assets  capitalized costs and accruals 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the application of the critical accounting policies discussed below requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management 
for a summary of our accounting policies  see note of our consolidated financial statements 
property  plant and equipment we capitalize the costs of new construction and replacement of our cable transmission and distribution facilities and new cable service installations 
capitalized costs include all direct labor and materials as well as certain indirect costs 
capitalized costs are recorded as additions to property  plant and equipment and depreciate over the life of the related asset 
we perform periodic evaluations of the estimates used to determine the amount of costs that are capitalized 
any changes to these estimates  which may be significant  are applied in the period in which the evaluations were completed 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the liability method as stipulated by sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this method generally provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities and anticipated benefit of utilizing net operating loss carryforwards 

table of contents in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets and net operating loss carryforwards we assess all available positive and negative evidence including our most recent performance  the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  our forecast of taxable income in future periods and available prudent tax planning strategies 
in forecasting future taxable income we use assumptions that require significant judgment and are consistent with the estimates we use to manage our business 
during the fourth quarter of  we increased our valuation allowance against deferred tax assets by million and recognized a corresponding non cash charge to the provision for income taxes 
at december   the valuation allowance had a balance of approximately million 
we will continue to monitor the need for the deferred tax asset valuation allowance in accordance with sfas no 
we expect to add to our valuation allowance any increase in deferred tax liabilities relating to indefinite lived intangible assets 
we will also adjust our valuation allowance if we assess that there is sufficient change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets 
our income tax expense in future periods will be reduced or increased to the extent of offsetting decreases or increases  respectively  in our valuation allowance 
these changes could have a significant impact on our future earnings 
indefinite lived intangibles our cable systems operate under non exclusive franchises granted by state and local governmental authorities for varying lengths of time 
we acquired these cable franchises through acquisitions of cable systems and were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
we have concluded that our cable franchise rights have an indefinite useful life since  among other things  there are no legal  regulatory  contractual  competitive  economic or other factors limiting the period over which these cable franchise rights contribute to our revenues 
accordingly  with our adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we no longer amortize the cable franchise rights and other indefinite lived assets 
instead  such assets are tested annually for impairment or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
based on the guidance outlined in eitf no 
 unit of accounting for testing impairment of indefinite lived intangible assets  we determined that the unit of accounting for testing franchise value for impairment resides at a cable system cluster level 
such level reflects the financial reporting level managed and reviewed by the corporate office ie  chief operating decision maker as well as how we allocated capital resources and utilize the assets 
lastly  the unit reporting level reflects the level at which the purchase method of accounting for our acquisitions was originally recorded 
we have three cable system clusters  or reporting units  for the purpose of applying sfas no 
we follow the provisions of sfas no 
to test our goodwill and certain other intangible assets for impairment 
we assess fair values primarily using discounted cash flow methodology 
goodwill impairment is determined using a two step process 
the first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill  calculated using the residual method  with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value  the excess is recognized as an impairment loss 
the impairment test for other intangible assets not subject to amortization consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value 
if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value  the excess is recognized as an impairment loss 
we completed our most recent impairment test as of october   which reflected no impairment of our franchise rights and goodwill 
our use of discounted cash flow analyses in determining the fair value of each cable system cluster involves certain assumptions and estimates  which are consistent with the expectations of buyers and sellers of cable systems in determining fair value 
significant impairment in value resulting in impairment charges may result if these estimates and assumptions used in the fair value determination change in the future 
such impairments could potentially be material 

table of contents derivatives we account for derivative instruments in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
 and sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
our primary objective for holding derivative financial instruments is to manage interest rate risk 
our derivative instruments are recorded at fair value and are included in other current assets  other assets and other liabilities 
our accounting policies for these instruments are based on whether they meet our criteria for designation as hedging transactions  which include the instrument s effectiveness in risk reduction and  in most cases  a one to one matching of the derivative instrument to its underlying transaction 
we have no derivative financial instruments designated as hedges 
gains and losses from changes in the mark to market values are currently recognized in the consolidated statement of operations 
short term valuation changes derived from changes in market interest rates  time to maturity and the creditworthiness of the counterparties may increase the volatility of earnings 
programming costs we have various fixed term carriage contracts to obtain programming for our cable systems from content suppliers whose compensation is generally based on a fixed monthly fee per customer 
these programming contracts are subject to negotiated renewal 
we recognize programming costs when we distribute the related programming 
these programming costs are usually payable each month based on calculations performed by us and are subject to adjustments based on the results of periodic audits by the content suppliers 
historically  these audit adjustments have been immaterial to our total programming costs  however  there can be no assurance that such adjustments will be immaterial in the future 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  amendment of statement on share based payment 
sfas no 
r is supplemented by sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 share based payment 
sab no 
expresses the sec staff s views regarding the interaction between sfas no 
r and certain sec rules and regulations including the valuation of share based payment arrangements 
sfas no 
r requires companies to expense the value of employee stock options  stock granted through the employee stock purchase program and similar awards 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
we will adopt sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method effective january  on the effective date of sfas r  compensation costs will be recognized  i for all share based payments granted after the effective date and  ii for all awards granted prior to the effective date that remain unvested 
we expect that the adoption of sfas no 
r will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and earnings per share 
in march  the fasb issued fin as an interpretation of sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this interpretation clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in sfas  refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity
