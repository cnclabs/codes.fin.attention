overview we provide strategic consulting applications services  technology solutions and managed services to government organizations  global companies and medium sized businesses in the united states and internationally 
in north america  we provide consulting services through our public services  commercial services and financial services industry groups in which we focus significant industry specific knowledge and service offerings to our clients 
outside of north america  we are organized on a geographic basis  with operations in emea  the asia pacific region and latin america 
beginning in  we intend to begin transitioning our business to a more integrated  global delivery model 
this transition will begin by more closely aligning our senior personnel worldwide who have significant industry specific expertise with our existing north american public services  commercial services and financial services industry groups 
our non managing director employees will then be assigned  as needed  across all of our industry specific operations 
we expect this change to improve our utilization and provide added training for our professional personnel 
economic and industry factors we believe that our clients spending for consulting services is partially correlated to  among other factors  the performance of the domestic and global economy as measured by a variety of indicators such as gross domestic product  government policies  mergers and acquisitions activity  corporate earnings  us federal and state government budget levels  inflation and interest rates and client confidence levels  among others 
as economic uncertainties increase  clients interests in business and technology consulting historically have turned more to improving existing processes and reducing costs rather than investing in new innovations 
demand for our services  as evidenced by new contract bookings  also does not uniformly follow changes in economic cycles 
consequently  we may experience rapid decreases in new contract bookings at the onset of significant economic downturns while the benefits of economic recovery may take longer to realize 
the markets in which we provide services are increasingly competitive and global in nature 
while supply and demand in certain lines of business and geographies may support price increases for some of our standard service offerings from time to time  to maintain and improve our profitability we must constantly seek to improve and expand our unique service offerings and deliver our services at increasingly lower cost levels 
our public services industry group  which is our largest  also must operate within the us federal  state and local government markets where unique contracting  budgetary and regulatory regimes control how contracts are awarded  modified and terminated 
budgetary constraints or reductions in government funding may result in the modification or termination of long term government contracts  which could dramatically affect the outlook of that business 
revenue and income drivers we derive substantially all of our revenue from professional services activities 
our revenue is driven by our ability to continuously generate new opportunities to serve clients  by the prices we obtain for our service offerings  and by the size and utilization of our professional workforce 
our ability to generate new business is directly influenced by the economic conditions in the industries and regions we serve  our anticipation and response to technological change  the type and level of technology spending by our clients and by our clients perception of the quality of our work 
our ability to generate new business is also indirectly and increasingly influenced by our clients perceptions of our ability to manage our ongoing issues surrounding our financial accounting  internal controls and sec reporting capabilities 
our gross profit is predominantly a function of the factors affecting revenue mentioned above and how well we manage our costs of services 
the primary components of our costs of services include professional compensation and other direct contract expenses 
professional compensation consists of payroll costs and related benefits associated with client service professional staff including the vesting of rsus  tax equalization for employees on foreign and long term domestic assignments and costs associated with reductions in workforce 
other direct contract expenses include costs directly attributable to client engagements 
these costs include out of pocket costs such as travel and subsistence for client service professional staff  costs of hardware and software  and costs of subcontractors 
if we are unable to adequately control or estimate these costs  or properly anticipate the sizes of our client service and support staff  our profitability will suffer 
our operating profit reflects our revenue less costs of services and certain additional items that include  primarily  selling  general and administrative sg a expenses  which include costs related to marketing  information systems  depreciation and amortization  finance and accounting  human resources  sales force  and other expenses related to managing and growing our business 
write downs in the carrying value of goodwill and amortization of intangible assets have also reduced our operating profit 
our operating cash flow is predominantly a function of the factors affecting gross profits mentioned above and our ability to manage our receivables and payables and efficiently manage our sources of capital and use of these various sources of capital 
key performance indicators in evaluating our financial condition and operating performance  we focus on the following key performance indicators bookings  revenue growth  operating margin gross profit as a percentage of revenue  utilization  days sales outstanding  free cash flow and attrition 
bookings 
we believe that information regarding our new contract bookings provides useful trend information regarding how the volume of our new business changes over time 
information regarding our new bookings should not be compared to  or substituted for  an analysis of our revenue over time 
there are no third party standards or requirements governing the calculation of bookings 
new contract bookings are recorded using then existing currency exchange rates and are not subsequently adjusted for currency fluctuations 
these amounts represent our estimate at contract signing of the net revenue expected over the term of that contract and involve estimates and judgments regarding new contracts as well as renewals  extensions and additions to existing contracts 
subsequent cancellations  extensions and other matters may affect the amount of bookings previously reported 
bookings do not include potential revenue that could be earned from a client relationship as a result of future expansion of service offerings to that client  nor does it reflect option years under contracts that are subject to client discretion 
although our level of bookings provides some an indication of how our business is performing  we do not characterize our bookings  or our engagement contracts associated with new bookings  as backlog because our engagements generally can be cancelled or terminated on short notice or without notice 
revenue growth 
unlike bookings  which provide only a general sense of future expectations  period over period comparisons of revenue provide a meaningful depiction of how successful we have been in growing our business over time 
gross margin gross profit as a percentage of revenue 
gross margin is a meaningful tool for monitoring our ability to control costs 
analysis of the various cost elements  including foreign currency translation adjustments and the use of subcontractors  as a percentage of revenue over time can provide additional information as to the key challenges we are facing in executing our business model 
the cost of subcontractors is generally more expensive than the cost of our own workforce and can negatively impact our gross profit 
while the use of subcontractors can help us to win larger  more complex deals  and also may be mandated by our clients  we focus on limiting the use of subcontractors whenever possible in order to minimize our costs 
utilization 
utilization represents the percentage of time our consultants are performing work that is chargeable to a client  and is defined as total hours charged to client engagements divided by total available hours for any specific time period 
in  we modified the calculation to include the available hours of employees working on non chargeable internal projects that had a general relationship to client matters  which will have the effect of lowering our reported utilization figure by an insignificant amount 
we also plan to further modify this calculation in by excluding the holiday and paid vacation time for our employees from the available hours figure 
this will have the effect of raising the utilization rate but will make our reporting of this metric more consistent with how we believe our industry peer group measures utilization 
days sales outstanding dso 
dso is an operational metric that approximates the amount of earned revenue that remains unpaid by clients at a given time 
dsos are derived by dividing the sum of our outstanding accounts receivable and unbilled revenue  less deferred revenue  by our average net revenue per day 
average net revenue per day is determined by dividing total net revenue for the most recently ended trailing twelve month period divided by free cash flow 
free cash flow is calculated by subtracting purchases of property and equipment from cash provided by operating activities 
we believe free cash flow is a useful measure because it allows better understanding and assessment of our ability to meet debt service requirements and the amount of recurring cash generated from operations after expenditures for fixed assets 
free cash flow does not represent the company s residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures as it excludes certain mandatory expenditures such as repayment of maturing debt 
we use free cash flow as a measure of recurring operating cash flow 
free cash flow is a non gaap financial measure 
the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap is net cash provided by operating activities 
attrition 
attrition  or voluntary total employee turnover  is calculated by dividing the number of our employees who have chosen to leave the company within a certain period by the total average number of all employees during that same period 
previously  we had provided attrition figures for our billable employees and did not take into account our non consultant employees 
starting in  we intend to provide attrition figures for all of our employees  which we believe provides metrics that are more compatible with  and comparable to  those of our competitors 
readers should understand that each of the performance indicators identified above are utilized by many companies in our industry and by those who follow our industry 
there are no uniform standards or requirements for computing these performance indicators  and  consequently  our computations of these amounts may not be comparable to those of our competitors 
fiscal highlights in fiscal  we continued to face many of the challenges that negatively affected our performance in fiscal while our core business delivered results generally consistent with fiscal and we achieved success in addressing some challenges  much remains to be done  particularly with respect to the process  training and system issues related to financial accounting for our north american operations and the remediation of material weaknesses in our internal controls 
new contract bookings for fiscal were  million  a slight increase over new contract bookings of  million for fiscal new contract bookings increased in all three industry groups in north america  driven primarily by strong bookings in our financial services industry group  which offset decreased bookings in the emea  asia pacific and latin america regions 
new contract bookings for the nine months ended september  were approximately  million  compared with new contract bookings of  million for the nine months ended september  our revenue for fiscal was  million  representing an increase of million  or  over fiscal revenue of  million 
our gross profit for fiscal was million compared to million for fiscal gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased to during fiscal from during fiscal this decrease was primarily attributable to compensation expense of million related to the vesting of certain restricted stock units and a million loss recognized on the ht contract  each of which is described below 
we have a significant contract the ht contract with hawaiian telcom communications  inc  a telecommunications industry client  under which we were engaged to design  build and operate various information technology systems for the client 
we incurred losses of million under this contract in fiscal the ht contract has experienced delays in its build and deployment phases and contractual milestones have been missed 
the client has alleged that we are responsible under the ht contract to compensate it for certain costs and other damages incurred as a result of these delays and other alleged failures 
we believe the client s nonperformance of its responsibilities under the ht contract caused delays in the project and impacted our ability to perform  thereby causing us to incur significant damages 
we also believe the terms of the ht contract limit the client s ability to recover certain of their claimed damages 
we are negotiating with the client to resolve these issues  apportion financial responsibility for these costs and alleged damages  and transition remaining work under the ht contract to others  as requested by the client 
during these negotiations  we are maintaining all of our options  including disputing the client s claims and asserting our own claims in litigation 
at this time we cannot predict the likelihood that we will be able to resolve this dispute or the outcome of any litigation that might ensue if we are unable to resolve the dispute 
even if resolved  we could incur substantial additional losses under the ht contract or agree to pay additional amounts to facilitate termination of the ht contract 
the incurrence of additional losses or the payment of additional amounts to the client could materially and adversely affect our profitability  results of operations or cash flow over the near term 
for fiscal  all of the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting cited for fiscal remain 
for information on the developments and progress made in fiscal  please see item a  controls and procedures remediation of material weaknesses in internal control over financing reporting 
we incurred selling  general and administrative expenses of million in  primarily attributable to our finance accounting department 
the primary contributor for the increase in this amount over fiscal were costs for sub contracted labor and other costs directly related to the issuance of our financial statements for fiscal years and due to the continuing material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting  we continue to experience significant delays in completing our consolidated financial statements and filing periodic reports with the sec on a timely basis 
consequently  we continue to devote substantial additional internal and external resources  and incur significantly higher than expected fees for audit services  in connection with completing our consolidated financial statements and restating our consolidated financial statements for prior years 
during fiscal  we incurred external costs related to these efforts of approximately million  compared to approximately million for fiscal we expect our costs for fiscal through december  related to these efforts to be approximately million 
in fiscal  we realized a net loss of million  or a loss of per share  compared to a net loss of million  or a loss of per share  in fiscal included in our results for fiscal were a million goodwill impairment charge  million of operating losses related to the ht contract  million of non cash compensation expense related to the vesting of rsus  a million increase in the valuation allowance primarily against our us deferred tax assets  and million of lease and facilities restructuring charges 
during fiscal  we benefited from the continued improvement of key economic conditions in north america and increased spending on consulting services in strategically important markets  particularly within our public services and financial services industry groups 
we also saw stabilization and or improvement in key economic indicators in our international markets as well  particularly in europe 
utilization for fiscal was  as compared with in fiscal we believe that utilization levels in fiscal were affected  in part  by the demands placed on many of our consulting professionals to assist in preparing contracts to determine appropriate revenue recognition in light of the company s material weaknesses relating to revenue recognition processes 
utilization for the nine months ended september  based on the same method of calculation utilized for fiscal was 
in partial response to lower utilization rates  we rebalanced our workforce and recorded million in charges for severance and termination benefits 
at december   our dsos stood at days  representing a decrease of days  or  from our dsos at december  given our ongoing systems issues related to financial accounting for our north american operations  we are currently unable to calculate dsos for dates later than december  we continue to focus on this metric during as we believe we are at a dso level that is higher than the industry average  resulting in a suboptimal use of our cash 
free cash flow for fiscal was million 
net cash used in operating activities in fiscal was million 
purchases of property and equipment in were million 
when this amount is subtracted from net cash used in operating activities  the result is million  which is free cash flow 
we use free cash flow as a measure of recurring operating cash flow 
free cash flow is a non gaap financial measure 
the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap is net cash provided by used in operating activities 
given our ongoing systems issues related to financial accounting for our north american operations  we currently are unable to calculate free cash flow for dates later than december  we expect our operating activities to use  rather than provide a source of  cash in fiscal we have also budgeted up to million for purchases of property and equipment in fiscal which  if utilized  will place further demands on our cash 
our estimated cash balance net of float as of september  was approximately million  which includes approximately million of accumulated contributions under the espp 
in  we made great efforts to retain our best people in the face of the turbulence surrounding the restatement of certain of our prior years financial statements  publicity regarding changes in our management  issues surrounding our financial reporting and material weaknesses in our internal controls 
during fiscal  we granted approximately million retention rsus net of forfeitures under our ltip to our managing directors and other key employees 
these grants were made to better align the interests of these employees with our shareholders and to enhance the retention of our managing directors 
in fiscal we recorded non cash stock compensation expense of million related to the vesting of retention rsus  which significantly impacted both our gross profit and operating income for that fiscal year 
for more information on these programs  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview and note  stockholders equity  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
as of december   we had approximately  full time employees  including approximately  consulting professionals  which represented an increase in our billable headcount of approximately over fiscal as of september   we had approximately  full time employees  including approximately  consulting professionals 
our voluntary  annualized attrition rate for fiscal was  compared to for fiscal we believe that attrition levels in fiscal were affected  in part  by the demands placed on many of our consulting professionals to assist in preparing contracts for review in connection with our financial closing process 
while we expect the volume of these demands to decrease in fiscal  we need to improve how we support this effort without placing undue burdens on our consulting professionals 
our voluntary  annualized attrition rate for the nine months ended september  was 
since february  our management team has been significantly restructured  with of members having been replaced  including the chief executive officer  chief financial officer and general counsel 
in a highly competitive market  we believe client satisfaction is an important indicator of a company s ability to sustain strong relationships with key accounts 
each year  forrester research  inc conducts a survey of end users regarding their it services buying plans  including client satisfaction 
in forrester s july it services scorecard for us business and it decision makers  we led in terms of customer satisfaction among the consulting and systems integration firms mentioned with a score of based on a scale of to 
in its may report  we continued to score positively with the end users of it services with a score of 
in may  the us defense contract audit agency dcaa issued a report on its audit of our control environment and overall accounting systems controls  which audit began in fiscal the dcaa report concluded that our accounting system was inadequate in part  meaning that our system is adequate for government contracting  with the exception of certain items known as condition statements 
the dcaa report contained four condition statements  the most material of which related to our failure to timely file our periodic reports with the sec 
the remaining three condition statements have been significantly or completely remediated 
dcaa audits are periodic and ongoing 
we expect that after the filing of this annual report on form k  the dcaa will audit our controls again and review the previously cited condition statements 
during fiscal  we completed a number of private securities offerings in an effort to improve our overall liquidity 
we issued an additional million aggregate principal amount of our series a debentures and million aggregate principal amount of our series b debentures 
we also issued an aggregate principal amount of million of our april senior debentures and an aggregate principal amount of million of our july senior debentures 
in total  we received approximately million in net proceeds from all of these offerings 
for additional information regarding our debt restructuring  see liquidity and capital resources and note  notes payable  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
on october   moody s downgraded our corporate family rating to b from b and the ratings for two of our subordinated convertible bonds series to b from b  and placed our ratings on review for further downgrade 
separately  on april   standard poor s downgraded our senior unsecured rating to b from bb with negative implications 
these downgrades by moody s and standard poor s followed downgrades by each of the rating agencies on december  and march and  principal business goals and challenges for and beyond our principal business goals and challenges for and beyond are focused on resolving the issues related to our financial reporting and processes  strengthening our business model  addressing human resources issues and strengthening our existing compliance framework 
financial reporting and processes 
our top priorities with respect to financial reporting and process issues have been to resolve the process  training and system issues related to financial accounting for our north america operations and to focus on the remediation of material weaknesses in our internal controls identified as part of management s review and evaluation of internal control over financial reporting 
successful resolution of these issues will help us to file our periodic reports with the sec on a timely basis  including form k and forms q 
in addition  we expect that the resolution of these issues will improve our billings and cash collections procedures and result in improved cash flow 
notwithstanding our efforts to accelerate the pace of development work needed to globalize our financial reporting systems  we currently do not anticipate becoming fully current in our periodic filings with the sec before late spring of  at the earliest 
because the financial systems in each of our geographic regions operate on their own it platforms  we will be making significant investments in fiscal years and to more closely integrate these systems and to reduce future sg a costs 
given the time necessary to analyze various alternatives and implement a solution  significant additional costs related to the transformation of our financial reporting systems likely will be required through fiscal we currently expect these additional costs to be in the range of million in fiscal with an additional million to follow in our goal continues to be to establish and maintain adequate internal controls over our financial reporting  however  our challenges remain significant and we cannot be certain this goal will be achieved 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal we began to implement  and throughout fiscal the company deployed  a significant program control function  currently consisting of approximately professionals  designed to support the completeness and accuracy of project accounting details in north america 
this function is designed to build effective financial controls into the lifecycle of a contract supporting the timely assembly and review of revenue  engagement close out and other contract cost elements as part of our daily operations 
the success of this function will depend on a number of factors  including our ability to attract and retain qualified finance professionals  the implementation of an effective control environment over client contract accounting and the development of financial systems to support the function 
strengthen our business model 
we must continuously seek to strengthen our business model in order to improve our competitive position and financial results 
our actions in fiscal will continue to include improving our service offerings and go to market strategy 
we will continue to increase our investment in the development of superior solutions and insights  while working to improve our relationships with more senior and influential decision makers 
in fiscal  we established the bearingpoint institute for executive insight to advance our thought leadership and facilitate the development of premium  higher margin services 
in fiscal  we have started focusing our efforts and our resources devoted to developing  capturing and protecting re usable intellectual property  methodologies and tools in a more disciplined fashion that will bring more value to our clients and increase our earnings from these important assets 
focusing on reducing our dsos and improving operating cash flow 
in order to achieve a meaningful reduction in dsos  we have focused on this metric at all leadership levels of the company and are working to increase the functionality of and training on financial systems to aid in the prompt generation of client invoices and account aging schedules 
we have also modified the compensation structure of our senior managers and managing directors to include dsos as a measure of performance 
reducing dsos will improve our operating cash flow which will help to improve our credit rating  reduce our reliance on external borrowings and  potentially  increase our capacity to obtain performance and surety bonds and letters of credit needed to support our state and local contracting practices within our public services industry group 
given our ongoing systems issues related to financial accounting for our north american operations  we are currently unable to compute dsos for dates later than december  recognizing that our dso levels are higher than industry averages  each of our business units has assembled teams of senior personnel who will specifically focus on accelerating the collection of each business unit s largest outstanding client balances in an effort to further reduce our dsos for fiscal improving engagement profitability 
early in fiscal  we conducted a comprehensive portfolio review to assess the profitability of our services across our global business 
based on the results of this work  in fiscal we are increasing our focus on projects that are larger and more profitable in nature and standardizing our approach to smaller projects so as to either increase their profitability or avoid adding them to our portfolio 
winning larger  more complex projects generally requires more business development costs and time 
in the near term  our interest in pursuing more larger  complex projects and relatively fewer smaller ones could impact our utilization and selling  general and administrative expenses 
we are continuing efforts  begun in fiscal  to reduce our presence and or rationalize our operations in certain non core and under performing business areas 
we are devoting significant attention to developing clear and specific operations procedures to be utilized within our industry groups and reinforcing deal review procedures to review significant proposals and contracts for a number of factors  including profitability and engagement risk 
improving the management of projects and reducing the cost of delivery 
we are leveraging our workforce more effectively by improving the managing director to staff ratio on projects  while increasing the use of lower cost resources both offshore china and india and domestically hattiesburg  mississippi to support engagement work 
we are implementing stricter criteria concerning the use of subcontractors in an effort to reduce our use of subcontractors and drive greater utilization of internal resources 
reducing the cost and improving the quality of our corporate services 
in an effort to reduce our sg a costs and improve service levels  in fiscal we launched a comprehensive review of all corporate services  including our finance support  real estate and occupancy  information technology  human resources  marketing and other functions 
we are aggressively exploring cost reduction opportunities to move non core administrative activities offshore  and we continue to make progress against our previously announced office space reduction program in order to reduce real estate costs 
in early fiscal  we essentially completed the transition of infrastructure and support services that were provided by kpmg 
see note  commitments and contingencies  and note  related party transactions  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
human resources 
it is imperative that we continue efforts to improve the quality of our management and to enhance the attractiveness of career opportunities at bearingpoint while addressing supply and demand imbalances in various business areas and geographies that continue to contribute to sub optimal financial performance 
people initiatives we are taking actions to raise the quality of our managing directors and are implementing a new compensation structure tied to new metrics to better evaluate managing director performance and to link rewards and advancement to accountability and corporate performance 
historically  our business model has rewarded revenue growth and utilization rather than profitability and we believe we must change this approach if we are to be successful  particularly among our managing directors 
we want to continue to encourage non managing director employee stock ownership and raise our levels of employee ownership to more appropriately align the interests of our employees with those of our shareholders 
our inability to issue freely tradable shares of our common stock under our espp continues to hinder these goals 
however  we estimate that issuances of rsus in fiscal years and will eventually raise the levels of employee ownership from approximately to approximately of our total shares outstanding when and if all of these rsus vest 
during fiscal  we granted approximately million rsus net of forfeitures 
however  the near term value of our equity incentives remains uncertain  as we have not settled any rsus or completed any stock purchases under our espp and will not  until we are current in our sec filings 
as of september   we had only million shares remaining available for award under our ltip 
upon reaching that limit  we will be unable to make further equity awards until we have first obtained the consent of our shareholders at an annual meeting of our shareholders 
for more information on these rsu grants and our be an owner program  see business employees 
structural challenges we learned  through a comprehensive review of corporate services and project management initiatives conducted in fiscal  that we must become more efficient and coordinated in our efforts to recruit  train and utilize our professional services staff 
historically  we have faced challenges associated with transitioning employees from completed projects to new engagements  forecasting demand for our services  maintaining an appropriately balanced and sized workforce  and managing attrition 
our current staffing and  hence  recruiting efforts are managed on an industry group basis 
we must continue to focus on improving both the processes and systems surrounding recruiting individuals with the right skill sets and globally staffing client engagements in the most efficient manner 
we are beginning to implement firm wide systems and procedures to provide better and more accurate knowledge of the demand for our skills and our ability to recruit and staff this demand efficiently by more closely aligning our senior personnel worldwide with our three industry specific industry groups 
when combined with more robust training opportunities and venues for our employees  a goal we have established for fiscal  we hope these efforts will improve both our utilization and workforce retention levels 
while we have made significant progress in more efficiently restructuring the composition of our employee workforce and delivery models  we must expand these efforts beyond to cover our operations in the asia pacific and emea regions 
the speed with which we can complete these efforts will be affected by the existence of rigid labor and employment law regimes  particularly in several significant european markets 
strengthen our compliance framework 
in fiscal  our board of directors commissioned management to inventory and coordinate all of its existing corporate policies and procedures 
in response to this directive  we formed a policies and procedures program management office pmo 
the pmo was created to achieve three objectives establish clear authorship and ownership of global policies and procedures  establish a central repository of documents that would facilitate and enhance policies and procedures accessibility to our employees globally  and create a tool method for  and manage the process of  creating new and revising existing documents 
in the first half of  we hired a new general counsel and chief compliance officer  each with significant prior regulatory and compliance experience 
under the direction of the general counsel  outside counsel was retained to conduct an extensive audit of the state of the significant corporate level and government contracting related policies that we have in place 
in  we expect to expend additional funds and resources to execute on the findings of this audit  which will include restructuring and centralizing our compliance efforts under our chief compliance officer 
the chief compliance officer will report to our general counsel during this development phase  and focus on creating a more extensive  uniform  global approach to monitoring  reporting and remediating any shortcomings or infractions of critical corporate compliance policies and procedures 
these efforts are in addition to  and not in lieu of  our work towards improving our internal control over financial reporting 
segments our reportable segments for fiscal consist of our three north america industry groups public services  commercial services  and financial services  our three international regions emea  asia pacific and latin america and the corporate other category which consists primarily of infrastructure costs 
revenue and gross profit information about our segments are presented below  starting with each of our industry groups and then with each of our three international regions in order of size 
our chief operating decision maker  the chief executive officer  evaluates performance and allocates resources among the segments 
accounting policies of our segments are the same as those described in note  summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
upon consolidation  all intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated 
inter segment revenue is not included in the measure of profit or loss for each reportable segment 
performance of the segments is evaluated on operating income excluding the costs of infrastructure functions such as information systems  finance and accounting  human resources  legal and marketing as described in note  segment information  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
during fiscal  we combined our communications  content and utilities and consumer  industrial and technology industry groups to form the commercial services industry group 
beginning in  we intend to begin transitioning our business to a more integrated  global delivery model 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue 
our revenue for fiscal was  million  an increase of million  or  over fiscal revenue of  million 
the following tables present certain revenue information and performance metrics for each of our reportable segments during fiscal years and amounts are in thousands  except percentages 
for additional geographical revenue information  please see note  segment information  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
year ended december  change change revenue public services commercial services financial services emea asia pacific latin america corporate other   n m total impact of revenue growth currency decline  net of fluctuations currency impact total revenue public services commercial services financial services emea asia pacific latin america corporate other n m n m n m total n m not meaningful public services revenue decreased in fiscal  primarily attributable to expected reductions of million in revenue derived from our subcontractors and resales of procured materials which we must bill our clients  thereby increasing our revenue and revenue reductions of million associated with two loss contracts  both of which more than offset increases in headcount and chargeable hours resulting from our expanding use of employees at lower average bill rates 
commercial services revenue increased in fiscal  primarily driven by revenue growth with transportation clients and a significant contract with hawaiian telcom communications  inc  which was partially offset by revenue declines from certain of our clients in the manufacturing and high tech industries 
financial services revenue increased in fiscal  primarily due to revenue growth in all sectors  with especially strong growth in the insurance and global market sectors 
revenue growth was principally due to an increase in demand for our services 
our average billing rates improved slightly year over year  as our ability to obtain higher rates per hour on certain of our market offerings offset the increasing use of lower priced offshore personnel as a component of our overall pricing model 
emea revenue increased in fiscal  primarily due to combined revenue growth in france and the united kingdom of million  partially offset by a million revenue decline in germany 
our business in france experienced a significant shift into systems integration work  while revenue growth in the united kingdom was driven by our continued expansion in that region 
revenue for germany declined as a result of decreasing utilization caused by continued deterioration of market conditions in germany which  consequently  led us to lower billable headcount 
asia pacific revenue decreased in fiscal  driven primarily by decreasing demand for services in japan and china and the planned elimination of subcontractor usage in the region  which more than offset the improved billing rates achieved across the region in fiscal due to significantly lower revenue write offs during the year 
limited opportunities in japan and china led to significant staff reductions and lower utilization rates in those countries 
latin america revenue increased in fiscal  primarily as a function of the weakening of the us dollar against local currencies in latin america particularly the brazilian real 
the combined impact of these foreign currency fluctuations and modest revenue growth in brazil offset significant declines in revenue in all other countries in which we operate in the region 
corporate other our corporate other segment does not contribute significantly to our revenue 
gross profit 
during fiscal  our revenue increased million and total costs of service increased million when compared to fiscal  resulting in a decrease in gross profit of million  or 
gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal the change in gross profit for fiscal compared to fiscal resulted primarily from the following professional compensation expense increased as a percentage of revenue to for fiscal  compared to for fiscal we experienced a net increase in professional compensation expense of million  or  to  million for fiscal from  million for fiscal the increase in professional compensation expense was primarily the result of hiring additional billable employees in response to overall market demand for our services 
additionally  million of this amount was related to the vesting of retention rsus

net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal was million  resulting primarily from net proceeds on the issuance of subordinated debentures with an aggregate principal amount of million  which was offset by the repayments of our existing debt

in addition  issuances of common stock from our espp generated million and million in cash during fiscal years and  respectively 
because we are not current in our sec filings  we are unable to issue freely tradable shares of our common stock 
consequently  we were unable to make any public offerings of our common stock in and have not issued shares under the ltip or espp since early these sources of financing will remain unavailable to us until we are again current in our sec filings 
if we are unable to become current in our sec filings by april   we may also experience increased withdrawals by our employees of their accumulated contributions to our espp 
for more information  see item a  risk factors 
additional cash flow information fiscal during fiscal  we have obtained significantly less cash than expected from our operating activities  primarily due to approximately million in operating losses accrued on the ht contract in fiscal  which resulted in significant cash outflows in fiscal to support the professional services and related expenses required for the completion of the ht system implementation 
other significant uses of cash in operating activities during fiscal include the following approximately million in settlement payments made in various matters related to peregine systems  inc approximately million in retention bonuses to certain of our key employees  approximately million made to our employees as part of the be an owner program  and approximately million of rental payments related to previous lease restructuring efforts 
due to the continued material weaknesses in our internal controls  we continue to devote substantial additional internal and external resources  and experience higher than expected fees for audit services  in connection with completing our consolidated financial statements and the restatement of our consolidated financial statements for prior years 
we believe our costs for through december  related to these efforts will be approximately million 
upon an event of default under the credit facility  the lenders are permitted to require us to post cash collateral in an amount equal to of the principal amount of our letters of credits outstanding 
as of september   under the credit facility we had no outstanding borrowings  an aggregate of approximately million of letters of credit outstanding and borrowing availability of approximately million 
we are also required  in the course of business  particularly with certain of our public services clients  largely in the state and local markets  to obtain surety bonds  letters of credit or bank guarantees for client engagements 
at september   we had million in outstanding surety bonds and million in letters of credit extended to secure certain of these bonds 
the issuers of our outstanding surety bonds may  at any time  require that we post collateral cash or letters of credit to fully secure these obligations 
outlook 
we currently expect that our operations will continue to use  rather than provide a source of  cash through the first quarter of fiscal based on current internal estimates  we nonetheless believe that our cash balances  together with cash generated from operations and available borrowings under our credit facility  will be sufficient to provide adequate funds for our anticipated internal growth and operating needs  including capital expenditures and to meet the cash requirements of our contractual obligations through our management is currently engaged in a number of activities  intended to further improve our cash balances and their accessibility  if current internal estimates for cash uses for fiscal prove incorrect 
these activities include increased focus on reducing our dsos  review and reconsideration of proposed capital expenditure budgets  reviewing our offshore capabilities and operations to increase efficiency and to reduce redundancies in our workforce  and extensive reviews of our borrowing base calculations to ascertain whether we are receiving maximum credit for all available receivables 
furthermore  in fiscal we expect the significant investments we have made  or will make  in fiscal years and with respect to our financial reporting and processes to begin to significantly reduce the cash required to operate our financial reporting and processes 
if our operating performance is materially and adversely effected  the company may be required to post cash collateral to support obligations under its credit facility  as well as its surety bonds  and the company may be unable to obtain new surety bonds  letters of credit or bank guarantees in support of client engagements on acceptable terms  if at all 
we cannot predict whether unexpected events or changes in our business will increase demands for cash collateral to levels that we will be unable to maintain 
if we are unable to maintain the requisite cash collateral levels  or obtain new surety bonds  letters of credit or bank guarantees  our ability to operate and maintain our business could be materially and adversely affected 
after consultation with a number of our external financial advisors and various credit sources  we continue to believe that our available receivables and expected earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortization are sufficient to support additional levels of senior secured lending and that  notwithstanding our not being current in our sec filings  the private equity and debt placement markets remain accessible to us 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to issue equity or debt with acceptable terms 
based on the foregoing and our current state of knowledge of the outlook for our business  we currently believe that cash provided from operations  existing cash balances and available borrowings under our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs through the end of fiscal we also believe that we will continue to have sufficient access to the capital markets to make up any deficiencies if cash provided from operations and existing cash balances are insufficient during this period of time 
however  actual results may differ from current expectations for many reasons  including losses of business that could result from our continuing failure to timely file periodic reports with the sec  possible delisting from the nyse  further downgrades of our credit ratings or unexpected demands on our current cash resources eg  to settle lawsuits 
for additional information regarding various risk factors that could affect our outlook  see item a  risk factors 
if cash provided from operations is insufficient and or our ability to access the capital markets impeded  our business  operations  results and cash flow could be materially and adversely affected

moreover  as a result of the agreement reached in connection with the series b debenture suit  as described above under item legal proceedings sec reporting matters  we entered into the first supplemental indenture pursuant to which i the interest rate payable on the series a debentures increased from per annum to per annum inclusive of any liquidated damages that may be payable due to the failure to file a registration statement for the series a debentures until december   and ii the interest rate payable on the series b debentures increased from per annum to per annum inclusive of any liquidated damages that may be payable due to the failure to file a registration statement for the series b debentures until december  the increased interest rates apply to all series a debentures and series b debentures outstanding 
debt ratings on october   moody s downgraded our corporate family rating to b from b and the ratings for two of our subordinated convertible bonds series to b from b  and placed our ratings on review for further downgrade 
separately  on april   standard poor s ratings services downgraded our senior unsecured rating to b from bb with negative implications 
these downgrades by moody s and standard poor s followed downgrades by each of the rating agencies on december  and march and  actions by the rating agencies may affect our ability to obtain financing or the terms on which such financing may be obtained 
if the rating agencies provide a lower rating for our debt  this may increase the interest rate we must pay if we issue new debt and it may even make it prohibitively expensive for us to issue new debt 
our inability to obtain additional financing  or to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us  could hinder our ability to fund general corporate requirements  limit our ability to compete for new business  and increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions 
credit facility our credit facility provides for up to million in revolving credit and advances  all of which can be available for issuance of letters of credit  and includes up to million in a swingline subfacility 
advances under the revolving credit line are limited by the available borrowing base  which is based upon a percentage of eligible accounts receivable 
as of december   we did not have availability under the borrowing base 
as of september   we had approximately million available under the borrowing base 
we may not have access to the entire million because  among other things i certain accounts receivable for government contracts cannot be included in the calculation of borrowing base without obtaining certain consents this restriction was removed by amendment on march   and ii delays in our ability to provide month end account receivables reports negatively impact our ability to include such account receivables as part of the borrowing base  which determines the amount we may borrow under the credit facility 
borrowings available under the credit facility are used for general corporate purposes 
interest on loans other than swingline loans under the credit facility are calculated  at our option  at a rate equal to libor  or  for dollar denominated loans  at a rate equal to the higher of the bank s corporate base rate or the federal funds rate plus basis points base rate loans 
no matter which rate we choose  an applicable margin is added that varies depending upon availability under the revolver 
interest on swingline loans under the credit facility are calculated at a rate equal to the higher of the bank s corporate base rate or the federal funds rate plus basis points plus the applicable margin for base rate loans 
a facility fee on the unused portion of the commitments of the lenders under the credit facility is due at a rate of per annum 
the credit facility matures on july   unless on or before december   our april senior debentures have not been i fully converted into shares of our common stock or ii refinanced or replaced with securities that do not require us to make any principal payments including  without limitation  by way of a put option on or prior to july   in which case the credit facility matures on december  the credit facility contains affirmative  financial and negative covenants 
the financial covenants include i a minimum us cash collections covenant and ii a maximum trailing twelve month capital expenditures covenant  and iii if we do not maintain a certain amount of minimum borrowing availability  a quarterly increasing minimum trailing twelve month ebitda covenant and a decreasing maximum leverage ratio 
the affirmative covenants include i becoming current in our sec filings according to the following schedule this annual report on form k by november   the forms q for the quarters ended march  june  and september  by the earlier of two months after the date we file this annual report on form k and january   the forms q for the quarters ended march and june  by february   the form q for the quarter ended september  to march   and ii we must have repatriated at least million of cash from foreign subsidiaries in december  we repatriated million of cash from our foreign subsidiaries  and iii we must provide weekly reports with respect to our cash position until we become current in our sec filings and have satisfactory collateral systems  as defined by our lender ie  internal controls and accounting systems with respect to accounts receivable  cash and accounts payable  at which time we must provide monthly reports 
we must also provide monthly reports with respect to our utilization and bookings data through november  including divisional profit and loss statements and operating data for the months of april through november the negative covenants restrict certain of our corporate activities  including  among other things  our ability to make acquisitions or investments  make capital expenditures  repay other indebtedness  merge or consolidate with other entities  dispose of assets  incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends  create liens  make investments including limitations on loans to our foreign subsidiaries settle litigation and engage in certain transactions with affiliates 
the events of default include  among others  defaults based on certain bankruptcy and insolvency events  nonpayment  cross defaults to other debt  payments in respect of judgments against us in excess of million  breach of specified covenants  change of control  termination of trading of our stock  material inaccuracy of representations and warranties  failure to timely deliver audited financial statements  inaccuracy of the borrowing base  the prohibition on restraint on our or any loan party from conducting its business in any manner that has or could reasonably be expected to result in a material adverse effect because of any ruling  decision or order of a court or governmental authority  and indictment  conviction or the commencement of criminal proceedings of or against us or any subsidiary pursuant to which a either damages or penalties could be in excess of million or b such indictment could reasonably be expected to result in a material adverse effect 
we have entered into five amendments to the credit facility 
among other things  these amendments revised certain covenants contained in the credit facility  including the extensions of the filing deadlines for our and periodic reports and an increase in the amounts of civil litigation payments that we are permitted to pay and in the aggregate amount of investments and indebtedness that we are permitted to make and incur with respect to our foreign subsidiaries 
as mentioned above  the credit facility includes a quarterly increasing minimum trailing twelve month ebitda covenant and a decreasing maximum leverage ratio covenant 
these financial covenants are not tested for a quarterly test period if we maintain a minimum level of borrowing availability  which level is based on the amount of the borrowing base a minimum of million based on the september  borrowing base 
as of september   these ratios were not tested because we had approximately million of borrowing availability 
we intend to maintain our minimum borrowing availability in sufficient amounts so as not to trigger the minimum ebitda and maximum leverage ratio covenants  and  we are permitted to post cash collateral  which amount will count toward the borrowing availability  so that these covenants are not tested 
if we do not maintain the required minimum borrowing availability and we are unable to post sufficient cash collateral to rectify the borrowing availability shortfall and these financial covenants are tested  we would likely not be in compliance with these covenants  resulting in a default under the credit facility 
in december  the credit facility was amended to require us to cash collateralize of our borrowings  including any outstanding letters of credit and any accrued and unpaid interest and fees thereon  however  in march  the requirement to deposit and maintain cash collateral terminated as part of an amendment to credit facility  and all of the cash collateral associated with the credit facility approximately million was released to us 
however  upon an event of default under the credit facility  the lenders are still permitted to require us to post cash collateral in an amount equal to of the principal amount of our letters of credits outstanding 
our obligations under the credit facility are secured by liens and security interests in substantially all of our present and future tangible and intangible assets and those of certain of our domestic subsidiaries  as guarantors of such obligations including of the stock of our foreign subsidiaries  subject to certain exceptions 
in addition  in connection with the series b debenture lawsuit described under item  legal proceedings sec reporting matters  the lenders of the credit facility granted us waivers for any default under the credit facility resulting from the series b debenture lawsuit and the defaults alleged therein  and also consented to our payment of consent fees to the holders of each series of our debentures as well as increases in the interest rates payable on all of our debentures 
discontinued credit facilities at december   we had borrowings outstanding of million principally related to credit facilities in place at our japanese subsidiary 
these lines of credit did not contain financial covenants  were not guaranteed by us  and were scheduled to mature on august   but were extended to  and paid in full on  december  on december   we entered into a million interim senior secured credit agreement the interim credit facility  which provided for up to million in revolving credit  all of which was to be available for issuances of letters of credit  and included up to million in a swingline subfacility 
borrowings available under the interim credit facility were intended for working capital  capital expenditures and general corporate purposes 
the interim credit facility was scheduled to mature on may  however  the interim credit facility was terminated by us on april   after we notified the lenders that we would be unable to deliver our audited financial statements on or before april   as was required 
we replaced the interim credit facility with the credit facility described above 
immediately prior to termination of the interim credit facility  there were no outstanding loans under it  however  there were outstanding letters of credit of approximately million  which were issued primarily to meet our obligations to collateralize certain surety bonds issued to support client engagements  mainly in our state and local government business 
the million in letters of credit remained outstanding after the termination of the interim credit facility 
in order to support the letters of credit that remained outstanding  we provided the lenders of the interim credit facility with the following collateral i million of cash which was sourced from cash on hand  and ii a security interest in our domestic accounts receivable 
upon our entering into the credit facility  the lenders under the interim credit facility i released all but million of the cash collateral which million  net of expenses  was returned to us on april   ii released their security interest in the domestic accounts receivable  and iii received an million letter of credit issued by the lenders under the credit facility 
guarantees and indemnification obligations in the normal course of business  we have indemnified third parties and have commitments and guarantees under which we may be required to make payments in certain circumstances 
these indemnities  commitments and guarantees include indemnities of kpmg llp with respect to the consulting business that was transferred to us in january  indemnities to third parties in connection with surety bonds  indemnities to various lessors in connection with facility leases  indemnities to customers related to intellectual property and performance of services subcontracted to other providers  and indemnities to directors and officers under the organizational documents and agreements with them 
the duration of these indemnities  commitments and guarantees varies  and in certain cases  is indefinite 
certain of these indemnities  commitments and guarantees do not provide for any limitation of the maximum potential future payments we could be obligated to make 
we estimate that the fair value of these agreements was minimal 
accordingly  no liabilities have been recorded for these agreements as of december  information regarding the amounts of our outstanding surety and surety related bonds and letters of credit can be found above 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires that management make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
management s estimates  assumptions and judgments are derived and continually evaluated based on available information  historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process  actual results could differ from those estimates 
the areas that we believe are our most critical accounting policies include basis of presentation and consolidation  revenue recognition  valuation of accounts receivable  valuation of goodwill  accounting for income taxes  valuation of long lived assets  accounting for leases  restructuring charges  legal contingencies  retirement benefits  accounting for stock options  accounting for intercompany loans  and accounting for employee global mobility and tax equalization 
a critical accounting policy is one that involves making difficult  subjective or complex accounting estimates that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate  and different estimates that we could have used  or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur  may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
basis of presentation and consolidation the consolidated financial statements reflect the operations of our company and all of our majority owned subsidiaries 
upon consolidation  all significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated 
prior to  certain of our consolidated foreign subsidiaries within the emea  asia pacific and latin america regions reported their results on a one month lag 
during  the one month lag for certain of these subsidiaries within the emea and asia pacific regions was eliminated see note  summary of significant accounting principles  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
as of december   certain of our consolidated foreign subsidiaries within our emea region continue to report their results of operations on a one month lag 
starting on july   we changed our fiscal year from a twelve month period ending june to a twelve month period ending december revenue recognition we earn revenue from three primary sources technology integration services where we design  build and implement new or enhanced system applications and related processes  services to provide general business consulting  such as system selection or assessment  feasibility studies  business valuations and corporate strategy services and managed services in which we manage  staff  maintain  host or otherwise run solutions and systems provided to our customers 
contracts for these services have different terms based on the scope  deliverables and complexity of the engagement  which require us to make judgments and estimates in recognizing revenue 
fees for these contracts may be in the form of time and materials  cost plus or fixed price 
technology integration services represent a significant portion of our business and are generally accounted for under the percentage of completion method in accordance with the statement of position sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts sop 
under the percentage of completion method  management estimates the percentage of completion based upon costs to the client incurred as a percentage of the total estimated costs to the client 
when total cost estimates exceed revenue  we accrue for the estimated losses immediately 
the use of the percentage of completion method requires significant judgment relative to estimating total contract revenue and costs  including assumptions relative to the length of time to complete the project  the nature and complexity of the work to be performed  and anticipated changes in estimated salaries and other costs 
incentives and award payments are included in estimated revenue using the percentage of completion method when the realization of such amounts is deemed probable upon achievement of certain defined goals 
estimates of total contract revenue and costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract and are subject to revision as the contract progresses 
when revisions in estimated contract revenue and costs are determined  such adjustments are recorded in the period in which they are first identified 
revenue for general business consulting services is recognized as work is performed and amounts are earned in accordance with the staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab no 
 revenue recognition sab 
we consider amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained  services are delivered  fees are fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
for contracts with fees based on time and materials or cost plus  we recognize revenue over the period of performance 
depending on the specific contractual provisions and nature of the deliverable  revenue may be recognized on a proportional performance model based on level of effort  as milestones are achieved or when final deliverables have been provided 
for our managed service arrangements  we typically implement or build system applications for customers that we then manage or run for periods that may span several years 
such arrangements include the delivery of a combination of one or more of our service offerings and are governed by the emerging issues task force eitf issue  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
in managed service arrangements in which the system application implementation or build has standalone value to the customer  and we have evidence of fair value for the managed or run services  we bifurcate the total arrangement into two units of accounting i the system application implementation or build  which is recognized as technology integration services using the percentage of completion method under sop  and ii the managed or run services that are recognized under sab ratably over the estimated life of the customer relationship 
in instances where we are unable to bifurcate a managed service arrangement into separate units of accounting  the total contract is recognized as one unit of accounting under sab in such instances  total fees and costs related to the system application implementation or build are deferred and recognized together with managed or run services upon completion of the software application implementation or build ratably over the estimated life of the customer relationship 
certain managed service arrangements may also include transaction based services in addition to the system application implementation or build and managed services 
fees from transaction based services are recognized as earned if we have evidence of fair value for such transactions  otherwise  transaction fees are spread ratably over the remaining life of the customer relationship period as received 
the determination of fair value requires us to use significant judgment 
we determine the fair value of service revenue based upon our recent pricing for those services when sold separately and or prevailing market rates for similar services 
revenue includes reimbursements of travel and out of pocket expenses with equivalent amounts of expense recorded in other costs of service revenue 
in addition  we generally enter into relationships with subcontractors where we maintain a principal relationship with the customer 
in such instances  subcontractor costs are included in revenue with offsetting expenses recorded in other direct contract expenses 
unbilled revenue consists of recognized recoverable costs and accrued profits on contracts for which billings had not been presented to clients as of the balance sheet date 
management anticipates that the collection of these amounts will occur within one year of the balance sheet date 
billings in excess of revenue recognized for which payments have been received are recorded as deferred revenue until the applicable revenue recognition criteria have been met 
valuation of accounts receivable we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
assessing the collectibility of customer receivables requires management judgment 
we determine our allowance for doubtful accounts by specifically analyzing individual accounts receivable  historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic and accounts receivable aging trends  and changes in our customer payment terms 
our valuation reserves are periodically re evaluated and adjusted as more information about the ultimate collectibility of accounts receivable becomes available 
valuation of goodwill goodwill is the amount by which the cost of acquired net assets in a business acquisition exceeded the fair value of net identifiable assets on the date of purchase 
following the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  we no longer amortize goodwill and certain intangible assets  but instead assess the impairment of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets on at least an annual basis on april and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment review of the carrying amount of goodwill is conducted if events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historically or projected future operating results  identification of other impaired assets within a reporting unit  the disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit  significant adverse changes in business climate or regulations  significant changes in senior management  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  a significant decline in our credit rating  or a reduction of our market capitalization relative to net book value 
determining whether a triggering event has occurred includes significant judgment from management 
the goodwill impairment test prescribed by sfas requires us to identify reporting units and to determine estimates of the fair value of our reporting units as of the date we test for impairment 
as of december   our reporting units consisted of our three north america industry groups and our three international regions 
to conduct a goodwill impairment test  the fair value of the reporting unit is compared with its carrying value 
if the reporting unit s carrying value exceeds its fair value  we record an impairment loss to the extent that the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
the fair value of a reporting unit is the amount for which the unit as a whole could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties 
we estimate the fair values of our reporting units using discounted cash flow valuation models 
those models require estimates of future revenue  profits  capital expenditures and working capital for each unit 
we estimate these amounts by evaluating historical trends  current budgets  operating plans and industry data 
determining the fair value of reporting units and goodwill includes significant judgment by management and different judgments could yield different results 
in april  we determined that a triggering event had occurred  causing us to perform a goodwill impairment test on all reporting units 
the triggering event resulted from our public announcement of likely restatements of prior period financial statements along with significant delays in filing annual results and anticipated delays in filing quarterly results 
we determined this triggering event may have a significant adverse effect on our business climate and regulatory environment 
as required by sfas  we performed step one of the impairment test to identify the potential impairment and determined there was no impairment to any reporting units 
during the fourth quarter of  we determined that a triggering event had occurred  causing us to perform a goodwill impairment test on all of its reporting units 
the triggering event resulted from a combination of various factors  including lower than previously expected results in the fourth quarter of fiscal and the change in management s expectation of future results 
as required by sfas no 
 we performed a two step impairment test to identify the potential impairments and  if necessary  to measure the amount of the impairment 
under step one of the impairment test  we determined there were potential impairments in our commercial services and emea reporting units 
in determining the fair value of our commercial services and emea reporting units  we revised certain assumptions and refined certain valuation techniques relative to each reporting unit  which significantly decreased their fair value as compared to the fair value determined during our most recent goodwill impairment test  which was performed as of april  for the commercial services reporting unit  these revisions included the negative impact on future periods from operating losses associated with the ht contract 
for the emea reporting unit  these revisions included lowering operating margin growth expectations 
in order to quantify the impairment  under step two of the impairment test  we completed a hypothetical purchase price allocation of the fair value determined in step one to all of the respective assets and liabilities of our commercial services and emea reporting units 
as a result  goodwill impairment losses of  and  were recognized in the commercial services and the emea reporting units  respectively  as the carrying amount of each reporting unit was greater than the revised fair value of that reporting unit as determined using the expected present value of future cash flows  and the carrying amount of each reporting unit s goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of that goodwill 
the goodwill impairment loss of  for the commercial services reporting unit represented a full impairment of the remaining goodwill in that reporting unit 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we determined that a triggering event had occurred  causing us to perform a goodwill impairment test for all reporting units 
the triggering event resulted from downgrades in our credit rating in december  significant changes in senior management and underperforming foreign legal entities 
as required by sfas  we performed a two step impairment test to identify the impairment and  measure the amount of the impairment 
under step one of the impairment test  we determined there was a potential impairment in our emea reporting unit 
in determining the fair value of our emea reporting unit at december   we revised certain assumptions relative to emea  which significantly decreased the fair value of this reporting unit relative to the fair value determined during our annual goodwill impairment test  which was of april  these revisions included lowering our emea segment revenue growth expectations  increasing selling  general and administrative cost projections and factoring in a less than anticipated decrease in compensation expense 
these changes reflected lower than expected results for the year ended december  and management s current expectations of future results 
in order to quantify the impairment  under step two of the impairment test  we completed a hypothetical purchase price allocation of fair value determined in step one to all assets and liabilities of our emea reporting unit 
as a result  a goodwill impairment loss of million was recognized in our emea reporting unit as the carrying amount of the reporting unit was greater than the revised fair value of the reporting unit as determined using the expected present value of future cash flows and the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of that goodwill 
accounting for income taxes provisions for federal  state and foreign income taxes are calculated on reported pre tax earnings based on current tax law and also include  in the current period  the cumulative effect of any changes in tax rates from those used previously in determining deferred tax assets and liabilities 
such provisions differ from the amounts currently receivable or payable because certain items of income and expense are recognized in different time periods for financial reporting purposes than for income tax purposes 
significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and evaluating tax positions 
we establish reserves for income tax when  despite the belief that our tax positions are fully supportable  there remain certain positions that are probable to be challenged and possibly disallowed by various authorities 
the consolidated tax provision and related accruals include the impact of such reasonably estimable losses and related interest as deemed appropriate 
to the extent that the probable tax outcome of these matters changes  such changes in estimate will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determination is made 
the majority of our deferred tax assets at december  consisted of federal  foreign and state net operating loss carryforwards that will expire between and during  the valuation allowance against federal  state  and certain foreign net operating loss and foreign tax credit carryforwards increased million over fiscal  based on projections of future losses 
since our inception  various foreign  state and local authorities have audited us in the area of income taxes 
those audits included examining the timing and amount of deductions  the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions and compliance with foreign  state and local tax laws 
in evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions we accrue charges for exposures related to uncertain tax positions 
during  the internal revenue service commenced a federal income tax examination for the tax years ended june   june   december   december  and december  we are unable to determine the ultimate outcome of these examinations  but we believe that we have established appropriate reserves related to apportionment of income between jurisdictions  the impact of the restatement items and certain filing positions 
we are also under examination from time to time in foreign  state and local jurisdictions 
in  we filed a federal refund claim related to in the amount of million regarding a net operating loss carryback 
we anticipate receiving the federal income tax refund before december  at december   we believe we have appropriately accrued for exposures related to uncertain tax positions 
to the extent we were to prevail in matters for which accruals have been established or be required to pay amounts in excess of reserves  our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted 
during fiscal  fiscal  the six months ended december  and the year ended june   none of the established reserves expired based on the statute of limitations with respect to certain tax examination periods 
in addition  an increase to the reserve for tax exposures of million  million  million and million  respectively  was recorded as an income tax expense for additional exposures  including interest and penalties 
the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions to realize the value of these assets 
if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in these jurisdictions  a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that the value of the deferred tax assets is not realizable 
management evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets and assesses the need for any valuation allowance 
in  we determined that it was more likely than not that a significant amount of our deferred tax assets primarily in the us may not be realized  therefore we recorded a valuation allowance against those deferred assets 
valuation of long lived assets long lived assets primarily include property and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives purchased software  internal capitalized software  and customer lists 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we periodically review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives are no longer appropriate 
each impairment test is based on a comparison of the undiscounted cash flows to the recorded value of the asset 
if an impairment is indicated  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value based on a discounted cash flow analysis 
determining the fair value of long lived assets includes significant judgment by management  and different judgments could yield different results 
accounting for leases we lease all of our office facilities under non cancelable operating leases that expire at various dates through  along with options that permit renewals for additional periods 
rent abatements and escalations are considered in the determination of straight line rent expense for operating leases 
leasehold improvements made at the inception of or during the lease are amortized over the shorter of the asset life or the lease term 
we receive incentives to lease office facilities in certain areas 
these incentives are recorded as a deferred credit and recognized as a reduction to rent expense on a straight line basis over the lease term 
restructuring charges we periodically record restructuring charges resulting from restructuring our operations including consolidation and or relocation of operations  changes in our strategic plan or management responses to increasing costs or declines in demand 
the determination of restructuring charges requires management to utilize significant judgment and estimates related to expenses for employee benefits  such as costs of severance and termination benefits  and costs for future lease commitments on excess facilities  net of estimated future sublease income 
in determining the amount of lease and facilities restructuring charges  we are required to estimate such factors as future vacancy rates  the time required to sublet excess facilities and sublease rates 
these estimates are reviewed and potentially revised on a quarterly basis based on available information and known market conditions 
if our assumptions prove to be inaccurate  we may need to make changes in these estimates that could impact our financial position and results of operations 
legal contingencies we are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings 
we periodically review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss 
we use significant judgment in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  accruals are based only on the best information at that time 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates 
such revisions in the estimates of potential liabilities could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
we expense legal fees as incurred 
retirement benefits our pension plans and postretirement benefit plans are accounted for using actuarial valuations required by sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
the pension plans relate to our plans for employees in germany and switzerland 
accounting for retirement plans requires management to make significant subjective judgments about a number of actuarial assumptions  including discount rates  salary growth  long term return on plan assets  retirement  turnover  health care cost trend rates and mortality rates 
depending on the assumptions and estimates used  the pension and postretirement benefit expense could vary within a range of outcomes and have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 
in addition  the assumptions can materially affect accumulated benefit obligations and future cash funding 
for fiscal  the discount rate to determine the benefit obligation for the pension plans was 
the discount rate reflects the rate at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled 
the rate is based upon comparable high quality corporate bond yields with maturities consistent with expected pension payment periods 
a basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease the pension expense for the plans by approximately million 
a basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase the pension expense for the plans by approximately million 
the expected long term rate of return on assets for the fiscal was 
this rate represents the average of the long term rates of return for the defined benefit plan weighted by the plans assets as of december  to develop this assumption  we considered historical asset returns  the current asset allocation and future expectations of asset returns 
the actual long term rate of return from july  until december  was 
based upon current market conditions  the expected long term rate of return for fiscal will be 
a basis point increase or decrease in the expected long term rate of return on the plans assets would have approximately a million impact on our pension expense 
as of december   the pension plan had an million unrecognized actuarial loss that will be expensed over the average future working lifetime of active participants 
we also offer a postretirement medical plan to the majority of our full time us employees and managing directors who meet specific eligibility requirements 
for fiscal  the discount rate to determine the benefit obligation was 
the discount rate reflects the rate at which the benefits could be effectively settled 
the rate is based upon comparable high quality corporate bond yields with maturities consistent with expected retiree medical payment periods 
a basis point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have approximately a million impact on the retiree medical expense for the plan 
as of december   the pension plan had million in unrecognized actuarial losses that will be expensed over the average future working lifetime of active participants 
accounting for stock based compensation we have various stock based compensation plans under which we have granted stock options  restricted stock awards and rsus to certain officers  employees and non employee directors 
we granted both service based and performance based rsus and stock options during fiscal for the service based rsus  the fair value is fixed on the date of grant based on the number of rsus or stock options issued and the fair value of the company s stock on the date of grant 
for the performance based rsus and stock options  the fair value is estimated on the date the performance conditions are established based on the fair value of the company s stock and the company s estimate of the number of rsus or stock options that will ultimately be issued 
each quarter  we re measure the fair value of the unvested performance based rsus or stock options based on stock price fluctuations  and compare the actual performance results with the performance conditions 
the determination of successful compliance with the performance conditions requires significant judgment by management  as differing outcomes may have a significant impact on current and future stock compensation expense 
we recognize stock option costs pursuant to accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb and have elected to disclose the impact of expensing stock options pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which replaces sfas and supersedes apb sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values 
the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
beginning in the first quarter of fiscal  we will adopt the provisions of sfas r under the modified prospective transition method using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option pricing model requires us to apply highly subjective assumptions  including expected stock price volatility  expected life of the option and the risk free interest rate 
a change in one or more of the assumptions used in the black scholes option pricing model may result in a material change to the estimated fair value of the stock based compensation 
accounting for intercompany loans intercompany loans are classified between long and short term based on management s intent regarding repayment 
translation gains and losses on short term debt are recorded in other income expense  net  in our consolidated financial statements and similar gains and losses on long term debt are recorded as other comprehensive income in our consolidated statements of changes in stockholders equity deficit 
accordingly  changes in management s intent relative to the expected repayment of these intercompany loans will change the amount of translation gains and losses included in our consolidated financial statements 
accounting for employee global mobility and tax equalization we have a tax equalization policy designed to ensure that our employees on domestic long term and foreign assignments will be subject to the same level of personal tax regardless of the tax jurisdiction in which the employee works

recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas r  which replaces sfas and supersedes apb sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values beginning with the first reporting period following the fiscal year that begins on or after june  the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
we are required to adopt sfas r in the first quarter of fiscal  beginning january  under sfas r  we must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at date of adoption 
the transition methods include modified prospective and modified retroactive adoption options 
under the modified retroactive option  prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented 
the modified prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas r  while the modified retroactive method would record compensation expense for all unvested stock options and restricted stock beginning with the first period restated 
in march  sab no 
 share based payment sab was issued regarding the sec s interpretation of sfas r and the valuation of share based payments for public companies 
we currently utilize the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value for the above pro forma calculations and will continue using the same methodology in the foreseeable future 
we will use the modified prospective method for adoption of sfas r  and expect that the incremental compensation cost to be recognized as a result of the adoption of sfas r and sab for fiscal will range from million to million 
in march  the fasb issued interpretation fin no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations fin 
this is an interpretation of sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas  which applies to all entities and addresses the legal obligations with the retirement of tangible long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development or normal operation of a long lived asset 
sfas requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
fin further clarifies what the term conditional asset retirement obligation means with respect to recording the asset retirement obligation discussed in sfas the provisions of fin are effective no later than december  the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements  and changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
sfas requires restatement of prior period financial statements  unless impracticable  for changes in accounting principle 
the retroactive application of a change in accounting principle should be limited to the direct effect of the change 
changes in depreciation  amortization or depletion methods should be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate 
corrections of accounting errors will be accounted for under the guidance contained in apb the effective date of this new pronouncement is for fiscal years beginning after december  and prospective application is required 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

in september  the sec staff issued sab no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab was issued in order to eliminate the diversity of practice surrounding how public companies quantify financial statement misstatements 
sab requires registrants to quantify the impact of correcting all misstatements using both the rollover method  which focuses primarily on the impact of a misstatement on the income statement and is the method we currently use  and the iron curtain method  which focuses primarily on the effect of correcting the period end balance sheet 
the use of both of these methods is referred to as the dual approach and should be combined with the evaluation of qualitative elements surrounding the errors in accordance with sab no 
 materiality sab 
we do not expect the adoption of sab to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a number of market risks in the ordinary course of business 
these risks  which include interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange risk  arise in the normal course of business rather than from trading activities 
interest rate risk our exposure to potential losses due to changes in interest rates relates primarily to our variable rate japanese yen denominated debt 
as a result  we have relatively minimal exposure to changes in interest rates related to our long term debt obligations 
the fair value of our debt obligations may increase or decrease for various reasons  including fluctuations in the market price of our common stock  fluctuations in market interest rates and fluctuations in general economic conditions 
the table below presents principal cash flows net of discounts and related weighted average interest rates by scheduled maturity dates for our debt obligations as of december  expected maturity date year ended december  in thousands us dollars  except interest rates thereafter total fair value japanese yen functional currency third party japanese yen denominated debt variable rate average interest rate euro functional currency germany average fixed interest rate us dollar functional currency series a convertible subordinated debentures average fixed interest rate us dollar functional currency series b convertible subordinated debentures average fixed interest rate us dollar functional currency series c convertible subordinated debentures average fixed interest rate us dollar functional currency convertible senior subordinated debentures average fixed interest rate us dollar functional currency average fixed interest rate due to our continuing inability to become current in our sec reporting requirements  we remain unable to file and declare effective a registration statement with the sec to register for resale any of debentures and the underlying common stock 
accordingly  prior to november  as liquidated damages for the impact of our inability to file and declare effective such a registration statement  the applicable interest rate on each series of subordinated debentures increased by beginning on march  and by an additional beginning on june  the interest rate on each series of the senior debentures increased by as of january  these changes combined to increase the interest rate on the series a debentures and the series b debentures to and  respectively  and on the april senior debentures and the july senior debentures to and  respectively 
these increased interest rates on the senior debentures will continue to be the applicable rates until we are able to have these registration statements declared effective 
moreover  as a result of the agreement reached in connection with the series b debenture suit on november   as described above under item legal proceedings sec reporting matters  we entered into the first supplemental indenture pursuant to which i the interest rate payable on the series a debentures increased from per annum to per annum inclusive of any liquidated damages that may be payable due to any continuing failure to file a registration statement for the series a debentures until december   and ii the interest rate payable on the series b debentures increased from per annum to per annum inclusive of any liquidated damages that may be payable due to any continuing failure to file a registration statement for the series b debentures until december  for additional information refer to note  summary of significant accounting policies  and note  notes payable  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
foreign currency exchange risk we operate internationally and are exposed to potentially adverse movements in foreign currency rate changes 
any foreign currency transaction  defined as a transaction denominated in a currency other than the us dollar  will be reported in us dollars at the applicable exchange rate 
assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and income and expense items are translated at average rates for the period 
during fiscal  we used foreign currency forward contracts to offset currency related changes in certain of our foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities 
all purchased foreign exchange contracts were offset by sold foreign exchange contracts and all foreign exchange contracts were settled by june we have significant foreign exchange exposures related primarily to short term intercompany loans denominated in non us dollars to certain of our foreign subsidiaries  which we historically have not hedged 
the potential gain or loss in the fair value of these intercompany loans that would result from a hypothetical change of in exchange rates would be approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively
