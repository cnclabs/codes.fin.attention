we have designed our software for use by organizations of all sizes to manage the efficiency and ensure the reliability and availability of complex and distributed it environments 
we believe that the comprehensive functionality of our products  combined with their ease of installation and use  allows an organization to lower its total cost of it ownership 
our products are used by businesses in a wide variety of industries and computing environments 
we were incorporated in utah in august and reincorporated in delaware in february 
table of contents history and background we began operations in as the software division of keylabs  a privately held independent software quality and e commerce testing company

sources of revenue we derive the large majority of our revenue from sales of software licenses 
we sell our products through online sales and our direct sales force  as well as through indirect channels  such as distributors  value added resellers  or vars  oems  and systems integrators 
we also derive revenue from sales of annual upgrade protection aup  technical support arrangements  consulting and training services 
generally  we include the first year of aup with the initial license of our products 
after the initial aup term  the customer can renew aup on an annual basis 
the majority of our revenue has been generated in the united states 
revenue from customers outside of the united states accounted for of our total revenue in  of our total revenue in  and of our total revenue in as of december   we had sales people located internationally in canada  latin america  europe  africa  the middle east  australia and asia 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position  or sop  as modified by sop sop  as modified  which generally requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements such as software products  aup  technical support  installation and training to be allocated to each element based on the relative fair values of the elements 
the fair value of an element must be based on vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe 
we establish vsoe based on the price charged when the same element is sold separately 
if vsoe of all undelivered elements exists but vsoe does not exist for one or more delivered elements  then revenue is recognized using the residual method 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the license fee is recognized as revenue 
license revenue we license our it lifecycle management products primarily under perpetual licenses 
we recognize revenue from licensing of software products to an end user when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and the software product has been delivered to the customer  provided there are no uncertainties surrounding product acceptance  fees are fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
for licenses where vsoe for aup and any other undelivered elements exists  license revenue is recognized upon 
table of contents delivery using the residual method 
for licensing of our software to oems  revenue is not recognized until the licenses are sold by the oem to an end user customer 
for licensing of our software through other indirect sales channels  revenue is recognized when the licenses are sold by the reseller  var or distributor to an end user customer 
we consider all arrangements with payment terms longer than our normal business practice  which do not extend beyond months  not to be fixed or determinable and revenue is recognized when the fee becomes due 
if collectibility is not considered probable for reasons other than extended payment terms  revenue is recognized when the fee is collected 
service arrangements are evaluated to determine whether the services are essential to the functionality of the software 
generally  services are not considered essential to the functionality of our software 
revenue is recognized using contract accounting for arrangements involving significant customization or modification of the software or where services are considered essential to the functionality of the software 
revenue from these software arrangements is recognized using the percentage of completion method with progress to complete measured using labor cost inputs 
as of december   we had million of deferred revenue 
services revenue we derive services revenue primarily from aup  technical support arrangements  consulting  training  and user training conferences 
aup and technical support revenue is recognized using the straight line method over the period that the aup or support is provided 
revenue from training arrangements or seminars and from consulting services is recognized as the services are performed or seminars are held 
critical accounting policies the policies discussed below are considered by us to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements 
the application of these policies places significant demands on the judgment of our management and  when reporting financial results  causes us to rely on estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we describe specific risks related to these critical accounting policies below 
a summary of significant accounting policies can be found in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
regarding all of these policies  we caution that future results rarely develop exactly as forecast  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
our critical accounting policies include the following revenue recognition  allowances for doubtful accounts receivable and product returns  impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles  long lived assets  and valuation allowances against deferred income tax assets 
as described above  we recognize revenue in accordance with sop  as amended 
revenue recognition in accordance with sop can be complex due to the nature and variability of our sales transactions 
to continue recognizing software license revenue in the period in which we obtain persuasive evidence of an arrangement and deliver the software  we must have vsoe for each undelivered element 
if we do not continue to maintain vsoe for undelivered elements  we would be required to defer recognizing the software license revenue until the other elements are delivered  which could have a significant negative impact on our revenue 
additionally  the assessment that services are not essential to the functionality of the software may change depending on our mix between services and software products of  and types of services in  future arrangements 
further implementation guidelines relating to sop and related modifications as well as new pronouncements may result in unanticipated changes in our revenue recognition practices and such changes could significantly affect our future revenues and results of operations 
we offer credit terms on the sale of our products to a significant majority of our customers and require no collateral from these customers 
we generally also provide a day return right 
we periodically perform credit evaluations of certain customers financial condition and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable based upon our historical collection experience and expected collectibility of all 
table of contents accounts receivable 
we also maintain an allowance for estimated returns based on our historical experience 
revenue generated from operations in geographical locations where we do not yet have sufficient historical return experience is not recognized until the return right lapses 
our actual bad debts and returns may differ from our estimates and the difference could be significant 
in connection with the assets acquired from computing edge  tekworks  previo  wise solutions  fslogic  bridgewater  tonic  pedestal  and the carbon copy technology  we recorded million of intangible assets consisting of intellectual property  customer relationships  core technology  trademark and trade name  non compete agreements  and in process research and development 
in process research and development is written off immediately to the statement of operations 
we also recorded million of goodwill for the wise solutions and pedestal acquisitions 
trademark and trade name associated with the wise solutions acquisition and goodwill have indefinite lives 
we evaluate goodwill and other indefinite lived assets for impairment  using a fair value based analysis  at least annually 
the remainder of the identifiable intangible assets is amortized over the estimated useful lives ranging from months to years 
we evaluate our identifiable intangible assets  property and equipment and other long lived assets for impairment and assess their recoverability when changes in circumstances lead us to believe that any of our long lived assets may be impaired 
we assess recoverability by comparing the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset to the asset s carrying amount 
if an impairment is indicated  the write down is measured as the difference between the carrying amount and the estimated fair value 
we performed an impairment test as of december   and determined that no intangible assets were impaired 
we provided a valuation allowance on our us net deferred tax assets as of december  the valuation allowance was recorded due to the uncertainties regarding our future operating profitability  our limited operating history  and the high volatility of the industry in which we operate 
as of december   we have overcome some of these uncertainties and earned sufficient operating income to utilize a portion of our deferred tax assets and released a portion of this valuation allowance 
the benefit associated with the release of the valuation allowance attributable to stock option tax deductions was recorded as an increase to additional paid in capital  with the residual balance recorded as a decrease to the current year tax provision on the statement of operations through the effective rate 
we continue to maintain a valuation allowance of approximately million against certain net operating losses provided in certain acquisitions and foreign jurisdictions because it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets may not be realized 
we continue to have a significant number of outstanding stock options that are expected to result in a significant reduction of future taxable income when the employees exercise such options 
predictability of limited operating results we have incurred significant costs to develop our technology and products  to recruit and train personnel for our engineering  sales  marketing  professional services  and administration departments  and to build and promote our brand 
as a result  in certain periods of our existence  we have incurred significant losses 
during  we eliminated the accumulated deficit of million that existed as of december  and have retained earnings of million as of december  our quarterly revenue and operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
limited operating history makes the prediction of future operating results difficult 
we believe that period to period comparisons of operating results should not be relied upon to predict future performance 
our prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties encountered by companies at an early stage of development  particularly companies in rapidly evolving markets 
we are subject to the risks of uncertainty of market acceptance and demand for our products and services  competition from larger  more established companies  short product life cycles  our ability to develop and bring to market new products on a timely basis  dependence on key employees  the ability to attract and retain additional qualified personnel  the ability to obtain adequate financing to support growth  and such other risks described under the caption factors that may affect future results of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and elsewhere in this annual 
table of contents report on form k 
in addition  we have been dependent on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our revenue 
we may not be successful in addressing these risks and difficulties

r  share based payments 
sfas no 
r is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb among other items  sfas r eliminates the use of apb and the intrinsic value method of accounting  and requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments  based on the grant date fair value of those awards  in the financial statements 
the effective date of sfas r is the first annual reporting period beginning after june   which is the first quarter of the company s year ending december  the company currently utilizes a standard option pricing model ie  black scholes to measure the fair value of stock options granted to employees for disclosure purposes 
while sfas r permits entities to continue to use such a model  the standard also permits the use of a lattice model

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio and have no foreign exchange contracts 
our financial instruments consist of cash and marketable securities  trade accounts receivable  accounts payable and short and long term obligations 
we consider investments in highly liquid instruments purchased with an original maturity of days or less to be cash equivalents 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our short and long term obligations 
thus  fluctuations in interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value of these securities 
our business is principally transacted in united states dollars 
during the years ended december  and  approximately of the us dollar value of our invoices were denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar 
accordingly  we are subject to exposure from adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
this exposure is primarily related to local currency denominated revenue and operating expenses in australia  france  germany  estonia  japan  mexico  the netherlands  singapore  sweden  and the united kingdom 
we believe that a natural hedge exists in local currencies  as local currency denominated revenue will substantially offset the local currency denominated operating expenses 
we will continue to assess our need to hedge currency exposures on an ongoing basis 
however  as of december   we had no hedging contracts outstanding 
at december   we had million in cash and available for sale securities 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material impact on our results of operations  or the fair market value or cash flows of these instruments
