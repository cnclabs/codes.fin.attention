item a 
risk factors 
the company is subject to a number of important risks and uncertainties 
the accompanying risk factors should be read in conjunction with the information included in this annual report on form k 
we have incurred substantial indebtedness 
amounts outstanding under the revolving facility  the term a and term b facilities at december  were   and  respectively 
the ratio of long term debt to total capitalization was at december  this substantial indebtedness represents an element of risk in the event that our operating proceeds are insufficient to meet the principal and interest payments on our indebtedness 
if our cash flow is insufficient to service our debt  the value of our equity could be reduced or eliminated through foreclosure 
restrictions imposed by the terms of our loan agreement may limit our operating and financial flexibility 
all of our assets have been pledged as security for any borrowings under the loan agreement as hereinafter defined 
the loan agreement contains various business and financial covenants including among other things  a debt service ratio  a net worth covenant and a ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth 
our failure to comply with our obligations under the loan agreement may result in an event of default  which  if not cured or waived  may permit acceleration of the indebtedness under the loan agreement 
we most likely would not have sufficient funds available to pay any accelerated indebtedness and cannot be certain that we would even have the ability to refinance accelerated indebtedness on favorable terms should an event of default occur 
changes in interest rates affect the interest rate payable under our loan agreement 
we are exposed to interest rate fluctuations  primarily as a result of its loan agreement with rates which are based on a factor of the prime rate and thus subject to market fluctuations 
we do not currently use derivative instruments to alter the interest rate characteristics of any debt 
general economic conditions and conditions in the retail environment could adversely affect our customers 
our largest customers are in the retail grocery business and we guarantee the sales to the majority of these customers 
accordingly  a slow down in the economy  especially in the retail market could directly affect the company s revenues and profitability 
we are dependent on a few large customers 
during  our two largest customers represented and of its net sales 
we do not have a long term contract with either of these customers and the loss of either customer would have a material adverse affect on the company s business 
reduced spending by customers could significantly impact our operating results  financial condition and cash flows 
while we enjoy very good relationships with our customers  there can be no assurance that our principal customers will continue to purchase products from us at the current levels 
orders from our customers are affected by factors such as new product introductions  product life cycles  inventory levels  manufacturing strategies  contract awards  competitive conditions and general economic conditions 
the reduction  delay or cancellation of orders or a delay in shipment of products to such customers could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and cash flows 
prices of our raw materials regularly fluctuate 
the cost of our raw materials  especially herring  salmon and honey  represents a large portion of the cost to customers of our products 
customers may be unwilling to pay cost increases resulting from increases in raw material prices 
a significant increase in the cost of our products which cannot be passed on to the customers could have an adverse affect on our revenues and profits 
we have numerous competitors with financial and other resources greater than ours 
we encounter competition from a number of competitors in the sale of our products 
many of our competitors have financial  product development and other resources greater than ours 
our inability to compete with our competitors effectively by developing and introducing innovative new products on a timely basis could have an adverse affect on our results of operations 
our business is seasonal in nature 
many of our products are seasonal in nature causing a concentration of annual revenue generation to occur in a relatively short time span 
consequently  a loss of business during the peak business season  for any reason  may result in reduced full year revenues 
we may be unable to execute our acquisition strategy 
our long term strategy includes a focus on acquisitions 
we anticipate that significant future growth  if any  will be the result of the acquisition strategy and the successful integration of the acquired businesses into the existing operations 
currently  we have no agreements or understandings with respect to any acquisitions and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in pursuing other potential acquisitions 
moreover  no assurances can be given that any completed acquisition will be beneficial to us or that the operations of an acquired entity will be successfully integrated into our operations 
in addition  the costs associated with this strategy  means of financing any potential acquisitions  and consummation and integration of any potential acquisitions could significantly impact our financial and operating performance 
we may experience significant volatility in our stock price which may negatively impact our ability to finance future growth 
the trading price of our common stock is subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarter to quarter fluctuations in operating results and other events or factors 
in addition  stock markets have experienced extreme price and trading volume volatility in recent years 
our common stock has historically had relatively small trading volumes 
as a result  small transactions in our common stock can have a disproportionately large impact on the quoted price of the common stock 
we believe that our future growth through either current operations or any future acquisitions may be at least partially financed through the capital markets 
thus  fluctuations in our stock price will have an affect on the financing available 
we are dependent on attracting and retaining key personnel 
the company believes the success of the organization is dependant upon the continued success of attracting and retaining talented personnel 
the terms of our relationships with our suppliers could change 
we do not have long term purchase agreements with any supplier 
our ability to continue to procure key materials at a competitive price is critical to future success 
there can be no assurance that our current suppliers will not consolidate  go out of business  terminate their relationship with us or negatively change the terms upon which they service us 
we purchase herring from one supplier 
other raw materials and co packed products  such as salmon  are purchased from a number of sources  allowing us to negotiate competitive prices 
a consolidation of such suppliers could have an adverse affect on the price of our key materials 
trade accounts receivable potentially subject us to significant concentrations of credit risk 
we primarily provide credit in the normal course of business 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and maintain allowances for potential credit losses  if necessary 
however  actual write offs could exceed those recorded allowances for doubtful accounts 
promotional programs offered to our customers may result in excessive cost 
in accordance with industry practices  inventory is sold to customers often with the right to return or dispose if the merchandise is not resold prior to the expiration of its shelf life 
in order to support our products  various marketing programs are offered to customers  which reimburse them for a portion  or all of their promotional activities related to our products 
we regularly review and revise  when we deem necessary  estimates of costs to us for these marketing and merchandising programs based on estimates of what has been incurred by customers 
actual costs incurred by us may differ significantly if factors such as the level and success of the customers programs or other conditions differ from expectations 
we could experience a material goodwill impairment 
our assets include a substantial amount of goodwill 
this is a result of the acquisition of vsf 
the value of this goodwill is assessed at least annually 
if future operating performance at this business unit were to fall significantly below current levels  a non cash charge to operating earnings for goodwill impairment could result 
government regulations including any future claims could have a negative impact 
local authorities measure and assess the amount of certain pollutants discharged from the chicago facility and entering the wastewater treatment system 
these authorities have the power to fine or temporarily close that production facility 
furthermore  the quality of our products is regulated by the fda and failure to comply with regulations could result in a product recall or temporary closure of a facility 
certain of our employees are covered under a collective bargaining agreement 
our production employees at the chicago facility  other than supervisors  are represented by the local united food commercial workers  international union and maintenance employees are represented by the local international union of operating engineers 
although we consider our labor relations to be good  a strike  walkout or lockout occurred for a significant period of time could have an adverse affect on results of operations 
we could be exposed to increased costs and risks associated with complying with increasing and new regulations of corporate governance and disclosure standards 
the sec has postponed  for one year  the compliance date for reporting on internal controls by non accelerated filers 
despite this postponement  we expect to continue to spend an increased amount of management time and internal and external resources to comply with changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure  including the sarbanes oxley act of  new sec regulations and american stock exchange rules 
in particular  section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires management s annual review and evaluation of our internal control system and attestations of the effectiveness of these systems by our independent auditors 
we will be documenting and testing internal control systems and procedures and considering improvements that could be necessary in order for us to comply with the requirements of section by the end of this process may require us to hire outside advisory services and has resulted in additional accounting and legal expenses 
while we believe that we currently have adequate internal controls over financial reporting  in the event that the chief executive officer  chief financial officer or independent auditors determine that the controls over financial reporting are not effective as defined under section  investors perceptions of us could be adversely affected and could cause a decline in the market price of our stock

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
comparison of year ended december  and year ended december  revenues 
net sales for the year ended december  were  compared to  for  a decrease of  or 
of this decrease   is attributable to the vita specialty foods segment  which had revenues of  representing a reduction of and  is attributable to the vita seafood segment  which had revenues of  representing a decrease of 
the decrease for the vita specialty food segment is largely a reflection of the sales of honey products  which were down  and salad dressing products which were down  the decrease in honey sales is a result of a decrease in average selling price  since there was actually more pounds of honey sold in than in these lower prices followed the open market pricing for this commodity 
salad dressing sales decreased primarily as a result of sales broker transition issues which affected one key regional market 
partially offsetting the decline in sales of these vita specialty food product lines was an improvement of returns and allowances for this business unit of  primarily due to reduced sales promotional programs 
in addition to the decrease from the vita specialty foods segment was a decline of  or for the vita seafood segment  which was primarily the result of an  decrease in gross sales of herring products reflecting both the loss of a significant co pack customer which is no longer in business and reduced volume with a major wholesale club 
this decrease in the herring product line was partially offset by a  increase for salmon products  primarily reflecting the success of marketing for both colored and natural products and an improvement of  for sales returns and allowances resulting from reduced promotional costs 
gross margin 
gross margin for the year ended december  was  compared to  for  a decrease of  or 
the vita seafood segment accounted for a  increase but the vita specialty foods segment  following the large sales decline  incurred a  decrease 
the increased gross margin for the vita seafood segment  in the face of lower sales  was a result of both this segment s ability to pass along a portion of the cost increases by focusing on product pricing and on the reduction of sales return and allowance costs 
as a percentage of net sales  gross margin totaled  which was percentage point above the prior year result 
gross margin for the vita specialty foods segment  as a percentage of net sales rose to  compared to the prior year result  as the sales decrease occurred largely in the lower margin honey product line 
the vita seafood segment s gross margin  as a percentage of net sales  also increased  rising to in from in  this was primarily due to a combination of strategic pricing decisions  reduced sales returns and allowances and a sales mix shift away from the lower margin resale salmon product and in favor of the higher margin colored and natural lines 
operating expenses 
selling  marketing  distribution and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were  compared to  for  a decrease of  or 
as a percentage of net sales  however  these expenses rose to from for the vita specialty foods segment accounted for a decrease of  with an increase of  attributable to the vita seafood segment 
the total reduction reflects a  decrease for selling  marketing and distribution and a  increase in administrative expenses 
the vita specialty foods segment is primarily responsible for the improvement in selling  marketing and distribution expenses 
this improvement primarily reflects lower total salespersons compensation expenses of  largely as a result of the budd settlement and additional reductions in proportion with the volume decrease plus a reduction of freight out and other distribution related expenses totaling  which results from both the overall lower sales volume and from a greater portion of the current year sales being concentrated in large volume transactions 
the decrease in selling  marketing and distribution was partially offset by a  increase in administrative spending 
this can be explained by increased professional fees totaling  reflecting  among other things  the cost of work performed for the stockholders rights plan  acquisition investigations and the sarbanes oxley initiative 
employment contract charge 
during the fourth quarter of a  non cash charge was recognized to account for the future costs associated with a senior executive officer  pursuant to a amendment to his employment contract  which significantly reduced his duties during and committed the company to terminate the agreement in the company expects to pay  in without the benefit of any services from the officer and  in as severance 
goodwill impairment charge 
during the fourth quarter of  the company completed its annual assessment of impairment regarding the goodwill recorded as a result of the virginia honey acquisition  and the halifax acquisition 
this assessment  supported by an independent appraisal of the fair value of vsf was made using customary valuation methodologies including discounted cash flows and fundamental analysis  did reveal impairment issues 
the appraisal reflected a decreased fair value of vsf  principally caused by the decline in operating income of vsf during that decline was primarily a result of a substantial decline in the sales of halifax products which were down  or in based on the appraised value of vsf  the resulting impairment charge of approximately  was recorded in the fourth quarter of the appraisal did not result in additional impairment 
interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the same period in  an increase of  or 
this increase was primarily attributable to higher interest rates on the company s bank loan facilities as detailed under liquidity and capital resources third party financing and in note of
