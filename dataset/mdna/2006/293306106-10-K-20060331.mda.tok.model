item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion is qualified in its entirety by  and should be read in conjunction with  our consolidated financial statements including the notes thereto  included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
note to the financial statements contains segment information 
overview we furnish engineering consulting and control system services to the petroleum refining  petrochemical  pipeline  production and processing industries 
our business consists of two segments engineering and systems 
our engineering segment offers engineering consulting services to clients for the development  management and turnkey execution of engineering projects  construction management  and inspection services 
our systems segment designs  assembles  programs  installs  integrates and services control and instrumentation systems for specific applications in the energy and processing related industries 
the company s revenue is composed of engineering  construction and procurement service revenue and product sales 
the company recognizes service revenue as soon as the services are performed 
the majority of the company s engineering services have historically been provided through cost plus contracts whereas a majority of the company s product sales are earned on fixed price contracts 
in the course of providing our services  we routinely provide engineering  materials  equipment and may provide construction services on a subcontractor basis 
generally  these materials  equipment and subcontractor costs are passed through to our clients and reimbursed  along with fees  which in total are at margins lower than those of our normal core business 
in accordance with industry practice and generally accepted accounting principles  all costs and fees are included in revenue 
the use of subcontractor services can change significantly from project to project  therefore  changes in revenue may not be indicative of business trends 
for analytical purposes only  we have historically segregated from our total revenue the revenues derived from material assets or companies acquired during the first months following their respective dates of acquisition and referred to such revenue as acquisition revenue 
we also segregate gross profits and sg a expenses derived from material assets or company acquisitions on the same basis as we segregate revenues 
we analyze  for internal purposes only  the percentage of our revenue that comes from staffing services versus the percentage that comes from engineering services  as engineering services have a higher margin than staffing services 
operating sg a expense includes management and staff compensation  office costs such as rents and utilities  depreciation  amortization  travel and other expenses generally unrelated to specific client contracts  but directly related to the support of a segment s operation 
corporate sg a expense is comprised primarily of marketing costs  as well as costs related to the executive  governance investor relations  finance  accounting  safety  human resources  project controls and information technology departments and other costs generally unrelated to specific client projects  but which can vary as costs are incurred to support corporate activities and initiatives 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation continued results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain financial data derived from our consolidated statements of operations and indicates the percentage of total revenue for each item 
the manufacturing segment is reported in income loss from discontinued operations 
years ended december  amount amount amount in thousands revenue engineering    systems    acquisition    total revenue    gross profit engineering    systems    acquisition   total gross profit    selling  general and administrative non acquisition    acquisition  total    income from continuing operations    income loss on discontinued operations net income    total revenue increased or million from to overall gross profit increased  or million  from to total sg a expense increased  or million  in income from continuing operations increased  or million 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation continued year ended december  compared to year ended december  total revenue engineering revenue accounted for of our total revenue for the year  increasing million from million in to million in the increase in engineering revenue was primarily brought about by increased activity in the engineering and construction markets 
refining related activity has been particularly strong  including projects to satisfy environmental mandates  expand existing facilities and utilize heavier sour crude 
acquisitions in the fourth quarter of  together with our client s increased demand for in house technical and inspection resources  stimulated growth in our staffing services division where revenues increased  or million  from million in to million in revenue from procurement services increased  or million  from to and contributed  or million  of the increase in total engineering revenue during the same period 
the level of procurement services will vary depending on the volume of procurement activity our customers choose to do themselves as opposed to using our services on the larger epc contracts 
in  the company was awarded two significant fixed price engineering  procurement and construction epc projects in the refining industry that includes procurement and subcontractor activities within our scope of work 
the shift to more fixed price  epc type projects is expected to continue into and beyond as clients look to sole source responsibility on the larger projects 
the systems segment contributed of our total revenue for the year  as its revenue increased million  or  from million in to million in revenue in a general turnaround in the oil and gas industry has helped to increase the demand for esi s services 
projects from one major supplier of distributed control systems dcs equipment  together with projects from a large engineering and construction firm  contributed most of the increase in revenue in the completion of turnkey remote instrument enclosures rie s from projects awarded in the fourth quarter of contributed million to esi s revenue in backlog for esi at december  reached million 
acquisition revenue  representing only of total revenue for  increased  or million  during the comparable periods  primarily from nine months of revenue generated in through acquisitions completed in the th quarter of we formerly operated a third segment  the manufacturing segment 
certain assets of this segment were sold in december and its financial results during are reported in income loss from discontinued operations 
gross profit total gross profit increased million  or  from million in to million in although  as a percentage of total revenue  decreased slightly from to during the same period 
gross profit from engineering increased million  or  from million in to million in and  as a percentage of revenue  increased from in to in gross profit was negatively impacted by approximately  during due to start up expenses and non reimbursable proposal activity conducted by two of the company s internal start up initiatives  englobal sulfur group and englobal automation group 
the staffing services division increased gross profit million  or  from million in to million in on margins remaining relatively stable over the comparable periods  although such margins are approximately lower than average margins on all other engineering revenues 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation continued we earn a lower margin on procurement services as compared to the margin we earn on our core engineering services 
in  million  or of the increase in our total revenue was from procurement services  providing a gross profit margin 
comparably  gross profit margin on core engineering services was 
in  procurement services produced a 
gross profit margin 
due to the increase in procurement services in over  our overall gross profit  as a percentage of total revenue  was negatively impacted by and  respectively 
again  the shift to more fixed price epc type projects will negatively impact engineering gross profit as a percentage of revenue because higher historical cost plus margins on engineering labor recognized during the period in which it was earned will now be combined with the lower margins on procurement services and construction subcontractor charges and recorded throughout the overall duration and completion of the projects 
gross profit for our systems segment increased  or  from million in to million in however  as a percent of revenue  gross profit decreased by from in to in the lower margin in is a result of several factors 
the increase in the workload created a shortage in shop labor which was filled by hiring contract labor leading to inefficiencies and rework 
this led to overruns in shop labor on projects  thus dropping margins below already tight budgeted margins 
secondly  with the increase in proposal work  estimates of material and labor cost were underestimated  thus causing lower profit margins 
lastly  market pressures have driven down margins on projects overall 
corrective measures have been taken during the first quarter of to replace all contract labor with more stable  direct hire employees 
additional staffing and systems within the estimating and proposal group should improve proposal pricing 
during the fourth quarter  esi experienced delays in receiving major components for a project that were being supplied by a third party vendor 
as a result  the work esi expected to perform on such project during will be completed in  resulting in a corresponding delay in our recognition of revenues and profits 
one current project representing of the systems segment s backlog at december  has a budgeted margin 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  from million in to million in  primarily due to increases in salaries and burdens  facilities and office expenses  and travel 
however  as a percent of revenue  sg a decreased 
from in to in salaries and burden expenses increased million in over million of this increase was related to additional incentives paid under the incentive plans 
an additional million of the increase was due to increases in corporate salaries  primarily in business development  accounting and project controls  to support company growth 
the remainder of the increase came from increases in operation salaries and burdens primarily due to increases in administrative staffing from acquisitions  eag s start up during the year  esi s expansion into the beaumont area  and increases in their administrative support staffing in the houston facility  plus additional overhead due to the growth of eei s offices in beaumont and tulsa 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation continued facilities and office expenses increased million in over due to the expansion of eei s offices in tulsa  houston  dallas  and beaumont to meet both current and projected growth requirements  plus the additional cost of facilities utilized by acquisitions made in the fourth quarter of increased business development activity pushed marketing and travel expenses up by almost  in over similar expenses in operating profit operating profit increased million to million in as compared to million in  increasing  as a percentage of total revenue  from in to in although operating profit for exceeded operating profit for  our net operating profit for the fourth quarter of was down approximately million  or  over third quarter operating results  primarily due to losses of approximately  in start up expenses and non reimbursable proposal activity conducted by two of the company s internal start up initiatives  englobal sulfur group and eag 
for  the combined operating loss for both groups was approximately  other income expense other income decreased from  in to  in the income in resulted from a legal settlement 
the income in was derived from distributions from pei investments  insurance proceeds from hurricane rita losses  and income from the sale of assets  partially offset by a reclassification of financing costs 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation continued year ended december  compared to year ended december  total revenue total engineering revenue accounted for of our total revenue for the year  increasing million from million in revenue in to million in revenue in revenue from procurement services increased million in  or of the total increase in engineering revenue 
this was the result of additional revenue of million on a co generation project that began in  offset by million in lower revenue from a cyclohexane project that began in the remaining increase of million in revenue came from an additional million through the tulsa office  million through the beaumont office and million from all other office locations 
our engineering segment has been successful in obtaining major projects in the petroleum refining industry in the mid continent area for the tulsa office  but we do not currently have a project that would replace the co generation project when it is completed in the beaumont office 
in  the company was awarded two significant projects to be completed primarily out of our tulsa office 
coffeyville resources refining marketing  llc crrm has entered into an agreement with englobal for detailed engineering and procurement services for crrm s ultra low sulfur diesel fuel facilities at its coffeyville  kansas refinery on a cost reimbursable basis 
we estimate that the agreement will result in approximately  man hours in engineering and related activities in addition to a significant amount of revenue attributable to the procurement of materials and equipment 
the project began in january and is scheduled to conclude in the third quarter of frontier refining  inc has awarded englobal a contract to provide lump sum turnkey services for engineering  procurement and construction for modifications to produce ultra low sulfur diesel at frontier s cheyenne  wyoming refinery 
the company estimates revenue from the frontier contract to be approximately million 
the project began in february and is scheduled to complete in the spring of the systems segment contributed of our total revenue for the year  as its revenue declined  from million in to million in revenue in our systems segment began with a project backlog of million  representing the largest booking of new work in the segment s history 
during the fourth quarter of  the systems segment was awarded projects totaling million from honeywell to build eight turnkey remote instrument enclosures ries of which six units are scheduled for completion during the second quarter and additional units following in the third and fourth quarters of in the first quarter of  honeywell awarded the company three additional turnkey ries totaling million with one unit scheduled for delivery in the second quarter and two units scheduled for delivery in the fourth quarter of item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation continued revenue from acquired companies accounted for of our total revenue during  increasing by million or from million in revenue in to million in revenue in revenue recognized from acquired assets or companies during the first months of their operation within englobal is referred to as acquisition revenue 
acquisition revenue in includes revenue of million  million  million  million and  from edg  cis  petro chem  senftleber and amtech  respectively 
we formerly operated a third segment  the manufacturing segment 
certain assets of this segment were sold in december and march and its financial results during and are reported in income loss from discontinued operations 
gross profit gross profit from our engineering segment decreased  from million in to million in gross profit declined as a percent of revenue from in to in this decrease was the result of higher non project labor cost invested in estimating larger epc projects and in internal growth initiatives such as low sulfur diesel 
margins from our field service operations were lower by 
primarily due to the impact of integration costs and recognition of lower profits on million in revenue generated by the acquisition of cis during the last quarter of gross profit for our systems segment increased  or from million in to million in competitive market pressures on pricing  project management  cost containment against project budgets  and stronger support service controls continue to provide challenges for management in response to growth initiatives and record backlog levels 
the acquisition of contract rights and other assets from infotech during the fourth quarter of could have a short term negative impact on the systems segment s gross profit until new employees and new projects are fully integrated into the company s operations 
gross profits from acquisitions increased million or from  in to million in gross profit from acquired assets or companies during their first months of operations within the company is recorded and referred to as acquisition gross profit 
acquisition gross profit in includes gross profit of     and  from edg  cis  petro chem  senftleber and amtech  respectively 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation continued selling  general and administrative sg a expenses selling  general and administrative expenses not related to acquisitions decreased  from million in to million in depreciation expenses of  were reclassed from sg a expenses to direct costs for presentation in the consolidated statements of income included herein in as depreciation expense in related to direct costs was immaterial  no reclassification was made for that year 
in march  the company announced organizational changes intended to reduce overhead and enhance profitability 
the company eliminated four operational facilities and consolidated offices to improve efficiency 
for example  effective january  within the systems segment  ecp relocated offices and shop facilities into the same facility as esi resulting in improved shop personnel utilization  reduction of duplicative overhead functions and reduction of facility expenses 
as a result  during  the systems segment sg a expenses decreased  or from million in to million in corporate sg a charges increased  due to additional software enhancements to our billings system to meet client format demands  plus  related to proposal and internal growth initiatives 
engineering sg a expenses increased  due to numerous miscellaneous items 
sg a expenses from acquisitions increased million from  in to million in sg a expenses from acquired assets or companies during their first months of operations within the company have been recorded and are referred to as acquisition under sg a expenses 
acquisition sg a in includes million   and  from edg  cis  petro chem respectively  plus  for all other acquisition activity 
operating profit operating profit remained constant at million in and  decreasing as a percentage of total revenue from in to in other income expense other income expense changed from  expense in to  income in the expense in was the result of a book basis loss on the sale of the vacant office building in baton rouge  as compared to the income in  which resulted from a legal settlement 
liquidity and capital resources historically  we have satisfied our cash requirements through operations and borrowings under a revolving credit facility 
the company s current credit facility is with comerica bank comerica and consists of a line of credit maturing july  the loan agreement positions comerica as senior to all other debt 
the line of credit is limited to million subject to loan covenant restrictions 
the comerica credit facility is collateralized by substantially all the assets of the company 
as of december   the outstanding balance on the line of credit was million and we had working capital of million 
our total long term debt outstanding on december  was million see note  a decrease from million as of december  under the terms and conditions of our revolving credit facility  as of december   we have additional borrowing capacity of approximately million after consideration of borrowing base limitations and outstanding letters of credit of million at december  on september   we entered into and closed on a definitive agreement to issue and sell  shares of our 
par value per share common stock in a private placement to tontine capital partners  lp  a delaware limited partnership 
the purchase agreement provided  in gross proceeds which were used to pay down our existing line of credit debt 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation continued the company has been awarded a significant project with a central states refinery and entered into an agreement for engineering and procurement services to provide detailed engineering and procurement services for ultra low sulphur diesel fuel facilities on a cost reimbursable basis 
the terms of the agreement require that any progress payments made by our client for engineered and manufactured project items must be secured by one or more irrevocable stand by letters of credit issued on the account of englobal 
the project began in january and is scheduled to complete in the third quarter of the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december payments due by period and total thereafter in thousands long term debt   operating leases       total contractual cash obligations       long term debt includes future interest payments assuming the existing long term debt and revolving credit facility remain outstanding with the interest rate in effect at december  the company s interest rate on its revolving credit facility fluctuates with the prime rate 
cash flow operating activities required the use of  and million in net cash for the fiscal years ended december  and december   respectively 
though a decline in revenues would be likely to adversely impact our cash flow from operations  we believe that future cash flows  our ability to manage the timing of acquisitions  and our borrowing capacity under our line of credit will allow us to meet cash requirements in and beyond 
future uses of cash in operations will continue to be primarily for labor and material costs required in connection with contract performance 
our cash flow has been negatively impacted beginning in the fourth quarter of by a slow down in our ability to invoice certain clients primarily due to the temporary relocation of the accounting department to houston in early october followed by its relocation to beaumont in mid november 
in addition  we have experienced slower collections of our accounts receivable from our beaumont and lake charles customers as a result of hurricanes rita and katrina 
the accounting and invoice functions are fully restored and we believe the collection situation is temporary pending recovery from the hurricanes 
investing activities used cash totaling million in  compared to in and  in in  our investing activities consisted of capital additions of million primarily for computers and leasehold improvements to our offices 
in the first quarter of  we completed the sale of the thermaire building  receiving  in cash from the sale 
we used  in the fourth quarter of to complete the acquisitions of edgi  amtech  cleveland inspection services  inc  and infotech 
future investing activities are anticipated to remain consistent with prior years and include capital additions for leasehold improvements  technical applications software  and equipment  such as upgrades to computers 
on december   we amended our line of credit to permit an increase in annual capital expenditure limits from million to million 
financing activities provided cash totaling million and million in and  respectively 
financing activities used million during our primary financing mechanism is our revolving line of credit 
the line of credit has been used principally to finance accounts receivable 
during  our borrowings  on the line of credit were million  and we repaid an aggregate of million on our short term and long term bank and other debt 
on september   we reduced our outstanding line of credit by million using cash generated from working capital and the sale of  shares of our common stock in a private placement 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation continued future cash flows from financing activities are anticipated to be borrowings  payments on the line of credit and payments on long term debt instruments 
line of credit fluctuations are a function of timing related to operations  obligations and payments received on accounts receivable 
payments on long term debt  including interest for the coming year  are estimated to be  in addition  our cash flow was impacted during the fourth quarter of by our decision to pay million in insurance renewals rather than financing that payment  by investing million in capital expenditures and by funding our growth 
we also extended hardship allowances in an aggregate amount of  to a number of our employees to assist them with hurricane recovery 
most of this amount has been repaid 
the company s requirement on its letters of credit for a major project has declined from million in january to million in february we believe that all letter of credit obligations on this project will be fulfilled by may there were no significant non cash transactions in in  non cash transactions include million notes payable issued related to acquisitions and  note payable issued for treasury stock 
during  our preferred stock was converted to common stock valued at million 
we also acquired insurance with notes payable of  million  and million in   and  respectively 
the company believes that it has available necessary cash for operations for the next months 
cash and the availability of cash could be materially restricted if circumstances prevent the timely internal processing of invoices into accounts receivable  if such accounts are not collected timely  or if our project mix shifts from cost reimbursable to fixed cost contracts during significant periods of growth 
if losses occur  we may not be able to meet our monthly fixed charge ratio covenant under our credit facility with comerica 
in that event  if we are unable to obtain a waiver or amendment of the covenant  we may be unable to make further borrowings and may be required to repay all loans then outstanding under the credit facility 
we do not hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes or otherwise 
furthermore  we have not engaged in energy or commodity trading activities and do not anticipate doing so in the future  nor do we have any transactions involving unconsolidated entities or special purpose entities 
asset management we typically sell our products and services on short term credit and seek to minimize our credit risk by performing credit checks and conducting our own collection efforts 
our trade accounts receivable increased to million from million as of december  and  respectively  primarily due to increased revenue growth 
the number of days outstanding for trade accounts receivable decreased from days at december  to days at december  our actual bad debt expense has been approximately and of revenues for the periods ending december  and we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts from  to  or and of the trade accounts receivable balance for and  respectively 
related party transactions englobal engineering  inc leases office space from pei investments  a joint venture in which englobal engineering  inc has a one third interest  michael l 
burrow the company s ceo has a one third interest  and a stockholder who owns less than of the company s common stock has a one third interest 
rentals paid under the lease were   and  for  and  respectively 
the lease was renewed in august in september  the building was damaged by hurricane rita and all tenants have relocated to other locations 
no further lease payments have been made by the company since september and the insurance claim filed by pei investments remains unsettled 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation continued risk management in performing services for our clients  we could potentially be liable for breach of contract  personal injury  property damage or negligence  including professional errors and omissions 
we often agree to indemnify our clients for losses and expenses incurred as a result of our negligence and  in certain cases  the concurrent negligence of our clients 
our quality control and assurance program includes a control function to establish standards and procedures for performance and for documentation of project tasks  and an assurance function to audit and to monitor compliance with procedures and quality standards 
we maintain liability insurance for bodily injury and third party property damage  professional errors and omissions  and workers compensation coverage  which we consider sufficient to insure against these risks  subject to self insured amounts 
seasonality holidays and employee vacations during our fourth quarter exert downward pressure on revenues for that quarter  which is only partially offset by the year end efforts on the part of many clients to spend any remaining funds budgeted for engineering services or capital expenditures during the year 
the annual budgeting and approval process under which these clients operate is normally not completed until after the beginning of each new year  which can depress results for the first quarter 
principally due to these factors  our revenues during the first and fourth quarters generally tend to be lower than in the second and third quarters 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition because the majority of the company s revenues are recognized under cost plus contracts  significant estimates are generally not involved in determining revenue recognition 
in addition  most of our contracts are with fortune companies 
as a result  collection risk is generally not a relevant factor in the recognition of revenue 
our revenues are largely composed of engineering service revenue and product sales 
the majority of our services are provided through time and material contracts also referred to as cost plus contracts  many of which have not to exceed provisions that place a cap on the revenue that we may receive under a particular contract 
these time and material billings are produced every two weeks 
on occasion  we serve as purchasing agent by procuring subcontractors  material and equipment on behalf of a client and passing the cost on to the client with no mark up or profit 
in accordance with statement of position sop  revenues and costs for these type purchases are not included in total revenues and costs 
for financial reporting this pass through type of transaction is reported net 
profits and losses on fixed fee contracts are recorded on the percentage of completion method of accounting  measured by the percentage of contract costs incurred to date to estimated total contract costs for each contract 
contract costs include amounts paid to subcontractors 
anticipated losses on uncompleted construction contracts are charged to operations as soon as such losses can be estimated 
changes in job performance  job conditions  estimated profitability and final contract settlements may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
the asset  costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts  represents revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed on fixed fee contracts 
the liability billings in excess of costs and estimated profits on uncompleted contracts represents amounts billed in excess of revenues recognized on fixed fee contracts 
goodwill a change in assumptions in the estimation of the fair market value of the segments would unlikely give rise to an impairment of goodwill without deteriorating operating results in the segments 
in conjunction with each acquisition  we must allocate the cost of the acquired entity to the assets and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
as additional item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation continued information becomes available  adjustments may be made to the original estimates within a short time subsequent to the acquisition 
goodwill is not amortized but instead is periodically assessed for impairment 
the impairment testing entails estimating current market value of the segments  based on management s estimate of market conditions including pricing  demand  competition  operating costs and other factors 
determining the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired involves professional judgment and is ultimately based on management s assessment of the value of the assets acquired 
we believe our estimates for these items are reasonable  but there is no assurance that actual amounts will not vary significantly from estimated amounts 
consistent with sfas  we have not amortized goodwill related to the merger with petrocon  but instead tested the balance for impairment 
change orders change orders are modifications of an original contract that effectively change the provisions of the contract without adding new provisions 
either we or our clients may initiate change orders 
change orders may include changes in specifications or design  manner of performance  equipment  materials  scope of work  and or the period of completion of the project 
change orders occur when changes are experienced once a contract is begun 
change orders are sometimes documented and the terms of change orders are agreed with the client before the work is performed 
other times  circumstances may require that work progress without the client s written agreement before the work is performed 
costs related to change orders are recognized when they are incurred 
change orders are included in the total estimated contract revenue when it is probable that the change orders will result in a bona fide addition to value that can be reliably estimated 
we have a favorable history of negotiating and collecting for work performed under change orders and our bi weekly billing cycle has proven to be timely enough to properly account for change orders 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 revised share based payment sfas r 
this statement is a revision of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation as amended sfas  and requires entities to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
the cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award usually the vesting period 
sfas r covers various share based compensation arrangement rights and employee share purchase plans 
sfas r eliminates the ability to use the intrinsic value methods of accounting for share options  as provided in accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
sfas r is effective as of the beginning of the first interim period that begins after june   with early adoption encouraged 
the company is currently evaluating the statement s transition methods and does not expect this statement to have an effect materially different than that of the pro forma sfas disclosures provided in note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 exchanges of non monetary assets  an amendment of apb opinion no 
sfas 
this statement amends apb opinion no 
to permit the exchange of non monetary assets to be recorded on a carry over basis when the non monetary assets do not have commercial substance 
this is an exception to the basic measurement principal of measuring a non monetary asset exchange at fair value 
a non monetary asset exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
sfas is effective for non monetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  the adoption of this standard is not expected to impact the company s consolidated financial statements 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation continued in january  the financial accounting standard board fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  and addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities more commonly known as special purpose entities or spe s 
in december  fasb issued fin no 
r which replaced fin and clarified arb this interpretation provides guidance on how to identify a variable interest entity and determine when the assets  liabilities  non controlling interests and results of operations of a variable interest entity should be consolidated by the primary beneficiary 
the primary beneficiary is the enterprise that will absorb a majority of the variable interest entity s expected losses or receive a majority of the expected residual returns as a result of holding variable interests 
this fin requires the consolidation of results of variable interest entities in which the company is the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entity 
as of december   the company did not own an interest in a variable interest entity that met the consolidation requirements and as such the adoption of fin no 
r did not have any effect on the financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity of the company 
interests in entities acquired or created after december  will be evaluated based on fin no 
r criteria and consolidated  if required 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december  and  the company did not participate in any derivative financial instruments or other financial and commodity instruments for which fair value disclosure would be required under sfas no there are no investments at december  accordingly  the company has no quantitative information concerning the market risk of participating in such investments 
as of december  and  the company did not participate in any derivative financial instruments or other financial and commodity instruments for which fair value disclosure would be required under sfas no 
the company s primary interest rate risk relates to its variable rate line of credit debt obligation  which totaled million and million as of december  and  respectively 
assuming a increase in the interest rate on this variable rate debt obligation ie  an increase from the actual average interest rate of as of december   to an average interest rate of  annual interest expense would have been approximately  higher in based on the annual average balance 
the company does not have any interest rate swap or exchange agreements 
the company has no market risk exposure in the areas of interest rate risk from investments because the company did not have an investment portfolio as of december  currently  the company does not engage in foreign currency hedging activities 
transactions in canadian dollars in our canadian subsidiary have been translated into us dollars using the current rate method  such that assets and liabilities are translated at the rates of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date and revenue and expenses are translated at the average rates of exchange during the appropriate fiscal period 
as a result  the carrying value of the company s investments in canada is subject to the risk of foreign currency fluctuations 
additionally  any revenues received from the company s international operations in other than us dollars will be subject to foreign exchange risk
