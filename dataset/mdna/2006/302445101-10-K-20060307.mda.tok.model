item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview flir was founded in  originally providing infrared imaging systems that were installed on vehicles for use in conducting energy audits of neighborhoods by helping to determine whether there was any abnormal leakage of heat coming from the doors  windows  walls and roofs of each house 
as demand for that application declined  we began to focus on other applications and markets for our technology  in particular  designing and selling stabilized thermal imaging systems for aircraft used by law enforcement 
since then  we have continued to develop thermal imaging products for a growing number of applications and have now become one of the world leaders in the design  manufacture and marketing of thermal imaging and stabilized camera systems for a wide variety of applications in the commercial  industrial and government markets  internationally as well as domestically 
our business is now organized around two principal business segments  thermography and imaging 
our thermography market primarily consists of the use of hand held thermal imaging systems that can detect and measure minute temperature differences  which is useful for a wide variety of industrial and commercial applications 
uses for our thermography products include predictive and preventative maintenance  process control  condition monitoring  moisture detection  commercial and residential building inspection and scientific analysis 
our thermography products are produced at our facilities in stockholm  boston and santa barbara 
a growing distribution network has enabled us to penetrate existing and emerging markets and applications worldwide 
our imaging business offers a wide array of products  all of which allow the user to see in total darkness  and through many types of obscurants  such as smoke  haze and most types of fog 
product offerings include hand held and fixed mounted products for ground  airborne and maritime applications 
applications for our imaging products include force protection  counter terrorism  search and rescue  perimeter security  navigation safety  law enforcement  narcotics detection  maritime and border patrol  electronic news gathering  anti piracy and firefighting 
our imaging products are primarily produced at our portland  boston  santa barbara and stockholm facilities 
a substantial portion of our revenue in the imaging business is derived from sales to government agencies and we are continuing to expand our military program business  both in the united states and internationally 
our acquisition of indigo systems corporation indigo  a leading producer of infrared detectors  infrared cameras  and camera subsystems which is located in santa barbara  california  provides us with the ability to design and produce infrared detectors for both our imaging and thermography business 
indigo has also allowed us to expand our presence in certain markets  including high end scientific cameras  oem s and certain military program markets 
international revenue accounted for approximately  and of our revenue in  and  respectively 
we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant percentage of revenue 
we have exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations and changing dynamics of foreign competitiveness based on variations in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies 
factors contributing to this variability include significant manufacturing activity in stockholm  significant sales denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  and cross currency fluctuations between such currencies as the us dollar  euro and swedish kroner 
during  there were significant fluctuations in the values of the major currencies in which we conduct business  in particular  a strengthening of the us dollar against the swedish kroner 
the impact of those fluctuations is reflected throughout our consolidated financial statements  but in aggregate  did not have a material impact on our results of operations 
we typically experience longer payment cycles on our international sales  which can have an adverse impact upon our liquidity 
in addition  substantial portions of our operations are conducted outside the united states  
table of contents including manufacturing in stockholm and sales operations worldwide 
international sales and operations may be subject to risks such as the imposition of governmental controls  export license requirements  restrictions on the export of critical technology  political and economic instability  trade restrictions  labor union activities  changes in tariffs and taxes  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  and general economic conditions 
we experience fluctuations in orders and sales due to seasonal variations and customer sales cycles  such as the seasonal pattern of contracting by the us and certain foreign governments  the frequent requirement by certain customers to take delivery of equipment prior to the end of december due to funding considerations  and the tendency of commercial enterprises to fully utilize annual capital budgets prior to expiration 
such events have resulted and could continue to result in certain fluctuations in quarterly results in the future 
as a result of such quarterly fluctuations in operating results  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  inventories  investments  goodwill impairment  warranty obligations  contingencies and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
we believe the following critical accounting policies and the related judgments and estimates affect the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
the majority of our revenue is recognized upon delivery of the product to the customer at a fixed or determinable price and with a reasonable assurance of collection  passage of title to the customer as indicated by the shipping terms and fulfillment of all significant obligations  pursuant to guidance provided by staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab  issued by the securities and exchange commission in december we typically design  market and sell our products as commercial  off the shelf products 
many of our imaging customers  particularly those who use our airborne systems  request different system configurations  based on standard options or accessories that we offer 
in general  our revenue arrangements do not involve acceptance provisions based upon customer specified acceptance criteria 
in those limited circumstances when customer specified acceptance criteria exist  revenue is deferred until customer acceptance if we cannot demonstrate the system meets those specifications prior to shipment 
for any contracts with multiple elements ie  training  installation  additional parts undelivered at the end of a reporting period  we recognize revenue on the delivered elements only after we have determined that the delivered elements have stand alone value and any undelivered elements have objective and reliable evidence of fair value 
the recognition of revenue on contracts with multiple elements is consistent with guidance provided by eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
judgments are required in evaluating the credit worthiness of our customers 
credit is not extended to customers and revenue is not recognized until we have determined that the risk of uncollectibility is minimal 
we also have a limited number of design and development contracts  principally with governmental customers  that are accounted for in accordance with statement of position  accounting for performance of 
table of contents construction type and certain production type contracts sop 
under sop  revenues and related costs are recognized using the percentage of completion method 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
our policy is to maintain allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
credit limits are established through a process of reviewing the financial history and stability of each customer 
where appropriate  we obtain credit rating reports and financial statements of the customer when determining or modifying their credit limits 
we regularly evaluate the collectibility of our trade receivable balances based on a combination of factors 
when a customer s account balance becomes past due  we initiate dialogue with the customer to determine the cause 
if it is determined that the customer will be unable to meet its financial obligation to us  such as in the case of a bankruptcy filing  deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position or other material events impacting their business  we record a specific allowance to reduce the related receivable to the amount we expect to recover given all information presently available 
actual write offs during the past three years have been insignificant 
we also record an allowance for all other customers based on certain other factors including the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience with individual customers 
as of december   our accounts receivable balance of million is reported net of allowances for doubtful accounts of million 
we believe our reported allowances at december   are adequate 
if the financial conditions of those customers were to deteriorate  however  resulting in their inability to make payments  we may need to record additional allowances that would result in additional selling  general and administrative expenses being recorded for the period in which such determination is made 
inventory write downs 
as a designer and manufacturer of high technology infrared systems  we are exposed to a number of economic and industry factors that could result in portions of our inventories becoming either obsolete or in excess of anticipated usage 
these factors include  but are not limited to  technological changes in our markets  our ability to meet changing customer requirements  competitive pressures in products and prices  and the availability of key components from our suppliers 
our policy is to establish inventory write downs when conditions exist that suggest that our inventories may be in excess of anticipated demand or are obsolete based upon our assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions 
we regularly evaluate the ability to realize the value of our inventories based on a combination of factors including the following historical usage rates  forecasted sales or usage  product end of life dates  estimated current and future market values and new product introductions 
purchasing requirements and alternative usage avenues are explored within these processes to mitigate inventory exposure 
when recorded  our write downs are intended to reduce the carrying value of our inventories to their net realizable value and establish a new cost basis 
as of december   our inventories of million are stated net of inventory write downs of million 
if actual demand for our products deteriorates or market conditions are less favorable than those that we project  additional inventory write downs may be required 
cost basis investments 
we have invested in three third party entities 
the investments are accounted for on a cost basis since we do not have controlling interests in these entities nor do we have the ability to exercise significant influence on them 
as of december   we have carrying values of these investments of approximately million 
we periodically review the investments for impairment to determine if events or changes in the business conditions of those entities indicate the carrying value of our investments may not be recoverable 
these reviews may be based upon factors that include  but are not limited to  hypothetical liquidations of the investees at book value and current or recent financings received by the investees 
if future changes in business results or market conditions indicate that any impairment  other than temporary  exists on these investments  we may need to record reserves against those investments 
goodwill impairment 
we have recorded goodwill in connection with our business acquisitions 
we review goodwill in june of each year  or on an interim basis if required  for impairment to determine if events or changes in business conditions indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
such 
table of contents reviews assess the fair value of the assets based upon our estimates of the future cash flows we expect the assets to generate within the boundary of the overall market capitalization of the company 
our current review indicates that no adjustments are necessary for the goodwill assets  which have a carrying value of million as of december  in response to changes in industry and market conditions  we may be required to strategically realign our resources in the future which could result in an impairment of goodwill 
product warranties 
our products are sold with warranty provisions that require us to remedy deficiencies in quality or performance of our products over a specified period of time  generally twelve months  at no cost to our customers 
our policy is to establish warranty reserves at levels that represent our estimate of the costs that will be incurred to fulfill those warranty requirements at the time that revenue is recognized 
we believe that our recorded liability of million at december   is adequate to cover our future cost of materials  labor and overhead for the servicing of our products sold through that date 
if actual product failures or material or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  our warranty liability would need to be revised accordingly 
contingencies 
we are subject to the possibility of loss contingencies arising in the normal course of business 
we consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability  as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies 
an estimated loss is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted 
income taxes 
we record our deferred tax assets at an amount that we determine is more likely than not to be realized in the future 
valuation allowances against deferred tax assets are recorded when a determination is made that the deferred tax assets are not likely to be realized in the future 
in making that determination  we estimate our future taxable income based upon historical operating results and external market data 
future levels of taxable income are dependent upon  but not limited to  general economic conditions  competitive pressures  and other factors beyond our control 
as of december   we have determined that no valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets of million is required 
if we should determine that we may be unable to realize our deferred tax assets to the extent reported  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination is made 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the indicated periods certain items as a percentage of revenue 
year ended december  revenue cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative total operating expenses earnings from operations interest expense interest income other income expense  net earnings before income taxes income tax provision net earnings 
table of contents years ended december   and revenue 
revenue for totaled million  an increase of over the million in revenue in revenue from the imaging business segment increased from million in to million in revenue from the thermography business segment increased from million in to million in the slight increase in imaging revenue was primarily due to increases in the sales of airborne products  offset by a decrease in the sales of land products 
the increase in thermography revenue was primarily due to an increase in unit volumes  particularly of e series and oem products due to new markets and applications being identified and addressed 
revenue for totaled million  an increase of over the million in revenue in revenue from the imaging business segment increased from million in to million in revenue from the thermography business segment increased from million in to million in the increase in imaging revenue was primarily due to an increase in unit volumes arising from strong demand in virtually all markets  and to the revenue provided through our acquisition of indigo in january 
the increase in thermography revenue was primarily due to an increase in unit volumes  particularly of e series  p series and a series products  due to new and emerging markets and the increased penetration by our expanding distribution network 
international revenue in totaled million  representing of revenue 
this compares to international revenue in which totaled million  representing of revenue  and million  or of revenue in while the sales mix between domestic and international sales may fluctuate slightly from year to year  we anticipate the mix to be approximately to domestic and to international on a long term basis 
gross profit 
gross profit in was of revenue  compared to in the increase in gross profit is primarily due to the product mix within both our imaging and thermography segments  our ability to lower component costs  including successfully integrating indigo sensors into our products  production efficiencies at our imaging facilities  the product mix between the thermography and imaging segments and million of expense in related to the recognition of the one time stepped up values of the acquired inventories of indigo 
we historically experience higher gross margins in our thermography business than in our imaging business 
thermography represented of total revenue in compared to in gross profit in was of revenue  compared to in the gross profit for included million of amortization expense attributable to developed technology intangibles acquired as part of the acquisition of indigo and million of expense related to the recognition of the one time stepped up values of the acquired inventories of indigo 
the remaining decrease in gross profit was due to lower gross profits for our indigo products and a change in the mix of revenue between the imaging and thermography businesses  as thermography revenue represented of total revenue in compared to in offsetting a portion of these factors were manufacturing improvements and efficiencies implemented within the imaging operations 
research and development 
research and development expenses were million  or of revenue  in compared to million  or of revenue  in the increase in spending in was due to the continued investment in new products and engineering to enable future growth 
we believe that spending levels are sufficient to support the development of new products and the continued growth of the business 
we expect research and development expenses to represent to of our revenue on a long term basis 
research and development expenses were million  or of revenue  in compared to million  or of revenue  in the significant increase in spending in was due to the research and development expenses of indigo and the continued growth in spending related to our existing imaging and thermography businesses 

table of contents we have also incurred expenses associated with customer funded design and development contracts 
such expenses were million in  million in and million in these expenses are reported as cost of goods sold since the related funding is reported as revenue 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or of revenue in compared to million  or of revenue in included in selling  general and administrative expense are charges related to legal and professional fees associated with our indemnification and cost advancement payments on behalf of former officers who are the subject of criminal and civil enforcement actions 
such indemnification and cost advancement expenses totaled million and in and  respectively 
we anticipate selling  general and administrative expenses in the future to increase at a slower rate than revenue 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or of revenue in compared to million  or of revenue in the significant increase in spending in is due to the indigo acquisition  including amortization expense of million for certain customer and trademark intangible assets acquired  and due to the growth in the company s business during the year 
the decrease in expenses as a percentage of revenue was a result of the revenue increase during the year and the ability to manage spending growth at a lower level than the revenue growth 
interest expense 
interest expense totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in interest from to was primarily due to the interest on the convertible notes that were issued in june interest income 
interest income was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in interest income in was primarily due to a decrease in invested cash as a result of the indigo acquisition at the beginning of other income expense 
we reported other income of million for  and other expenses of million and million for and the other income expense is primarily currency gains and losses on transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our european operations 
other income in was primarily due to the us dollar strengthening against european currencies during the year while other expense in and was primarily due to the european currencies strengthening against the us dollar during those years 
income taxes 
our income tax provision was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the effective tax rates for  and were  and  respectively 
the mix in taxable income between our us and foreign operations impacted the income tax provisions in each of these years 
our effective tax rate is lower than the us federal tax rate of percent because of lower foreign tax rates  the effect of our current foreign tax structure which we established in the third quarter of and estimated tax credits 
during the fourth quarter of calendar year  we completed our evaluation of the repatriation provisions of the american jobs creation act of based upon this evaluation  we made the decision to repatriate million under the jobs act 
this repatriation caused the recognition of million  net of foreign tax credits  of tax expense 
this tax expense is reflected in current income tax expense for at december   we had us tax net operating loss carryforwards nol s totaling approximately million and state tax nol s totaling approximately million which expire in the years through additionally  we have various federal tax credits available aggregating million and various state tax credits available aggregating million net of federal benefit  which expire in the years through we have generated deductions for us tax purposes related to the exercise of stock options that have served to offset the reductions in our nol s 
the utilization of these stock option exercise deductions is accounted for as a direct increase in additional paid in capital rather than as a reduction in our income tax provision 

table of contents statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for income taxes requires that the tax benefits described above be recorded as assets to the extent that we assess the utilization of such assets to be more likely than not  otherwise  a valuation allowance is required to be recorded 
based on this guidance  we believe that the net deferred tax assets of million reflected on the december  consolidated balance sheet  is realizable based on future forecasts of taxable income over a relatively short time horizon and we have not recorded a valuation allowance 
future levels of taxable income are dependent upon general economic conditions  including but not limited to continued growth of the thermography and imaging markets  competitive pressures on sales and gross margins  successful implementation of tax planning strategies  and other factors beyond our control 
absolute assurance can not be given that sufficient taxable income will be generated for full utilization of the deferred tax assets 
accordingly  we may be required to record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets in future periods if our future forecasts of taxable income are not achieved 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents compared to million at december  the decrease in cash and cash equivalents is primarily from million used to repurchase approximately million shares of our common stock  capital expenditures of million  including the purchase of a building and associated property in wilsonville  oregon for million  and the acquisition of brysen optical corporation for million and scientific materials corporation for million  partially offset by the cash provided from operations of million and proceeds of million from the exercise of stock options and issuance of shares under the employee stock purchase plan 
cash provided by operating activities in totaled million compared to million in the decrease in cash provided from operating activities was primarily due to an increase in accounts receivables and the decrease in the income tax benefit related to the exercise of stock options  partially offset by an increase in net earnings 
at december   we had accounts receivable in the amount of million compared to million at december  the increase of million in the receivable balance was primarily due to the increase in revenue in the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of at december   we had inventories of million compared to million at december  the increase in inventories was consistent with the revenue growth during at december   we had prepaid expenses and other current assets of million compared to million at december  the increase was primarily due to overpayments of tax deposits in europe in and increases in advances to vendors 
our investing activities for the year ended december  totaled million  primarily arising from the purchase of the wilsonville  oregon property  and other capital expenditures  and the acquisition of brysen optical corporation and scientific materials corporation 
investing activities for the year ended december  totaled million  primarily due to the acquisition of indigo for million  net of cash acquired 
accounts payable increased from million at december  to million at december  the increase relates to the increase in inventories 
accrued payroll and related liabilities decreased from million at december  to million at december  the decrease was primarily due to the timing of payroll payments and lower bonus accruals 
on april   we signed an amended and restated credit agreement credit agreement with bank of america  na  union bank of california  na  and na bank national association 
the agreement provides 
table of contents for a million  five year revolving line of credit  with an option for an additional million until april  under the credit agreement  borrowings will bear interest based upon the prime lending rate of the bank of america or eurodollar rates with a provision for a spread under over such rates based upon our leverage ratio 
at december   the interest rate ranged from to 
the credit agreement contains four financial covenants that require the maintenance of certain leverage ratios  in addition to minimum levels of ebitda and consolidated net worth and a maximum level of capital expenditures  and is collateralized by substantially all our assets 
at december   we had no amounts outstanding under the credit agreement and were in compliance with these four financial covenants 
we had million of letters of credit outstanding under the credit agreement at december   which reduces the total available credit 
through two of our subsidiaries  we have a million swedish kroner approximately million line of credit at and a million line of credit at at december  at december   we had no amounts outstanding on these lines 
the million swedish kroner line of credit is secured primarily by accounts receivable and inventories of our sweden subsidiary and is subject to automatic renewal on an annual basis 
the million line of credit is secured by substantially all assets of our united kingdom subsidiary and is subject to renegotiation annually 
in june  we issued million of senior convertible notes due in a private offering pursuant to rule a under the securities act of  as amended 
the issuance was made through an initial offering of million on june   and the subsequent exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase an additional million on june  the net proceeds from the issuance were approximately million 
issuance costs are being amortized over a period of seven years 
interest is payable semiannually on june and december of each year 
the holders of the notes may convert all or some of their notes into shares of our common stock at a conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of notes prior to the maturity date in certain circumstances 
we may redeem for cash all or part of the notes on or after june  the proceeds were used primarily for general corporate purposes  which included the acquisition of indigo and other working capital and capital expenditure needs 
during the quarter ended september   one of the terms that allow for conversion of our convertible notes  as described in the prospectus  was met 
as of december   no note holders have elected to convert their notes into our stock 
we do not anticipate any conversions before we believe that our existing cash combined with the cash we anticipate to generate from operating activities  and our available credit facilities and financing available from other sources will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
we do not have any significant commitments nor are we aware of any significant events or conditions that are likely to have a material impact on our liquidity 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we leased our non owned facilities under operating lease agreements 
we also leased certain operating machinery and equipment and office equipment under operating lease agreements 
except for these operating lease agreements  we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 

table of contents contractual obligations as of december   our contractual obligations were as follows in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt interest on long term debt operating leases licensing rights post retirement obligations interest obligations on our long term debt are based upon the assumption that all convertible notes are held to maturity 
post retirement obligations are based upon actuarial assumptions 
actual payments may differ in terms of both timing and amounts 
recent accounting pronouncements see note to the consolidated financial statements in item for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our credit agreements 
the credit agreements are at variable rates 
a change in interest rates on the credit agreements impacts the interest incurred and cash flows 
at december   no amounts were outstanding on any of our credit agreements  consequently  no sensitivity analysis is presented 
our convertible notes carry interest at a fixed rate of 
for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes impact the fair value of the notes but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
the fair value of the notes at december   was approximately million compared to a carrying value of million 
we have assets  liabilities  and inventory purchase commitments outside the united states that are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
similarly  certain revenues from products sold in foreign countries are sold in foreign currencies 
assets and liabilities located outside the united states are primarily located in sweden and the united kingdom 
our investments in foreign subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the us dollar are considered long term 
we do not currently engage in forward currency exchange contracts or similar hedging activities to reduce our economic exposure to changes in exchange rates 
because we market  sell and license our products throughout the world  we could be significantly affected by weak economic conditions in foreign markets that could reduce demand for our products 
our net investment in foreign subsidiaries translated into us dollars using the period end exchange rates at december   was approximately million 
the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in foreign exchange rates would be approximately million at december  the increase in the potential loss in fair value is primarily due to the increase in the net investment of foreign subsidiaries 
the company has no plans of liquidating any of its foreign subsidiaries  and therefore  foreign exchange rate gains or losses on our foreign investments are reflected as a cumulative translation adjustment and do not reduce our reported net earnings
