item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
overview pennsylvania real estate investment trust  a pennsylvania business trust founded in and one of the first equity reits in the united states  has a primary investment focus on retail shopping malls and power and strip centers located in the mid atlantic region or in the eastern part of the united states 
our operating portfolio currently consists of a total of properties 
the retail portion of our portfolio contains properties in states and includes shopping malls and power and strip centers 
we also own one office property acquired as part of a mall acquisition that we classify as non strategic and is currently held for sale 
the retail properties have a total of approximately million square feet  of which we and partnerships or tenancy in common arrangements collectively  partnerships in which we own an interest own approximately million square feet 
the retail properties that we consolidate for financial reporting purposes have approximately million square feet  of which we own approximately million square feet 
properties that are owned by unconsolidated partnerships with third parties see below have approximately million square feet  of which approximately million square feet are owned by such partnerships 
our primary business is owning and operating shopping malls and power and strip centers 
we evaluate operating results and allocate resources on a property by property basis  and do not distinguish or evaluate our consolidated operations on a geographic basis 
no individual property constitutes more than of our consolidated revenue or assets  and thus the individual properties have been aggregated into one reportable segment based upon their similarities with regard to the nature of our properties and the nature of our tenants and operational processes  as well as long term financial performance 
in addition  no single tenant accounts for or more of our consolidated revenue  and none of our properties are located outside the united states 
we hold our interests in our portfolio of properties through our operating partnership  preit associates  lp preit associates 
we are the sole general partner of preit associates and  as of december   held an controlling interest in preit associates 
we consolidate preit associates for financial reporting purposes 
we hold our investments in seven of the operating retail properties in our portfolio through unconsolidated partnerships with third parties in which we own a interest 
we hold a non controlling interest in each unconsolidated partnership  and account for such partnerships using the equity method of accounting 
we do not control any of these equity method investees for the following reasons except for two properties that we co manage with our partner  all of the other entities are managed on a day to day basis by one of our other partners as the managing general partner in each of the respective partnerships 
in the case of the co managed properties  all decisions in the ordinary course of business are made jointly 
the managing general partner is responsible for establishing the operating and capital decisions of the partnership  including budgets  in the ordinary course of business 
all major decisions of each partnership  such as the sale  refinancing  expansion or rehabilitation of the property  require the approval of all partners 
voting rights and the sharing of profits and losses are generally in proportion to the ownership percentages of each partner 
we record the earnings from the unconsolidated partnerships using the equity method of accounting under the income statement caption entitled equity in income of partnerships rather than consolidating the results of the unconsolidated partnerships 
back to contents with our results 
changes in our investments in these entities are recorded in the balance sheet caption entitled investment in partnerships  at equity 
in the case of deficit investment balances  such amounts are recorded in investments in partnerships  deficit balances 
for further information regarding our unconsolidated partnerships  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
we provide our management  leasing and development services through preit services  llc  which generally develops and manages properties that we consolidate for financial reporting purposes  and preit rubin  inc pri  which develops and manages properties that we own interests in through partnerships with third parties and properties that are owned by third parties in which we do not have an interest 
one of our long term objectives is to obtain managerial control of as many of our assets as possible 
due to the nature of our existing partnership arrangements  we cannot anticipate when this objective will be achieved  if at all 
our revenues consist primarily of fixed rental income  additional rent in the form of expense reimbursements  and percentage rents rents that are based on a percentage of our tenants sales or a percentage of sales in excess of thresholds that are specified in the leases derived from our income producing retail properties 
we also receive income from our real estate partnership investments and from the management and leasing services pri provides 
our net income available to common shareholders increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in our net income resulted primarily from increased real estate revenues  gains on sales of interests in real estate and decreased general and administrative expenses  offset by higher property operating expenses  depreciation and amortization and interest expense 
in particular  our net income was impacted by the changes to real estate revenues  property operating expenses  interest expense and depreciation and amortization expense resulting from properties acquired or disposed of during and  and the impact on operating results of properties that are in various stages of redevelopment 
our net income available to common shareholders decreased by million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the primary reason for the decrease from to was the sale of the wholly owned multifamily properties in the second and third quarters of the multifamily properties generated net income from operations of million during the year ended december   and we recognized a gain on the sale of the wholly owned multifamily properties of million  resulting in income from discontinued operations of million net of minority interest of million for the year ended december  our and property acquisitions caused an increase in our real estate revenues  with a corresponding increase in property operating expenses  depreciation and amortization expense and interest expense for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  acquisitions  dispositions and development activities the company records its acquisitions based on estimates of fair value as determined by management  based on information available and on assumptions of future performance 
these allocations are subject to revisions  in accordance with gaap  during the twelve month periods following the closings of the respective acquisitions

critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that require the application of management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  often because of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements  management has made estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
in preparing the financial statements  management has utilized available information  including our past history  industry standards and the current economic environment  among other factors  in forming its estimates and judgments  giving due consideration to materiality 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
in addition  other companies may utilize different estimates  which may impact comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses 
the estimates and assumptions made by management in applying critical accounting policies have not changed materially during  and  except as otherwise noted  and none of these estimates or assumptions have proven to be materially incorrect or resulted in our recording any significant adjustments relating to prior periods 
we will continue to monitor the key factors underlying our estimates and judgments  but no change is currently expected 
set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies that management believes are critical to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
this summary should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of our accounting policies included in note to our consolidated financial statements 
our management makes complex or subjective assumptions and judgments with respect to applying its critical accounting policies 
in making these judgments and assumptions  management considers  among other factors events and changes in property  market and economic conditions  estimated future cash flows from property operations  and the risk of loss on specific accounts or amounts 
revenue recognition we derive over of our revenues from tenant rents and other tenant related activities 
tenant rents include base rents  percentage rents  expense reimbursements such as common area maintenance  real estate taxes and utilities  amortization of above and below market intangibles and straight line rents 
we record base rents on a straight line basis  which means that the monthly base rent income according to the terms of our leases with tenants is adjusted so that an average monthly rent is recorded for each tenant over the term of its lease 
when tenants vacate prior to the end of their lease  we accelerate amortization 
back to contents of any related unamortized straight line rent balances  and unamortized above market and below market intangible balances are amortized as a decrease or increase to real estate revenues  respectively 
percentage rents represent rental income that the tenant pays based on a percentage of its sales 
tenants that pay percentage rent usually pay in one of two ways either a percentage of their total sales or a percentage of sales over a certain threshold 
in the latter case  we do not record percentage rent until the sales threshold has been reached 
revenues for rents received from tenants prior to their due dates are deferred until the period to which the rents apply 
in addition to base rents  certain lease agreements contain provisions that require tenants to reimburse a fixed or pro rata share of real estate taxes and certain common area maintenance costs 
tenants generally make expense reimbursement payments monthly based on a budgeted amount determined at the beginning of the year 
during the year  our income increases or decreases based on actual expense levels and changes in other factors that influence the reimbursement amounts  such as occupancy levels 
subsequent to the end of the year  we prepare a reconciliation of the actual amounts due from tenants 
the difference between the actual amount due and the amounts paid by the tenant throughout the year is billed or credited to the tenant  depending on whether the tenant paid too little or too much during the year 
lease termination fee income is recognized in the period when a termination agreement is signed and we are no longer obligated to provide space to the tenant 
in the event that a tenant is in bankruptcy when the termination agreement is signed  termination fee income is deferred and recognized when it is received 
our other main source of revenue comes from the provision of management services to third parties  including property management  brokerage  leasing and development 
management fees generally are a percentage of managed property revenues or cash receipts 
leasing fees are earned upon the consummation of new leases 
development fees are earned over the time period of the development activity and are recognized on the percentage of completion method 
these activities collectively are included in management company revenue in the consolidated statements of income 
real estate land  buildings  fixtures and tenant improvements are recorded at cost and stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred 
renovations or replacements  which improve or extend the life of an asset  are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives 
for financial reporting purposes  properties are depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
the estimated useful lives are as follows buildings years land improvements years furniture fixtures years tenant improvements lease term we are required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of our properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to reflect on an annual basis with respect to those properties based on various factors  including industry standards  historical experience and the condition of the asset at the time of acquisition 
these assessments have a direct impact on our net income 
if we were to determine that a longer expected useful life was appropriate for a particular asset  it would be depreciated over more years  and  other things being equal  result in less annual depreciation expense and higher annual net income 
our assessment of recoverability of certain other lease related costs must be made when we have a reason to believe that the tenant may not be able to perform under the terms of the lease as originally expected 
this requires us to make estimates as to the recoverability of such costs 
gains from sales of real estate properties and interests in partnerships generally are recognized using the full accrual method in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for real estate sales  provided that various criteria are met relating to the terms of sale and any subsequent involvement by us with the properties sold 
intangible assets we account for our property acquisitions under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no

pursuant to sfas no 
 the purchase price of a property is allocated to the 
back to contents property s assets based on our estimates of their fair value 
the determination of the fair value of intangible assets requires significant estimates by management and considers many factors  including our expectations about the underlying property and the general market conditions in which the property operates 
the judgment and subjectivity inherent in such assumptions can have a significant impact on the magnitude of the intangible assets that we record 
sfas no 
provides guidance on allocating a portion of the purchase price of a property to intangible assets 
our methodology for this allocation includes estimating an as if vacant fair value of the physical property  which is allocated to land  building and improvements 
the difference between the purchase price and the as if vacant fair value is allocated to intangible assets 
there are three categories of intangible assets to be considered i value of in place leases  ii above and below market value of in place leases and iii customer relationship value 
the value of in place leases is estimated based on the value associated with the costs avoided in originating leases comparable to the acquired in place leases  as well as the value associated with lost rental revenue during the assumed lease up period 
the value of in place leases is amortized as real estate amortization over the remaining lease term 
above market and below market in place lease values for acquired properties are recorded based on the present value of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in place leases and ii our estimates of fair market lease rates for the comparable in place leases  based on factors including historical experience  recently executed transactions and specific property issues  measured over a period equal to the remaining non cancelable term of the lease 
the value of above market lease values is amortized as a reduction of rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases 
the value of below market lease values is amortized as an increase to rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases  including any below market optional renewal period 
we allocate purchase price to customer relationship intangibles based on our assessment of the value of such relationships and if the customer relationships associated with the acquired property provide incremental value over the company s existing relationships 
assets held for sale and discontinued operations we generally consider assets to be held for sale when the sale transaction has been approved by the appropriate level of management and there are no known material contingencies relating to the sale such that the sale is probable within one year 
the determination to classify an asset as held for sale requires significant estimates by us about the property and the expected market for the property  which are based on factors including recent sales of comparable properties  recent expressions of interest in the property  financial metrics of the property and the condition of the property 
we must also determine if it will be possible under those market conditions to sell the property for an acceptable price within one year 
when assets are identified by management as held for sale  we discontinue depreciating the assets and estimate the sales price  net of selling costs of such assets 
if  in management s opinion  the net sales price of the assets that have been identified as held for sale is less than the net book value of the assets  the asset is written down to fair value less the cost to sell 
assets and liabilities related to assets classified as held for sale are presented separately in the consolidated balance sheet 
assuming no significant continuing involvement  a sold real estate property is considered a discontinued operation 
in addition  properties classified as held for sale are considered discontinued operations 
properties classified as discontinued operations are reclassified as such in the accompanying consolidated statement of income for each period presented 
interest expense that is specifically identifiable to the property is used in the computation of interest expense attributable to discontinued operations 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a description of the properties included in discontinued operations 
investments in partnerships are excluded from discontinued operations treatment 
asset impairment real estate investments are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the property might not be recoverable 
a property s value is considered impaired only if our estimate of the aggregate future cash flows to be generated by the property  undiscounted and without interest charges  are less than the carrying value of the property 
this estimate takes into consideration factors such as expected future operating income  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of demand  competition and other factors 
in addition  these estimates may consider a probability weighted cash flow estimation approach when alternative courses of action to recover the carrying amount of a long lived asset are under consideration or when a range of possible values is estimated 

back to contents the determination of undiscounted cash flows requires significant estimates by us  including the expected course of action at the balance sheet date that would lead to such cash flows 
subsequent changes in estimated undiscounted cash flows arising from changes in the anticipated action to be taken with respect to the property could impact the determination of whether an impairment exists and whether the effects could materially impact our net income 
to the extent impairment has occurred  the loss will be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the property over the fair value of the property 
tenant receivables we make estimates of the collectibility of our tenant receivables related to tenant rents including base rents  straight line rents  expense reimbursements and other revenue or income 
we specifically analyze accounts receivable  historical bad debts  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
in addition  with respect to tenants in bankruptcy  we make estimates of the expected recovery of pre petition and post petition claims in assessing the estimated collectibility of the related receivable 
in some cases  the time required to reach an ultimate resolution of these claims can exceed one year 
these estimates have a direct impact on our net income because a higher bad debt reserve results in less net income  other things being equal 
we maintain a reserve on our straight line rent balances 
we periodically review our straight line rent reserve policy  and we adjust our reserve percentage if we determine that there was a change in the risk associated with these amounts due to various property and industry factors 
in  we increased the reserve from to to address such changes in risks

back to contents net operating income net operating income a non gaap measure is derived from real estate revenues determined in accordance with gaap minus property operating expenses determined in accordance with gaap

we believe that net income is the most directly comparable gaap measurement to net operating income 
we believe that net operating income is helpful to management and investors as a measure of operating performance because it is an indicator of the return on property investment  and provides a method of comparing property performance over time

ffo is a commonly used measure of operating performance and profitability in the real estate industry  and we use ffo as a supplemental non gaap measure to compare our company s performance to that of our industry peers 
in addition  we use ffo as a performance measure for determining bonus amounts earned under certain of our performance based executive compensation programs 
we compute ffo in accordance with standards established by nareit  which may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition  or that interpret the current nareit definition differently than we do 
ffo does not include gains losses on sales of operating real estate assets  which are included in the determination of net income in accordance with gaap 
accordingly  ffo is not a comprehensive measure of our operating cash flows 
in addition  since ffo does not include depreciation on real estate assets  ffo may not be a useful performance measure when comparing our operating performance to that of other non real estate commercial enterprises 
we compensate for these limitations by using ffo in conjunction with other gaap financial performance measures  such as net income and net cash provided by operating activities  and other non gaap financial performance measures  such as net operating income 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and should not be considered to be an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indication of our financial performance or to be an alternative to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of our liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available for our cash needs  including our ability to make cash distributions 
we believe that net income is the most directly comparable gaap measurement to ffo 
we believe that ffo is helpful to management and investors as a measure of operating performance because it excludes various items included in net income that do not relate to or are not indicative of operating performance  such as various non recurring events that are considered extraordinary under gaap  gains on sales of operating real estate and depreciation and amortization of real estate

the following are some of the factors that could affect our cash flows and require the funding of future distributions  capital expenditures  tenant improvements or leasing commissions with sources other than operating cash flows unexpected changes in operations that could result from the integration of acquired properties  increase in tenant bankruptcies reducing revenue and operating cash flows  increase in interest expenses as a result of borrowing incurred in order to finance long term capital requirements such as property and portfolio acquisitions  increase in interest rates affecting our net cost of borrowing  increase in insurance premiums or our portion of claims  eroding market conditions in one or more of our primary geographic regions adversely affecting property operating cash flows  and disputes with tenants over common area maintenance and other charges 
we expect to meet certain long term capital requirements  such as development and redevelopment projects  property and portfolio acquisitions  expenses associated with acquisitions  scheduled debt maturities  renovations  expansions and other non recurring capital improvements  through long term secured and unsecured indebtedness and the issuance of additional equity securities 
we expect these capital expenditures to total approximately million in in general  when the credit markets are tight  we might encounter resistance from lenders when we seek financing or refinancing for properties or proposed acquisitions 
in addition  the following are some of the potential impediments to accessing additional funds under the credit facility constraining leverage covenants under the credit facility  increased interest rates affecting coverage ratios  and reduction in our consolidated earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda affecting coverage ratios

the dollar amount of shares that may be repurchased or the timing of such transactions is dependent on the prevailing price of our common shares and market conditions  among other factors

contingent liabilities in june and july  respectively  of  a former administrative employee and a former building engineer of pri pled guilty to criminal charges related to the misappropriation of funds at a property owned by independence blue cross ibc for which pri provided certain management services 
pri provided these services from january to december the former employees worked under the supervision of the director of real estate for ibc  who earlier pled guilty to criminal charges 
together with other individuals  the former pri employees and ibc s director of real estate misappropriated funds from ibc through a series of schemes 
ibc had estimated its losses at approximately million  and had alleged that pri was responsible for such losses under the terms of a management agreement 
no lawsuit was filed against pri 
we understand that ibc recovered million under fidelity policies issued by ibc s insurance carriers 
in addition  we understand that several defendants in the criminal proceedings have forfeited assets having an estimated value of approximately million  which have been or will be liquidated by the united states justice department and applied toward restitution 
the restitution and insurance recoveries resulted in a significant mitigation of ibc s losses and potential claims against pri  although pri may have been subject to subrogation claims from ibc s insurance carriers for all or a portion of the amounts paid by them to ibc 
pri had insurance to cover some or all payments to ibc  and took action to preserve its rights with respect to such insurance 
in september  the parties settled this matter 
after applying insurance recoveries from our own insurance carriers towards the settlement  we recorded an expense of million 

back to contents we are aware of certain environmental matters at some of our properties  including ground water contamination and the presence of asbestos containing materials 
we have  in the past  performed remediation of such environmental matters  and we are not aware of any significant remaining potential liability relating to these environmental matters 
we may be required in the future to perform testing relating to these matters 
although we do not expect these matters to have any significant impact on our liquidity or results of operations  we can make no assurances that the amounts that have been reserved for these matters of million will be adequate to cover future environmental costs 
we have insurance coverage for certain environmental claims up to million per occurrence and up to million in the aggregate 
litigation in april  a partnership in which we hold a interest filed a complaint in the court of chancery of the state of delaware against the delaware department of transportation and its secretary alleging failure of the department and the secretary to take actions agreed upon in a settlement agreement necessary for development of the christiana power center phase ii project 
in october  the court decided that the department did breach the terms of the settlement agreement and remitted the matter to the superior court of the state of delaware for a determination of damages 
the delaware department of transportation appealed the chancery court s decision to the delaware supreme court  which  in april  affirmed the chancery court s decision 
in may  the partnership entered into a settlement agreement with the delaware department of transportation and its secretary providing for the sale of the approximately acres on which the partnership s christiana phase ii project would have been built for million 
in july  the property was sold to the delaware department of transportation  and million was received by the partnership 
the settlement agreement also contains mutual releases of the parties from claims that were or could have been asserted in the existing lawsuit 
our share of the proceeds was million  representing a reimbursement for the approximately million of costs and expenses incurred previously in connection with the christiana phase ii project and a gain on the sale of non operating real estate of million 
competition and tenant credit risk competition in the retail real estate industry is intense 
we compete with other public and private retail real estate companies  including companies that own or manage malls  power centers  lifestyle centers  strip centers  factory outlet centers  or theme festival centers and community centers  as well as other commercial real estate developers and real estate owners 
we compete with these companies to attract customers to our properties  as well as to attract anchor and in line store tenants 
our malls and our power and strip centers face competition from similar retail centers  including more recently developed or renovated centers that are near our retail properties 
we also face competition from a variety of different retail formats  including discount or value retailers  home shopping networks  mail order operators  catalogs  telemarketers and internet retailers 
this competition could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease space and on the level of rent that we receive 
a significant amount of capital has and might continue to provide funding for the development of properties that might compete with our properties 
the development of competing retail properties and the related increase in competition for tenants might require us to make capital improvements to properties that we would have deferred or would not have otherwise planned to make 
such redevelopments  undertaken individually or collectively  involve costs and expenses that could adversely affect our results of operations 
an increase in the number of competing properties might also affect the occupancy and net operating income of our properties 
we are vulnerable to credit risk if retailers that lease space from us experience economic declines or are unable to continue operating in our retail properties due to bankruptcies or other factors 
seasonality there is seasonality in the retail real estate industry 
retail property leases often provide for the payment of a portion of rents based on a percentage of sales over certain levels 
income from such rents is recorded only after the minimum sales levels have been met 
the sales levels are often met in the fourth quarter  during the december holiday season 
also  many new and temporary leases are entered into later in the year in anticipation of the holiday season and many tenants vacate their space early in the year 
as a result  our occupancy and cash flows are generally higher in the fourth quarter and lower in the first quarter  excluding the effect of ongoing redevelopment projects 
our concentration in the retail sector increases our exposure to seasonality and is expected to continue to result in a greater percentage of our cash flows being received in the fourth quarter 

back to contents inflation inflation can have many effects on financial performance 
retail property leases often provide for the payment of rents based on a percentage of sales  which may increase with inflation 
leases may also provide for tenants to bear all or a portion of operating expenses  which may reduce the impact of such increases on us 
however  during times when inflation is greater than increases in rent as provided for in a lease  rent increases may not keep up with inflation

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market interest rates 
as of december   our consolidated debt portfolio  including the mortgage note on one held for sale property  consisted of million borrowed under our credit facility  
back to contents million in corporate notes  and  million in fixed rate mortgage notes  including million of mortgage debt premium 
mortgage notes payable  which are secured by of our consolidated properties  including one property classified as held for sale  are due in installments over various terms extending to the year  with fixed interest at rates ranging from to and a weighted average interest rate of at december  mortgage notes payable for properties classified as discontinued operations are accounted for in liabilities of assets held for sale on the consolidated balance sheets 
mortgage notes payable for properties owned by unconsolidated partnerships that are accounted for in investments in partnerships  at equity on the consolidated balance sheet 
our interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques 
the table below presents the principal amounts of the expected annual maturities and the weighted average interest rates for the principal payments in the specified periods fixed rate debt variable rate debt in thousands of dollars year ended december  principal payments weighted average interest rate principal payments weighted average interest rate and thereafter as of december   the credit facility had a term that expired in november  with an additional month extension period  provided that there is no event of default at that time 
as amended effective march   the credit facility has a term that expires in january  with an additional month extension period  provided that there is no event of default at that time 
based on the weighted average interest rate in effect as of december  the preceding table excludes scheduled maturities for properties that are classified as held for sale 
there is one held for sale property  schuylkill mall  which has a mortgage with an outstanding balance of million and an interest rate of at december   which matures in changes in market interest rates have different impacts on the fixed and variable portions of our debt portfolio 
a change in market interest rates on the fixed portion of the debt portfolio impacts the fair value  but it has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows 
a change in market interest rates on the variable portion of the debt portfolio impacts the interest incurred and cash flows  but does not impact the fair value 
the sensitivity analysis related to the fixed debt portfolio  which includes the effects of the forward starting interest rate swap agreements described above  assumes an immediate basis point change in interest rates from their actual december  levels  with all other variables held constant 
a basis point increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease in the net financial instrument position of million at december  a basis point decrease in market interest rates would result in an increase in the net financial instrument position of million at december  based on the variable rate debt included in our debt portfolio as of december   a basis point increase in interest rates would result in an additional million in interest annually 
a basis point decrease would reduce interest incurred by million annually 
to manage interest rate risk and limit overall interest cost  we may employ interest rate swaps  options  forwards  caps and floors or a combination thereof  depending on the underlying exposure 
interest rate differentials that arise under swap contracts are recognized in interest expense over the life of the contracts 
if interest rates rise  the resulting cost of funds is expected to be lower than that which would have been available if debt with matching characteristics was issued directly 
conversely  if interest rates fall  the resulting costs would be expected to be higher 
we may also employ forwards or purchased options to hedge qualifying anticipated transactions 
gains and losses are deferred and recognized in net income in the same period that the underlying transaction occurs  expires or is otherwise terminated 
see also note to our consolidated financial statements 
in may  we entered into three forward starting interest rate swap agreements that have a blended year swap rate of on an aggregate notional amount of million settling no later than october  we also entered into seven forward starting interest rate swap agreements in may that have a blended year swap rate of on an aggregate notional amount of million settling no later than december  a forward starting interest rate swap is an agreement that effectively hedges future base rates on debt for an established period of time 
we entered into these swap agreements in order to hedge the expected interest payments associated with a portion of our anticipated future issuances of long term debt 
we assessed the effectiveness of these swaps as hedges at inception and on december  and consider these swaps to be highly effective cash flow hedges under sfas no 

back to contents because the information presented above includes only those exposures that exist as of december   it does not consider those changes  exposures or positions which could arise after that date 
the information presented herein has limited predictive value 
as a result  the ultimate realized gain or loss or expense with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period  our hedging strategies at the time and interest rates
