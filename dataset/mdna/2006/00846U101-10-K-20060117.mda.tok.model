restatement of financial statements we have restated our historical consolidated financial statements for fiscal  quarterly financial data for the fourth quarter ended october   and selected financial data for fiscal the restatement 
the determination to restate these consolidated financial statements and selected financial data was made by our management in consultation with the audit finance committee on january   as a result of our identification of an error related to the accounting for income taxes 
during the october  year end close process  the company miscalculated and understated its estimate of us jurisdictional loss 
by correcting the error and revising the estimate of us loss  this resulted in the recognition of additional tax benefit associated with the loss and a corresponding additional income tax expense associated with accumulated other comprehensive income pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no

executive summary agilent is the world s premier measurement company providing core bio analytical and electronic measurement solutions to the communications  electronics  life sciences and chemical analysis industries 
agilent currently has three primary businesses bio analytical measurement  electronic measurement and semiconductor test solutions 
in august  the board of directors of agilent approved the divestiture of our semiconductor products business 
we subsequently signed an asset purchase agreement with avago technologies ltd 
f k a argos acquisition pte 
ltd 
avago providing for the sale of our semiconductor products business for approximately billion 
we have reflected the semiconductor products business as a discontinued operation for all periods presented in this annual report on form k 
in december  we completed the sale of our semiconductor products business to avago 
in addition  we plan to spin off our semiconductor test solutions business in agilent s total net revenue for the fiscal year ended was billion  flat in comparison to last year 
in our bio analytical business  fiscal year net revenue increased percent compared to fiscal year we have experienced some growth from mid size pharmaceutical companies and some growth from generic pharmaceutical companies on a worldwide basis 
in our electronic measurement business  overall demand increased in communications test solutions  with both wireless test and wireline communication test slightly above last year 
in  net revenue for our semiconductor test solutions business declined percent year over year 
agilent s total net revenue in the fiscal year ended increased percent in comparison to income from operations for the fiscal year ended was million  an increase of percent from million in the fiscal year ended and an increase of million in comparison to the fiscal year ended net income for the fiscal year ended was million  a decrease of percent compared to million for the fiscal year ended the decrease in net income was driven by a million tax charge for the fiscal year ended  associated with repatriating million of offshore earnings under the american jobs creation act ajca 
in the fiscal year ended  we reported a net loss of billion  mainly attributable to a valuation allowance charge for taxes of billion 
for the fiscal year ended october   we generated operating cash flow of million  and had a cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balance as of october  of billion 
in september  we completed a full redemption of billion of our outstanding convertible debentures with a redemption price of  per  principal amount of the debentures  plus accrued interest 
in august and november  we announced a series of actions intended to enhance our focus as the world s premier measurement company and enhance value for our shareholders 
see note  subsequent events  to our consolidated financial statements for further information 
the following significant events were initiated or occurred prior to the filing of this annual report on form k in november  we finalized the sale of our investment in lumileds to philips for million plus the repayment of million of the outstanding principal debt plus accrued interest due to us from lumileds 
in december  we sold our semiconductor products business to avago 
we received billion in proceeds  subject to further purchase price adjustments 
during the fourth quarter  our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to billion of our common stock 
to date  we have repurchased approximately million shares for billion leaving approximately billion remaining authorized under the stock repurchase program  which involved the repurchase of million shares of our common stock pursuant to an issuer self tender announced in november during the fourth quarter of  we initiated plans to reduce our infrastructure costs by more than million and infrastructure related employment by about  jobs 
looking forward  we expect our growth to increase at the same pace as the electronic measurement and bio analytical measurement markets 
we intend to further reduce our costs and expenses to meet our operating cost structure goals 
in addition  we plan to spin off our semiconductor test solutions business as soon as practical in critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable 
although these estimates are based on management s best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future  actual results may be different from the estimates 
our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve difficult  subjective or complex judgments by management 
those policies are revenue recognition  restructuring and asset impairment charges  inventory valuation  investment impairments  stock based compensation  retirement and post retirement plan assumptions  valuation of long lived assets and accounting for income taxes 
revenue recognition 
we enter into agreements to sell products hardware or software  services  and other arrangements multiple element arrangements that include combinations of products and services 
revenue from product sales  net of trade discounts and allowances  is recognized provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer 
revenue is reduced for estimated product returns  when appropriate 
for sales that include customer specified acceptance criteria  revenue is recognized after the acceptance criteria have been met 
for products that include installation  if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element  product revenue is recognized upon delivery  and recognition of installation revenue occurs when the installation is complete 
otherwise  neither the product nor the installation revenue is recognized until the installation is complete 
revenue from services is deferred and recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered and accepted by the customer 
when arrangements include multiple elements  we use objective evidence of fair value to allocate revenue to the elements and recognize revenue when the criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each element 
the amount of product revenue recognized is affected by our judgments as to whether an arrangement includes multiple elements and if so  whether vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists for those elements 
changes to the elements in an arrangement and the ability to establish vendor specific objective evidence for those elements could affect the timing of the revenue recognition 
most of these conditions are subjective and actual results could vary from the estimated outcome  requiring future adjustments to revenue 
restructuring and asset impairment charges 
the three main components of our restructuring plans are related to workforce reductions  the consolidation of excess facilities and asset impairments 
workforce reduction charges are accrued when it is determined that a liability has been incurred  which is generally after individuals have been notified of their termination dates and expected severance payments 
plans to consolidate excess facilities result in charges for lease termination fees and future commitments to pay lease charges  net of estimated future sublease income 
we recognize charges for consolidation of excess facilities when we have vacated the premises 
asset impairments primarily consist of property  plant and equipment and are based on an estimate of the amounts and timing of future cash flows related to the expected future remaining use and ultimate sale or disposal of buildings and equipment 
these estimates were derived using the guidance of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 
 staff accounting bulletin  restructuring and impairment charges sab  emerging issues task force  liability recognition for costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring eitf and lastly  sfas no 
accounting for exit or disposal activities sfas no 
which was effective for exit and disposal activities initiated after december  if the amounts and timing of cash flows from restructuring activities are significantly different from what we have estimated  the actual amount of restructuring and asset impairment charges could be materially different  either higher or lower  than those we have recorded 
inventory valuation 
we assess the valuation of our inventory on a quarterly basis and periodically write down the value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon estimates about future demand and actual usage 
such estimates are difficult to make under most economic conditions 
the excess balance determined by this analysis becomes the basis for our excess inventory charge 
our marketing department plays a key role in our excess inventory review process by providing updated sales forecasts  managing product rollovers and working with manufacturing to maximize recovery of excess inventory 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional write downs may be required 
if actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated  inventory previously written down may be sold to customers  resulting in lower cost of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period 
investment impairments 
we recognize an impairment charge when the decline in the fair value of our publicly traded equity securities and our cost method investments below their cost basis are judged to be other than temporary 
significant judgment is used to identify events or circumstances that would likely have a significant adverse effect on the future use of the investment 
we consider various factors in determining whether an impairment is other than temporary  including the severity and duration of the impairment  forecasted recovery  the financial condition and near term prospects of the investee  and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
stock based compensation 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised share based payment sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r addresses all forms of share based payment sbp awards  including shares issued under employee stock purchase plans  stock options  restricted stock and stock appreciation rights 
sfas no 
r supersedes our current accounting for sbp awards under apb no 
and requires us to recognize compensation expense for all sbp awards based on fair value 
in march  the sec released staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payment sab no 
relating to the adoption of sfas no 
r 
beginning in the first quarter of  we will adopt the provisions of sfas no 
r under the modified prospective transition method using the black scholes option pricing model 
under the new standard  our estimate of compensation expense will require a number of complex and subjective assumptions including our stock price volatility  employee exercise patterns expected life of the options  future forfeitures and related tax effects 
we will recognize sbp compensation expense for awards issued after november  on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the award 
for awards issued prior to november   we will recognize sbp compensation expense based on fasb interpretation accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or award plans an interpretation of apb opinions no 
and  which provides for accelerated expensing 
we are continuing to evaluate the impact of sfas no 
r on our results of operations and financial condition 
retirement and post retirement benefit plan assumptions 
retirement and post retirement benefit plan costs are a significant cost of doing business 
they represent obligations that will ultimately be settled sometime in the future and therefore are subject to estimation 
pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employees average expected future service to agilent based on the terms of the plans and the investment and funding decisions made by us 
to estimate the impact of these future payments and our decisions concerning funding of these obligations  we are required to make assumptions using actuarial concepts within the framework of accounting principles generally accepted in the us two critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected long term return on plan assets 
other important assumptions include the health care cost trend rate  expected future salary increases  expected future increases to benefit payments  expected retirement dates  employee turnover and retiree mortality rates 
we evaluate these assumptions at least annually 
the discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit payments at the measurement date october for us plans and september for non u 
s plans 
the discount rate for us plans was determined based on published rates for high quality corporate bonds 
the discount rate for non us plans was generally determined in a similar manner 
differences between the expected future cash flows of our plans and the maturities of the high quality corporate bonds are not expected to have a material impact on the selection of discount rates 
in recent years  decreasing interest rates  particularly outside the us  have increased our benefit obligations and our net plan costs 
these increases have been in large part offset by a declining number of plan participants as a result of our various restructuring programs 
the entire impact of declining discount rates is not recognized immediately under current accounting standards 
as of october   delayed recognition of the impact of declining discount rates was the primary factor in approximately million in unrecognized actuarial losses for non us plans 
these losses are being recognized over the expected average future service lives of plan participants ranging from to years depending on the plan 
the expected long term return on plan assets is estimated using current and expected asset allocations  as well as historical and expected returns 
our estimate of expected long term rates of return has declined in recent years 
declining rate of return assumptions generally result in increased pension expense 
this trend has been offset by the impact of company contributions to the plans and growth in plan assets resulting in increased expected returns on plan assets in through as of october   delayed recognition of better than expected investment experience was a significant factor in million of unrecognized actuarial gains for us plans 
these gains will be recognized over approximately years or the expected average future service life for us plan participants 
a one percent change in the estimated long term return on plan assets for would result in a million impact on us pension expense and a million impact on non us pension expense 
we expect reduced pension and post retirement expense in due to the sale of our semiconductor products business and further restructuring 
these events individually or in the aggregate may trigger plan curtailments or settlements under sfas no 
 employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits 
we can not currently estimate this impact 
valuation of long lived assets 
we performed our annual goodwill impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of based on our estimates of forecasted discounted cash flows and our market capitalization at that time  we concluded that our goodwill was not impaired 
we have also assessed the recoverability of our long lived assets  by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted future cash flows 
we incurred million of investment and restructuring asset impairment charges in the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill and other intangibles is highly subjective and requires significant judgment 
we estimate expected future cash flows of our various businesses  which operate in a number of markets and geographical regions 
we then determine the carrying value of these businesses 
we exercise judgment in assigning and allocating certain assets and liabilities to these businesses 
we then compare the carrying value including goodwill and other intangibles to the discounted future cash flows 
if the total of future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets  we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets 
estimates of the future cash flows associated with the assets are critical to these assessments 
changes in these estimates based on changed economic conditions or business strategies could result in material impairment charges in future periods 
we performed the required transitional impairment test upon our adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  in the first quarter of and recorded a million charge related to goodwill 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of long lived assets such as our property  plant and equipment is also highly subjective and requires significant judgment 
in order to estimate the fair value of long lived assets  we typically make various assumptions about the future prospects for the business that the asset relates to  consider market factors specific to that business and estimate future cash flows to be generated by that business 
based on these assumptions and estimates  we determine whether we need to take an impairment charge to reduce the value of the asset stated on our balance sheet to reflect its estimated fair value 
assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as the real estate market  industry and economic trends  and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts 
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate  changes in assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results 
accounting for income taxes 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part 
when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets such as net operating losses or foreign tax credit carryforwards will not be realized  a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that cannot be realized 
realization is based on our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income 
during the third quarter of  we recorded a non cash charge to establish a valuation allowance of billion  which included approximately billion of tax benefits recorded during the first six months of this left an approximately billion net tax provision recorded within provision for taxes for the valuation allowance was determined in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
which requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable 
such assessment is required on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 
cumulative losses incurred in the us and selected entities in other foreign jurisdictions in recent years represented sufficient negative evidence  which made it difficult for positive evidence to overcome under sfas no 
accordingly  a full valuation allowance was recorded in certain entities of those selected jurisdictions 
we intend to maintain a full valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support reversal of the valuation allowance 
profits or losses incurred in the us and selected entities in other jurisdictions affect the ongoing amount of the valuation allowance 
we expect that pre tax income in fiscal will be recognized at a lower rate because future income taxes in the us and entities in other jurisdictions will be offset against adjustments to the valuation allowance to effectively eliminate any tax expense or benefit in those jurisdictions 
income taxes will continue to be recorded for various jurisdictions subject to the need for valuation allowances in those jurisdictions 
we have not provided for us federal income and foreign withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries  the cumulative amount of which is approximately million as of october   because we intend to reinvest such earnings indefinitely 
should we decide to remit this income to the us in a future period  our provision for income taxes may increase materially in that period 
we are subject to ongoing tax examinations of our tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities in various jurisdictions 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
restructuring and asset impairment restructuring plans initiated in  and prior plans are substantially complete 
in  we initiated a new restructuring plan fy plan 
with the fy plan  we intend to reduce infrastructure related employment by about  jobs and reduce our annual infrastructure costs by more than million  with approximately million savings from job elimination and transfer to lower cost regions  approximately million savings from consolidations of facilities and million reduced information technology it spending 
of the  infrastructure related jobs  approximately employees have been notified as of october  and we expect another employees will be notified in the fiscal year the fy plan also extends to job reductions within our business segments of approximately people all of whom were notified as of october  these reductions will be concentrated in the semiconductor test solutions and electronic measurement businesses  with semiconductor test solutions reductions focused in the us  germany and japan  and electronic measurement reductions focused in the us and the us as of october   we have reduced our workforce by approximately  people approximately  people from prior plans and approximately people from the fy plan to approximately  employees  excluding our former semiconductor products business employees 
we recorded restructuring and asset impairment charges of million  million and million for the fiscal years ended  and  respectively 
our accrual for future restructuring expenses totaled million as of october   and it encompasses the fy plan and our remaining liability for consolidation of excess facilities from prior plans 
our plans to consolidate excess facilities resulted in charges of million in for lease termination fees and losses anticipated from sub lease agreements related to prior plans 
similar charges in and were million and million  respectively 
we will continue to make lease payments on some of this excess facility space over the next five years 
the restructuring accrual is recorded in other accrued liabilities and other long term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 
for further details on our restructuring plans  see note  restructuring and asset impairment  to our consolidated financial statements 
foreign currency our revenues  costs and expenses  and monetary assets and liabilities are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our global operating and financing activities 
we hedge net cash flow and balance sheet exposures that are not denominated in the functional currencies of our subsidiaries on a short term and anticipated basis 
we do experience some fluctuations within individual lines of the consolidated statement of operations and balance sheet as our hedging program is not designed to offset the currency movements in each category of revenues  expenses  monetary assets and liabilities 
however  movements in exchange rates net of our hedging activities had no material effect on our net income loss in the periods presented 
indemnifications indemnifications to hewlett packard we have given multiple indemnities to hewlett packard hp in connection with our activities prior to our spin off from hp for the businesses that constituted agilent prior to the spin off 
these indemnifications cover a variety of aspects of our business  including  but not limited to  employee  tax  intellectual property and environmental matters 
the agreements containing these indemnifications have been previously disclosed as exhibits to our registration statement on form s filed on august  in our opinion  the fair value of these indemnifications is not material 
indemnifications to officers and directors our corporate by laws require that we indemnify our officers and directors  as well as those who act as directors and officers of other entities at our request  against expenses  judgments  fines  settlements and other amounts actually and reasonably incurred in connection with any proceedings arising out of their services to agilent 
in addition  we have entered into separate indemnification agreements with each director and each board appointed officer of agilent which provide for indemnification of these directors and officers under similar circumstances and under additional circumstances 
the indemnification obligations are more fully described in the by laws and the indemnification agreements 
we purchase insurance to cover claims or a portion of the claims made against our directors and officers 
since a maximum obligation is not explicitly stated in our by laws or in our indemnification agreements and will depend on the facts and circumstances that arise out of any future claims  the overall maximum amount of the obligations cannot be reasonably estimated 
historically  we have not made payments related to these obligations  and the fair value for these obligations is zero on the consolidated balance sheet as of october  indemnifications to avago in connection with the sale of our semiconductor products business in december  we agreed to indemnify avago  its affiliates and other related parties for certain liabilities that were excluded from the sale such as pre closing taxes and other specified items 
other indemnifications as is customary in our industry and as provided for in local law in the us and other jurisdictions  many of our standard contracts provide remedies to our customers and others with whom we enter into contracts  such as defense  settlement  or payment of judgment for intellectual property claims related to the use of our products 
from time to time  we indemnify customers  as well as our suppliers  contractors  lessors  lessees  companies that purchase our businesses or assets and others with whom we enter into contracts  against combinations of loss  expense  or liability arising from various triggering events related to the sale and the use of our products and services  the use of their goods and services  the use of facilities and state of our owned facilities  the state of the assets and businesses that we sell and other matters covered by such contracts  usually up to a specified maximum amount 
in addition  from time to time we also provide protection to these parties against claims related to undiscovered liabilities  additional product liability or environmental obligations 
in our experience  claims made under such indemnifications are rare and the associated estimated fair value of the liability is not material 
results from continuing operations for the fiscal year ended  income from continuing operations was million  an increase of million from million in and almost a billon improvement from the  million loss incurred in the increase of million in was primarily due to tighter cost controls 
the increase in income from to of approximately  million was primarily due to approximately a billion tax charge in relating to the establishment of a valuation allowance in the us and the uk also contributing to s improved performance over was growth in revenue of million  improvement in gross margin of percentage points  and a decline in operating expenses of million year over year 
agilent saw a percentage point improvement in its operating margin in compared to  despite a revenue decrease of million 
this was due to controls over our operating expenses  the continued move of manufacturing capacity to lower cost regions  and restructuring savings 
orders and net revenue years ended october  over change over change in millions orders    net revenue products    services and other total net revenue    years ended october  over ppts change over ppts change of total net revenue products services and other total orders in were up by percent year over year  with nearly all our businesses achieving order growth 
we experienced good growth in wireline communications test and solid demand in our bio analytical business 
orders in were up by percent compared to  with all businesses growing except semiconductor test solutions  which saw a percent decrease over the prior year  primarily caused by our customers excess capacity and excess inventory that had built up over the second half 
net revenue in was flat compared to growth in the bio analytical and electronic measurement businesses was offset by a cyclical softness that affected our semiconductor test solutions business in the first half of net revenue in increased by percent over all of our businesses experienced an increase in revenue in services and other includes revenue generated from servicing our installed base of products  warranty extensions and consulting 
in and  services and other revenue increased over the prior year as our installed base of products increased and a change in standard warranty from three years to one year drove a higher volume of extended warranty business

total gross margin increased percentage points from to this improvement was the result of restructuring activities  material cost reductions and overall operational improvements  including mix improvements 
total gross margin increased percentage points from to gross margin on both product and service increased percentage points in compared to this is a reflection of our continued work on lowering our cost structure 
we expect to continue to experience the benefits of a more variable cost structure through use of contract manufacturers 
in addition  we will continue to reduce our own manufacturing costs by shifting production to lower cost regions 
in  gross margin on services and other increased percentage points  and gross margin on products increased percentage points over  as a reflection of lower cost structure  principally through our restructuring programs 
operating margin increased percentage point in compared to  slightly lagging the improvement achieved in gross margin  due to increased research and development expense 
in operating margin increased percentage points compared to this was primarily due to savings from our restructuring efforts and a million decrease in restructuring costs for research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses in compared to our research and development efforts focus on potential new products and product improvements covering a wide variety of technologies in communications  electronics and bio analytical measurement  none of which is individually significant to our operations 
this research and development is aimed at improving the more than  products already in production and on new product releases 
because of the large number of new and existing products and research and development projects across all of our businesses and at agilent laboratories  it is difficult to quantify the impact of any specific products or projects 
we are committed to bringing new products to the market and have focused our development efforts on key strategic opportunities in order to align our business with available markets and position ourselves to capture market share 
income from operations in was million  an increase of approximately million compared to the increase was primarily driven by a million decrease in costs and expenses due to the incremental benefits of our restructuring programs and discretionary spending controls 
income from operations in was million  an increase of approximately million from the increase was primarily due to a revenue increase of million  combined with a million reduction in restructuring charges in compared to at october   our headcount  on a continuing operations basis  was approximately  compared to  in and  in other income expense  net years ended october  over change over change in millions interest income interest expense other income expense  net total other income expense  net as discussed in note  summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements  in  we reclassified our equity earnings and gain in from our lumileds joint venture from other income expense  net to a new caption below the provision for income taxes

prior periods amounts have also been reclassified 
other income expense  net generally includes interest income  interest expense  rental income  currency gain loss on balance sheet remeasurement and other miscellaneous items 
other income expense  net increased by million in compared to due primarily to an increase in interest income of million derived principally from the investment of our increased surplus cash balances in bank time deposits and other money market instruments and higher interest rates 
other income expense  net remained flat from to provision for income taxes from continuing operations years ended october  restated in millions provision for income taxes  we have restated our historical consolidated financial statements for fiscal  quarterly financial data for the fourth quarter ended october   and selected financial data for fiscal the restatement 
the determination to restate these consolidated financial statements and selected financial data was made by our management in consultation with the audit finance committee on january   as a result of our identification of an error related to the accounting for income taxes 
during the october  year end close process  the company miscalculated and understated its estimate of us jurisdictional loss 
by correcting the error and revising the estimate of us loss  this resulted in the recognition of additional tax benefit associated with the loss and a corresponding additional income tax expense associated with accumulated other comprehensive income pursuant to sfas no 
this error was identified through the operation of our internal control over financial reporting in the restatement decreases our provision for income taxes for fiscal by million and increases net income by million  or per diluted share 
on october   the american jobs creation act of ajca was signed into law 
the ajca creates a temporary incentive for us corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an percent dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we distributed cash from our foreign subsidiaries and will report an extraordinary dividend as defined in the ajca of million and a related tax liability of approximately million in our fiscal federal income tax return 
for fiscal  million of the million is provided for in the discontinued operations provision for income taxes  while the remaining is provided for in the continuing operations provision for income taxes 
for the year ended october   we recorded an income tax provision of million on continuing operations as compared with an income tax provision of million and  million on continuing operations for the years ended october  and  respectively 
the current year to date provision was recorded for taxes on income generated in jurisdictions other than the us and other jurisdictions for which we have a valuation allowance 
during the third quarter of  we recorded a non cash charge to establish a valuation allowance of billion which included approximately billion of tax benefits recorded during the first six months of  resulting in an approximate billion net deferred tax provision recorded within provision for taxes for the valuation allowance was determined in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
which requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable  such assessment is required on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 
cumulative losses incurred in the u 
s and entities in other jurisdictions in recent years represented sufficient negative evidence under sfas no 
to require a full valuation allowance in these jurisdictions 
we intend to maintain a full valuation allowance in these jurisdictions until sufficient positive evidence exists to support the reversal of the valuation allowance 
for  the annual effective tax rate was percent on continuing operations 
the percent continuing operations tax rate reflects taxes in jurisdictions other than the us and entities in other jurisdictions in which income tax or benefit continues to be offset by adjustments to the valuation allowance 
the tax rate for continuing operations does not include the impact of income from low tax jurisdictions generated by our semiconductor products business which is now reported within discontinued operations 
additionally  the ajca repatriation tax caused an percent increase in the effective tax rate as during we decided to repatriate earnings on which we had not previously provided for u 
s taxes 
from time to time the company undertakes certain employment  capital and other investment actions that subject the company s income to reduced tax rates 
the annual effective tax rate may change over time as the amount or mix of income and taxes changes 
our effective tax rate is calculated using our projected annual pre tax income or loss and is affected by research and development tax credits  the expected level of other tax benefits  the effects of business acquisitions and dispositions  the impact of changes to the valuation allowance  changes in other comprehensive income  as well as changes in the mix of income and losses outside the us and entities in other jurisdictions having varying statutory rates 
for  the annual effective tax rate was percent on continuing operations  and was benefited by a valuation allowance release of million 
for  the annual effective tax rate was percent on continuing operations due primarily to the charge for the valuation allowance

agilent s ownership interest in lumileds was approximately percent as of october  our equity in the net income of our unconsolidated affiliate for the three years ended october  was million  million and million 
in the second quarter of fiscal year  we sold percent of our interest in lumileds to philips for a gain of million 
agilent sold its interest in lumileds on november   see note  subsequent events  to our consolidated financial statements 
general infrastructure and shared services for agilent overall  we have decreased our infrastructure costs primarily through restructuring programs and cost controls 
we have reduced the number of employees in our workforce that provide support services such as finance  it and workplace services and moved some of our global shared services operations sites to lower cost regions 
compared to  incremental savings for infrastructure costs for associated with restructuring plans  it data center and networking costs  it project investments and cost controls were approximately million 
we passed through these savings to all our businesses according to usage of related services 
the general infrastructure and shared services functions ended with approximately  employees  a decrease of approximately employees from one year ago and a decrease of approximately employees from two years ago 
over the past two years  general infrastructure and shared services headcount has dropped approximately in the us and europe but has grown approximately in asia  primarily in india 
we expect to continue to reduce infrastructure costs  currently reported in continuing operations  as we divest our semiconductor products business and spin off our semiconductor test solutions business 
approximately general infrastructure and shared services employees will be moving to our divested semiconductor products business in segment overview agilent is the world s premier measurement company providing core bio analytical and electronic measurement solutions to the communications  electronics  life sciences and chemical analysis industries 
we have three primary businesses electronic measurement  bio analytical measurement  and semiconductor test solutions 
in addition to the discussion below  also see note  segment information  to our consolidated financial statements 
electronic measurement our electronic measurement business provides standard and customized solutions that are used in the design  development  manufacture  installation  deployment and operation of electronic equipment and systems and communications networks and services 
orders and net revenue years ended october  over change over change in millions orders    net revenue from products    net revenue from services and other total net revenue    compared to  electronic measurement experienced a percent increase in orders 
while our wireless communications test orders grew only slightly from last year  we experienced significant growth in our wireline communications test 
general purpose test orders remained flat year over year 
the percent increase in orders in compared to was related to strong aerospace defense business  growth in the communications test market for consumer electronics dvd players  lcd tvs  cell phones and expansion of the asian handset manufacturing capacity 
electronic measurement revenues were up percent year over year in communications test makes up approximately percent of the electronic measurement revenues  and wireless test makes up approximately percent of communications test 
the communication test revenues were up percent year over year  with a percent year over year increase in wireline test and a percent year over year increase in wireless test 
this was mainly due to the strength of our signal analyzers and signal generator related products  telecom service provider network integration and next generation ip services 
general purpose test revenues were flat year over year 
in segment revenues increased percent compared to  largely due to the expansion of cell phone handset production in asia 
looking forward to  we anticipate moderate revenue growth to be driven by opportunities tied to the universal adoption of g  broadband access proliferation and our recent oscilloscope market share gains

our electronic measurement business ended with approximately  employees  a decrease of approximately employees from one year ago and  employees from two years ago 
gross margin for products and services increased percentage points year over year in this improvement was driven by restructuring activities  material cost reductions and overall operational improvements  and was achieved despite a million increase in inventory charges in gross margin for products and services increased percentage points in compared to operating margin increased percentage points in compared to  with research and development expenses increasing slightly and selling  general and administrative expenses decreasing slightly due to savings from restructuring activities and discretionary spending controls 
in  operating margin increased percentage points compared to  with operational expenses decreasing by million as a result of restructuring savings and expense reduction 
income from operations income from operations increased in by million compared to on a revenue increase of million 
restructuring through workforce reductions  reduction in our cost structure and discretionary spending controls helped comparative operating results 
the million improvement in income from operations in compared to was achieved through strong revenue growth in combination with an percentage point improvement in gross margins and a million reduction in research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses 
bio analytical measurement our bio analytical measurement business provides application focused solutions that include instruments  software  consumables and services that enable customers to identify  quantify and analyze the physical and biological properties of substances and products 
our seven key product categories include microarrays  microfluidics  gas chromatography  liquid chromatography  mass spectrometry  software and informatics  and related consumables  reagents and services 
the business achieved solid growth in  with orders and revenue growing by percent and percent  respectively  compared to  and operating income up percent 
all seven key product categories contributed to the overall growth of the bio analytical measurement segment 
orders and net revenue years ended october  over change over change in millions orders    net revenue from products   net revenue from services and other total net revenue    bio analytical measurement business orders and revenue continued to grow  achieving record levels in growth was achieved in all geographies  with the highest rates achieved in asia and europe 
in both and  growth over the prior year was driven by demand for replacement instrument systems and consumables in our large installed base in the us and europe  increased us government spending for homeland security  spending related to environmental testing in asia  and increased demand from generic drug manufacturers 
looking forward to  we anticipate order and revenue to grow from levels  with strength across both our life science and chemical analysis businesses 
we anticipate growth to be driven by new products such as rapid resolution liquid chromatography  single quadrupole ms for lc detection  lcms triple quadrupole qqq  and lcms quadrupole time of flight qtof 
gross margin and operating margin the following table shows the bio analytical measurement business s margins  expenses and income from operations for versus  and versus years ended october  over change over change total gross margin ppts operating margin ppts research and development selling  general and administrative income from operations gross margin from products and services increased percentage points compared to same period last year as a result of revenue growth  improved microarray production processes and increased efficiencies in support delivery 
looking forward  we expect to continue this trend in operating margin remained flat compared to the same period last year as we invested heavily in research and development and had small headcount increases within selling  general and administrative to accommodate growth 
income from operations income from operations increased percent in compared to due to increased revenue 
operating margin remained flat in compared to  at percent 
excluding the impact of acquisitions in  operating margin increased percentage point compared to semiconductor test solutions our semiconductor test solutions business provides test solutions that are used in the manufacture of semiconductor devices 
these solutions are complemented by consulting  service and support offerings such as start up assistance  application services and system calibration and repair 
our semiconductor test solutions enable designers and manufacturers to shorten the design to production cycle  lower manufacturing cost of test  confirm the functional quality of their devices and of their manufacturing processes  and accelerate the high volume delivery of their products 
as previously announced  we plan to spin off our semiconductor test solutions business during orders and net revenue years ended october  over change over change in millions orders net revenue from products net revenue from services and other total net revenue we believe that the semiconductor test market has passed the bottom of a downturn that began in the third quarter of and continued into the first half of throughout the second half of  the semiconductor test market exhibited a recovery driven by increased demand for flash memory used in cellular phones  cameras  portable music players and other electronic devices  in addition to strong demand for non memory chips in end markets such as wireless handsets  other consumer electronics and personal computers 
this helped orders increase by percent in compared to in  orders decreased percent compared to primarily due to a weak second half caused by excess customer inventory and delayed customer purchases in anticipation of our next generation flash memory and soc test systems 
in second half of  we have seen increased sales of our new pin scale systems  introduced in late as our next generation soc test system 
this system allows customers to reduce their infrastructure costs and offers new test capabilities at higher testing speeds 
the acceptance attests to the benefits of our single platform strategy and to the ease of migration for customers 
this includes an expanding presence in very cost sensitive digital consumer applications  including many systems for mp  digital tv and dvd parts 
because of the flexibility and scalability of the pin scale platform  we are now addressing entirely new markets  from cost sensitive digital consumer applications to high speed memory test 
pin scale products comprised approximately percent of the business in  and are expected to rise in if demand in end markets continues to be strong in the upcoming year 
memory test systems  which represents approximately percent of our semiconductor test business  were driven throughout by strength in consumer products such as cell phones  cameras and mp players 
large independent device manufacturers idms drove the majority of the business for memory testing equipment as a result of the overall increase in not and nand flash memory demand  with the remainder coming from smaller independent test houses 
total net revenue in decreased percent compared to primarily due to severe weakness across our product portfolio in the first half of total net revenue in increased percent compared to due to soc test market strength  but this was partially offset by weakness in flash memory test 
services and other revenue decreased percent in compared to and increased percent in compared to it includes the sale of support for hardware and software  servicing our installed base and the sale of services such as training  application development and test consulting for new installations 
services and other revenue tends to show lower volatility than hardware revenue since services are provided over one year or more 
looking forward to fiscal year  we are optimistic about revenue growth 
gross margin and operating margin the following table shows the semiconductor test business s margins  expenses and income from operations for versus and versus years ended october  over change over change total gross margin ppts ppt operating deficit margin ppts ppts research and development selling  general and administrative loss income from operations gross margin for products and services decreased percentage points in from due to competitive pricing pressure and a million inventory charge on the v system and other legacy product lines  partially offset by sales of previously reserved inventory 
gross margin for products and services decreased percentage points in compared to because of a competitive pricing environment 
on an absolute dollar basis  the cost of products and services decreased percent in compared to due to reduced volume and increased percent in compared to due to a higher volume of sales 
our semiconductor test business continues to implement cost control programs as well as outsource production to contract manufacturers  transferring manufacturing to low cost regions and closely monitoring indirect and direct material costs 
the operating margin decreased percentage points in compared to this was mainly due to the decrease in gross margins referenced above and an increase in research and development as a percentage of revenue in preparation for the complete roll over of the ste product line in addition to higher field selling costs to help customers migrate to new products 
in  the operating margin increased percentage points compared to  with a reduction in selling  general and administrative expenses partially offset by higher research and development spending 
on an absolute dollar basis  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased percentage points in compared to and decreased percentage points in compared to the decreases reflect the implementation of initiatives to control discretionary spending 
loss income from operations throughout we saw improvements in revenue and income from operations followed by a market downturn into the first half of  with a recovery in the second half of our semiconductor test business exits the current year with strong orders and a competitive line of products 
in addition  utilization rates for our k systems finished the year at above average industry rates 
discontinued operations in august  the board of directors of agilent approved the divestiture of our semiconductor products business 
we subsequently signed an asset purchase agreement with avago providing for the sale of our semiconductor products business for approximately billion 
we have reflected the semiconductor products business as a discontinued operation for all periods presented in this annual report on form k 
on december   we completed the sale of our semiconductor products business to avago 
for further information  see note  subsequent events  to our consolidated financial statements 
in  our costs directly associated with this transaction were approximately million and are included in the discontinued operation results below 
discontinued operations results for the past three years are summarized in the table below and include the results of the camera module business  which was sold in february as discussed in the restatement explanatory note  we have restated our results of operations to correct for an error in the provision for income taxes 
this restatement also affected our net results of discontinued operations and is discussed in note a  restatement of consolidated financial statements  to our consolidated financial statements 
years ended october  restated in millions net revenue    costs and expenses    income loss from discontinued operations other income  net income loss from discontinued operations before taxes provision for taxes income loss from discontinued operations financial condition liquidity and capital resources our financial position remained strong at october   with cash and cash equivalents of  million as compared to  million at october  net cash provided by operating activities we generated cash from continuing operations of million in compared to million in we spent million on restructuring activities in  primarily in the form of severance payments  compared to million in in  accounts receivable generated cash of million versus cash generated of million in days sales outstanding as of october  was days as compared to days as of october  while revenue remained flat  the decline in days sales outstanding reflects the continuing improvement in receivables management 
in  accounts payable generated cash of million versus cash generated of million in inventory generated cash of million in compared to million used in inventory days on hand also improved as of the end of at days compared to days as of the end of in  we contributed million to fund our us defined benefit plan  compared to million in in  we contributed million to fund our international defined benefits plans  compared to million in in  total pension plan contributions were million  or percent less than in in  we expect funding requirements for our various benefit plans to decrease slightly to a total of approximately million 
our annual contributions are highly dependent on the relative performance of our assets versus our projected liabilities  among other factors 
as the value of our assets increases relative to our future projected obligations we will make smaller contributions to maintain our funded status 
in  we recorded an additional minimum pension liability for million as several of our non us defined benefit retirement plans had accumulated benefit obligations in excess of the fair value of plan assets 
the establishment of the additional minimum liability also resulted in a net long term deferred tax asset for million of which million was offset by a valuation allowance 
in  as in  we recorded no goodwill amortization in accordance with sfas no 
depreciation and amortization decreased from million in to million in reflecting the reduced acquisitions of property plant and equipment over the past few years and the full amortization of other intangibles relating to business combinations completed in earlier years such as the objective systems integration acquisition in we paid income taxes amounting to million in  as compared to million in net cash provided by operating activities from discontinued operations  which is not included above  was million in as compared to million in net cash used in investing activities net cash used in investing activities of continuing operations for was million compared to million in investments in property  plant and equipment increased by million to million in compared to we also used million for acquisitions of related businesses as compared to million in cash provided by divestitures was million in net cash used in investing activities of discontinued operations was million in as compared to cash used of million in net cash used in financing activities net cash used in financing activities of continuing operations in was million compared to cash generation of million in we completed the optional redemption of all the percent senior convertible debentures due in the fourth quarter of the aggregate outstanding principal amount was approximately billion 
in lieu of cash redemption  holders of approximately million aggregate principal amount of the debentures elected to convert their holdings into approximately million shares of agilent common stock 
the remaining million of outstanding debentures were retired for cash  and as a result agilent no longer has any of the debentures outstanding 
loss on redemption of convertible debt amounted to million 
during the fourth quarter of  our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to billion of our common stock 
under the program  during the fourth quarter of  we repurchased million shares for million 
repurchased shares and related costs have been accounted for as treasury shares using the cost method 
also  subsequent to our fiscal year end  we initiated a self tender offer for an additional million of our shares under the repurchase program with the right to repurchase up to an additional percent of our outstanding shares as of october  subsequent to year end  in december  the tender offer expired and we agreed to accept for payment million shares at a purchase price of per share for an aggregate amount of approximately billion 
to date we have repurchased approximately million shares for billion which leaves approximately billion remaining authorized under our stock repurchase program 
the remaining repurchases may be affected in a number of ways  including open market purchases  block trades  additional self tender offers  accelerated share repurchase transactions and other means 
the program is expected to be completed by the end of fiscal year we funded the billion in total repurchases under our authorized stock repurchase program with cash on hand and from the proceeds of the sale of our semiconductor products business and our lumileds joint venture 
we also drew down million on a billion senior secured term borrowing facility 
we entered into the facility in december and it matures no later than april the term facility allows us to borrow at an interest rate equal to one month libor plus basis points per annum  or for shorter libor periods if we and the lenders so agree 
prior to its final maturity  we expect to replace the term facility with permanent financing 
as a condition of the term facility  we will segregate investments equal to percent of the principal borrowed as restricted assets on our balance sheet 
we plan to use the remainder of the term facility proceeds  as well as any additional proceeds from the permanent financing expected in the second quarter of  to fund the remaining billion of repurchases under our authorized stock repurchase program 
we believe that the cash that we expect to be generated by our operating activities  together with our existing cash and short term investments  will be sufficient to support our operations  including our working capital  capital expenditure and investment needs  for the coming year 
additionally  we believe this cash together with our current and future borrowing capabilities are sufficient to fund the anticipated repurchase of the remaining shares under the stock repurchase program 
in december  we completed the divestiture of our semiconductor products business to avago for approximately billion in proceeds 
the divestiture includes approximately  regular employees and operations in asia  the us and europe 
in november  we also completed the sale of our stake in lumileds lighting international bv lumileds to royal philips electronics for approximately million  plus repayment of approximately million of outstanding principal debt and accrued interest from lumileds 
other we have contractual commitments for non cancelable operating leases 
see note  commitments  to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our non cancelable operating leases 
our liquidity is affected by many factors  some of which are based on normal ongoing operations of our business and some of which arise from fluctuations related to global economics and markets 
our cash balances are generated and held in many locations throughout the world 
local government regulations may restrict our ability to move cash balances to meet cash needs under certain circumstances 
we do not currently expect such regulations and restrictions to impact our ability to pay vendors and conduct operations throughout our global organization 
on april   standard poor s rating services s p raised its corporate credit and senior unsecured debt ratings of agilent to bb from bb  revising their rating outlook to stable from positive 
on august   s p raised its rating outlook on agilent to positive  but left the company s corporate credit and senior unsecured debt ratings unchanged 
on november   moody s investors service moody s affirmed their credit ratings of agilent  leaving unchanged the senior implied debt rating of ba and the speculative grade liquidity rating of sgl 
moody s stable rating outlook for the company was also left unchanged 
contractual commitments our cash flows from operations are dependent on a number of factors  including fluctuations in our operating results  accounts receivable collections  inventory management  and the timing of tax and other payments 
as a result  the impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with such factors 
the following table summarizes our total contractual obligations at october   including those related to discontinued operations and excludes amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheet in millions less than one year one to three years three to five years more than five years operating leases commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers other purchase commitments retirement plans total operating leases 
commitments under operating leases relate primarily to leasehold property 
commitments under leases relating to discontinued operations totaled million  split as follows million due within one year  million due in one to three years  million due in three to five years and million due in five years or more 
commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers 
we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products 
during the normal course of business  we issue purchase orders with estimates of our requirements several months ahead of the delivery dates 
however  our agreements with these suppliers usually allow us the option to cancel  reschedule  and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed 
typically purchase orders outstanding with delivery dates within days are non cancelable 
therefore  only approximately percent of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm  non cancelable  and unconditional commitments 
we expect to fulfill all purchase commitments for inventory within one year 
commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers relating to our discontinued operations were million  and of these approximately percent were firm  non cancelable  and unconditional commitments 
in addition to the above  we record a liability for firm  non cancelable  and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with our policy relating to excess inventory 
as of october   the liability for our firm  non cancelable  and unconditional purchase commitments was million  compared with million as of october  these amounts are included in other accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
other purchase commitments 
these relate primarily to contracts with professional services suppliers 
purchase commitments are typically cancelable within a day period without significant penalties 
retirement plans 
retirement plan funding includes the expected tax deductible contribution planned for funding projections beyond the current year are not practical to estimate due to the rules affecting tax deductible contributions and the impact from asset performance and interest rates 
we had no material off balance sheet arrangements as of october  or october  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our sales commitments  anticipated sales  and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries 
we hedge future cash flows denominated in currencies other than the functional currency using sales forecasts up to twelve months in advance 
our exposure to exchange rate risks is managed on an enterprise wide basis 
this strategy utilizes derivative financial instruments  including option and forward contracts  to hedge certain foreign currency exposures with the intent of offsetting gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures with gains and losses on the derivative contracts hedging them 
we do not currently and do not intend to utilize derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
our operations generate non functional currency cash flows such as revenues  third party vendor payments and inter company payments 
in anticipation of these foreign currency cash flows and in view of volatility of the currency market  we enter into such foreign exchange contracts as are described above to manage our currency risk 
approximately percent of our revenues in  percent of our revenues in and percent of our revenues in were generated in us dollars 
we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical percent adverse movement in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above 
as of october  and october   the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows
