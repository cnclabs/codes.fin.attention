sfas also requires that retrospective application of a change in accounting principle be limited to the direct effects of the change 
indirect effects of a change in accounting principle  such as a change in nondiscretionary profit sharing payments resulting from an accounting change  should be recognized in the period of the accounting change 
sfas also requires that a change in depreciation  amortization  or depletion method for long lived  nonfinancial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments in determining the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we regularly evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  customer arrangements  collectibility of accounts receivable  valuation of assets  and contingencies and litigation 
when making estimates  we consider our historical experience  our knowledge of economic and market factors and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies represent areas where significant judgments and estimates have been used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we derive our revenue from three sources i product revenue  which includes license fees for products sold as software or on appliances  subscription based license fees  and transaction based license fees  ii service revenue  which includes support and maintenance fees  consulting fees  and training fees  and iii intellectual property and other revenue which includes patent license agreement fees and the sale of distribution rights 
as described below  significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period based on the judgments and estimates made by our management 
we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition sop  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions sop 
we make significant judgments related to revenue recognition 
specifically  in connection with each transaction involving our products  we must evaluate whether i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred  iii our fee is fixed or determinable  and iv collectibility is probable 
we apply these criteria as discussed below 
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 
we require a written contract  signed by both the customer and us  or a purchase order from those customers that have previously negotiated a standard end user license arrangement or a volume purchase agreement with us prior to recognizing revenue on an arrangement 
delivery has occurred 
we deliver software to our customers physically or electronically 
for physical deliveries  our standard transfer terms are typically free on board  or fob  shipping point 
for electronic deliveries  delivery occurs when we provide the customer access codes or keys that allow the customer to take immediate possession of the software 
the fee is fixed or determinable 
our determination that an arrangement fee is fixed or determinable depends principally on the arrangement s payment terms 
our standard payment terms require the arrangement fee to be due within days 
where these terms apply  we regard the fee as fixed or determinable  and we recognize revenue upon delivery assuming other revenue recognition criteria are met 
if payment terms do not meet this standard  which we refer to as extended payment terms  we do not consider the fee to be fixed or determinable and generally recognize revenue when customer installments are due and payable 
collectibility is probable 
to recognize revenue  we must judge collectibility of the arrangement fees  which we do on a customer by customer basis pursuant to our credit review policy 
we typically sell to customers with whom we have a history of successful collection 
for new customers  we evaluate the 
table of contents customer s financial position and ability to pay 
if we determine that collectibility is not probable based upon our credit review process or the customer s payment history  we recognize revenue when payment is received 
we allocate revenue on software transactions referred to as an arrangement in the accounting literature involving multiple elements to each undelivered element based on their respective fair values 
the residual is allocated to the product license 
our determination of fair value of each element in multiple element arrangements is based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe 
we limit our assessment of vsoe for each element to the price charged when the same element is sold separately 
valuation of allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
a considerable amount of judgment is required when we assess the realization of receivables  including assessing the probability of collection and the current credit worthiness of each customer 
we must make estimates of the collectibility of our accounts receivable 
we specifically analyze accounts receivable  including review of historical bad debts  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends  aging of the balance and estimated collectibility percentages for different aging ranges  and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if the financial condition of certain of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  we might record a specific allowance against amounts owed to us by those customers  and thereby reduce the vale of the receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
if all collection efforts have been exhausted  we would write off the receivable against the allowance 
valuation of long lived assets and goodwill we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important  which could trigger an impairment review  include the following significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner or our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to our net book value 
we evaluate goodwill at least on an annual basis for indications of impairment based on our fair value as determined by our market capitalization in accordance with sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
if this evaluation indicates that the value of the goodwill may be impaired  we make an assessment of the impairment of the goodwill using the two step method prescribed by sfas any such impairment charge could be significant and have a material adverse effect on our reported financial statements 
we did not record any impairment charges on our goodwill during or as of december   we had goodwill of million 
accrual for anticipated operating lease losses we assess anticipated operating lease losses whenever we determine that our usage of our facility space will be impacted by business conditions including mergers and acquisitions activity and subsequently reevaluate those every time when sub lease is entered into or exited 
changing market conditions make anticipated operating lease losses not easily determinable 
during we recognized a charge of  related to 
table of contents potential losses on an operating lease in slough  united kingdom that was included in our consolidated statement of operations as merger related and other costs 
the charge was estimated to include required repairs  remaining lease liabilities  and brokerage fees  offset by estimated sublease income 
during we recognized an additional charge of  on this same lease that was included in our consolidated statement of operations as merger related and other costs due to a revised estimate of the term of expected subleases on the building 
during  we recognized a  credit related to this same lease that was included in our consolidated statement of operations as merger related and other costs due to the combined cost of the final lease settlement payments  commissions  brokerage fees  and legal fees related to the termination of this lease being less than the existing accrual for the loss on the lease 
during  we recognized a charge of  related to potential losses on an operating lease in palo alto  california that was included in our consolidated statement of operations as merger related and other costs 
the charge was estimated to include remaining lease liabilities and brokerage fees  offset by estimated sublease income 
this office space was subleased in december for the remainder of the lease term with sublease rental income less than our rent payments due to a weak office rental market in and around palo alto 
estimates related to sublease costs and income are based on assumptions regarding the period required to locate and contract with a sublessee  sublease rates  and brokerage fees 
each reporting period we review these estimates  and to the extent that our assumptions change and or actual charges are incurred  the ultimate charge for the loss on this operating lease could vary from our current estimates 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we currently do not use financial instruments to hedge operating expenses in australia  bulgaria  japan  new zealand  the netherlands  singapore  switzerland  or the united kingdom denominated in the respective local currency 
we assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures on an ongoing basis 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes  nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates 
we regularly review our hedging program and may as part of this review determine at any time to change our hedging program 
interest rate sensitivity the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we have invested in may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the fair value of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed rate equal to the then prevailing interest rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the fair value of our investment will decline 
to minimize this risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents in commercial paper and money market funds 
in general  our investments are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on these funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
as of december   none of our cash equivalents were subject to market risk
