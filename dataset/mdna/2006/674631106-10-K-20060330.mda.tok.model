item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements contained herein as item overview we are a leading manufacturer and distributor of chemical formulations serving the appearance and functional categories of the marine  automotive  recreational vehicle and home care markets 
we were founded in and have conducted operations within the aforementioned categories since then 
during  we changed our corporate name to ocean bio chem  inc the parent company from our former name  star brite corporation 
our operations were conducted as a privately owned company through march  when we completed our initial public offering of common stock 
critical accounting policies and estimates principles of consolidation our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the parent company and its wholly owned subsidiaries 
all significant inter company accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation 
revenue recognition revenue from product sales is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery to customer has occurred  the sales price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility of the related receivable is probable 
inventories inventories are primarily composed of raw materials and finished goods and are stated at the lower of cost  using the first in  first out method  or market 
prepaid advertising and promotion in any given year we introduce certain new products to our customers 
in connection therewith  we produce new promotional items to be distributed over a period of time 
we follow the policy of amortizing these costs over a one year basis 
property  plant and equipment property  plant and equipment are stated at cost 
depreciation is provided over the estimated useful lives of the related assets using the straight line method 
stock based compensation we follow the provisions of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  to record compensation costs 
opinion no 
requires that compensation cost be based on the difference  if any  between the quoted market price of the stock and the price the employee must pay to acquire the stock depending on the terms of the award 
for the years ended december   and  we have not adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
to record such compensation costs 
concentration of credit risk financial instruments that potentially subject the company to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of accounts receivable 
our five largest customers represented approximately  and of consolidated gross revenues for the years ended december   and  and and of consolidated accounts receivable at december  and  respectively 
we have had a longstanding relationship with each of these entities and have always collected open receivable balances 
however  the loss of any of these customers could have an adverse impact on our operations 
concentration of cash at various times of the year and at december   we had a concentration of cash in one bank in excess of prevailing insurance offered through the federal deposit insurance corporation at such institution 
management does not consider the excess deposits to be a significant risk 
fair value of financial instruments the carrying amount of cash approximates its fair value 
the fair value of long term debt is based on current rates at which we could borrow funds with similar remaining maturities  and the carrying amount approximates fair value 
income taxes we file consolidated federal and state income tax returns 
we have adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the only temporary differences included therein are attributable to differing methods of reflecting depreciation for financial statement and income tax purposes 
trademarks  trade names and patents the star brite trade name and trademark were purchased in for  the cost of such intangible assets was amortized on a straight line basis over an estimated useful life of years through december  effective january  and pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 we have determined that the carrying value of such intangible assets relating to its star brite brand does not require further amortization 
in addition  we own two patents that we believe are valuable in limited product lines  but not material to our success or competitiveness in general 
there are no capitalized costs of these two patents 
translation of canadian currency the accounts of our canadian subsidiary are translated in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 which requires that foreign currency assets and liabilities be translated using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
results of operations are translated using the average exchange rate prevailing throughout the period 
the effects of unrealized exchange rate fluctuations on translating foreign currency assets and liabilities into us dollars are accumulated as the translation adjustment in shareholders equity 
realized gains and losses from foreign currency transactions  if any  are included in net earnings of the period 
liquidity and capital resources the primary sources of our liquidity are our operations and short term borrowings from regions bank pursuant to a revolving line of credit aggregating million 
such line matures may   bears interest at the day libor plus basis points approximately at december  and is secured by our trade receivables  inventory and intangible assets 
we are required to maintain a minimum working capital of million and meet certain other financial covenants during the term of the agreement 
as of december   we were obligated under this arrangement in the amount of  in connection with the purchase and expansion of the alabama facility  we closed on industrial development bonds during the proceeds were utilized for both the repayment of certain advances used to purchase the alabama facility and to expand such facility for our future needs 
during july  we completed second industrial development bond financing aggregating million through the city of montgomery  alabama 
such transaction funded an approximate  square foot addition to the manufacturing facility as well as the remaining machinery and equipment additions required therein 
this project was substantially completed during in order to market the industrial development bonds at favorable rates  we obtained a substitute irrevocable letter of credit for the issue and a new irrevocable letter of credit for the issue 
under such letters of credit agreements maturing on july   we are required to maintain a stipulated level of working capital  a designated maximum debt to tangible ratio  and a required debt service coverage ratio 
such letters of credit are secured by a first priority mortgage on the underlying alabama facility and equipment 
the bonds are marketed weekly at the prevailing rates for such tax exempt instruments 
during the year ended december  such bonds carried interest ranging between and annually 
interest and principal are payable quarterly 
we believe current operations are sufficient to meet these obligations 
on april  we entered into a financing obligation with regions bank whereby they advanced us  to finance equipment acquisitions at our kinpak facility 
such obligation is due in monthly installments of principal aggregating approximately  plus interest at prevailing rates the outstanding balance and interest rate on this obligation at december  were approximately  and prime plus per annum  respectively through maturity on april  during the quarter ended december   we finalized a revolving credit facility with our president and ceo  peter g 
dornau 
in connection with his offering to loan a maximum of million to the company in order to bolster working capital  we issued warrants to mr 
dornau to purchase a maximum of million shares of our common stock 
such warrants are exercisable  shares at and  shares at 
the exercise prices were determined by the closing bid of our stock plus ten percent on each date of grant 
in addition  he has the right  at his sole discretion  to convert such debt into a maximum of million shares of our common stock at the rate of per share 
at december    was outstanding pursuant to this obligation which is due in october along with accrued interest at the rate of prime plus 
such obligation is subordinate to all borrowings from regions bank 
we are involved in making sales in the canadian market and must deal with the currency fluctuations of the canadian currency 
we do not engage in currency hedging and deal with such currency risk as a pricing issue 
during the past few years  we have introduced various new products to our customers 
at times this has required us to carry greater amounts of overall inventory and has resulted in lower inventory turnover rates 
the effects of such inventory turnover have not been material to our overall operations 
we believe that all required capital to maintain such increases can continue to be provided by operations and current financing arrangements 
many of the raw materials that we use in the manufacturing process are commodities that are subject to fluctuating prices 
we react to long term increases by passing along all or a portion of such increases to our customers 
as of december  and through the date hereof  we did not and do not have any material commitments for capital expenditures  nor do we have any other present commitment that is likely to result in our liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way 
in addition  except for our need for additional capital to finance inventory purchases  we know of no trend  additional demand  event or uncertainty that will result in  or that is reasonably likely to result in  our liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way 
our operations during the year ended december  have been adversely impacted by four significant challenges  an increasingly unstable commodity market causing increased cost for petroleum related products  the announcement by our largest customer that they have adopted a policy of reducing their inventory levels  our immediate geographic area sustaining three separate major hurricanes  and a decrease in our manufacturing efficiency resulting in higher product costs 
as a result of the foregoing  we have sustained material losses during the year ended december  management has analyzed the foregoing and has adopted a necessary  but flexible strategy to provide the required working capital to cover these losses  maintain a pricing model that more closely follows the commodity fluctuations that we are exposed to  and address those areas of our operations that can be improved 
as disclosed in our form q for the quarter ended march   our largest customer  west marine  publicly announced their adoption of a policy to reduce their overall inventory levels 
this has resulted in an approximate  decrease in sales to them for the year ended december  compared to our products have historically sold well at their retail stores and they have indicated to us that such is the case during accordingly  it appears that they are approaching their inventory goals as they relate to our products and we expect that our historical recurring sales levels to them will resume during fortunately this season s hurricanes caused only minimal direct damages to our facilities and operations  principally power outages and the related down time 
however  the devastation sustained in the geographic areas that were impacted were significant and contributed to a reduction in sales to our retail and distribution customers both in that region and nationally 
in addition  the cost of petroleum related products  major components in many of our products  which were already in an increasing cost spiral  became even more unstable 
the practical dynamics of our business do not afford us the same pricing flexibility available to our suppliers  ie a major petroleum supplier tells us the new price  however we cannot as immediately pass along the increase to our national retailers and distributors 
aside from our previously reported sales price increase to our customers  we have recently announced another sales price increase which become effective during the fourth quarter of in addition  we have alerted customers who purchase products  which are heavily dependent on this petroleum related issue  that we will be more responsive to commodity pricing and they must be receptive to short term price swings or accept our refusal to ship at previously established pricing 
corporate management has enhanced its analysis  supervision and overall involvement with our manufacturing facility 
we have identified several areas that require improvement and through increased on site management presence  major personnel changes  adoption of certain strategic enhancements to our manufacturing process  and a renewed commitment from our team in alabama to strive for improved efficiency and cost savings  we believe that we will achieve a material reduction in manufacturing cost thereby improving product margins and operating profits during results of operations years ended december  and sales and earnings varied when comparing the year ended december  to principally due to the factors enumerated below 
net sales decreased to approximately  for the year ended december  compared to approximately  for the year ended december  management attributes such decrease significantly to our largest customer adopting a policy of reducing their inventory levels  the unusually cold weather earlier in the year in various regions of our country resulting in a delay in the start of the recreational boating season  and the hurricanes experienced during the third and fourth quarters of this year 
cost of goods sold increased to of net sales for the year ended december  compared to of net sales for the year ended december  such increase is attributed to increasing raw material costs and the impact of spreading fixed overhead items to a reduced level of sales 
advertising and promotion expenses increased approximately  or for the period when compared to comparable expenses in the same time period in the previous year 
this resulted primarily from planned increases in media and co op advertising programs for the current year 
selling and administrative expenses increased by approximately  or for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  such change was primarily due to increased personnel costs and other normal recurring increases in operating expenses 
interest expense for the year ended december  increased approximately  when compared to this resulted from increasing interest rates and higher levels of borrowing under our working capital line of credit and other financing obligations 
our loss before income taxes was approximately  for the year ended december  compared to a pre tax profit of approximately  for the year ended december  our estimated benefit from income taxes amounted to approximately  for the year ended december   and reflects available tax net loss carry back provisions based on the operations of the company as well as the reversal of deferred income tax liabilities attributable to timing differences between our book and income tax methods of accounting that are anticipated to reverse during the available carryover period 
as a result of the foregoing  our net loss amounted to approximately  for the year ended december  compared to a net income of approximately  for the year ended december  years ended december  and sales and earnings varied when comparing the year ended december  to principally due to the factors enumerated below 
gross sales increased to approximately  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  management attributes this increase in sales to gains made during the third quarter of the current year as well as increased sales promotions and the related increase in revenues during the fourth quarter of cost of goods sold increased to of net sales for the year ended december  compared to of net sales in the year ended december  this change resulted from various factors  some of which negatively impacted margins and others  which mitigated these factors 
specifically  petroleum product costs are higher than those experienced in prior years and currently represent a higher portion of our manufacturing expenses 
in addition  a price increase was passed along on certain of our products during the first and second quarters of in addition  margins were favorably impacted by spreading the fixed elements of overhead over an increased revenue base 
advertising and promotion expenses increased approximately  for the period when compared to expenses in the same time period in the previous year 
this increase resulted primarily from increased co op advertising associated with increased sales to certain customers and the timing of various advertising programs in selling and administrative expenses increased by approximately  or in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  such change was primarily due to increased personnel costs and other normal recurring increases in operating expenses 
interest expense for the year ended december  increased approximately  when compared to the same twelve month period of this change was primarily due to the impact of higher interest rates and increased borrowings 
contractual obligations the following table reflects our contractual obligations for the years ended december  total thereafter long term debt obligations      capital leases    operating leases    purchase obligations other total      item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we do not engage in derivative transactions 
we become exposed to foreign currency transactions as a result of our operations in canada and we do not hedge such exposure 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the interest rate on our bonds 
the interest rates on our bonds adjusted weekly and ranged between and during the year ended december
