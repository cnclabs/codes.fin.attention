item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations when you read this section of this report  it is important that you also read the financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
this section contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those we anticipate in these forward looking statements for many reasons  including the factors described below and in risk factors 
overview dusa is a pharmaceutical company engaged primarily in the research  development and marketing of our first drug in combination with light devices to treat or detect a variety of conditions in processes known as photodynamic therapy or photodetection 
our drug  levulan r brand of aminolevulinic acid hcl  or ala  is being used with light  for use in a broad range of medical conditions 
when we use levulan r and follow it with exposure to light to treat a medical condition  it is known as levulan r photodynamic therapy  or levulan r pdt 
when we use levulan r and follow it with exposure to light to detect medical conditions it is known as levulan r photodetection  or levulan r pd 
our products  the levulan r kerastick r topical solution with pdt and the blu u r brand light source were launched in the united states  or us  in september for the treatment of actinic keratoses  or aks  of the face or scalp under a former dermatology collaboration 
aks are precancerous skin lesions caused by chronic sun exposure that can develop over time into a form of skin cancer called squamous cell carcinoma 
in addition  in september we received clearance from the united states food and drug administration  or fda  to market the blu u r without levulan r pdt for the treatment of moderate inflammatory acne vulgaris and general dermatological conditions 
we are a vertically integrated company  primarily responsible for regulatory  sales  marketing  customer service  manufacturing of our kerastick r  and other related product activities 
our objectives include increasing the sales of our products in the united states and canada  continuing our efforts of exploring partnership opportunities for levulan r pdt for dermatology in europe and or other countries outside of the united states and canada and latin america and continuing our clinical development programs for our facial photodamage and moderate to severe acne indications 
to further these objectives  we entered into a marketing and distribution agreement with stiefel laboratories  inc in january granting stiefel an exclusive right to distribute the levulan r kerastick r in mexico  central and south america 
during we signed clinical trial agreements with the national cancer institute  or nci  division of cancer prevention  or dcp  for the clinical development of levulan r pdt for the treatment of high grade dysplasia  or hgd  within barrett s esophagus  or be  and oral cavity dysplasia treatment  and are working with the nci dcp to advance the development of these programs 
in addition  we continue to support independent investigator trials to advance research in the use and applicability of levulan r pdt for other indications in dermatology  and selected internal indications 
see sections entitled business internal indications and business distribution 
we are developing levulan r pdt and pd under an exclusive worldwide license of patents and technology from parteq research and development innovations  the licensing arm of queen s university  kingston  ontario  canada 
we also own or license certain other patents relating to methods for using pharmaceutical formulations which contain our drug and related processes and improvements 
in the united states  dusa r  dusa pharmaceuticals  inc r  levulan r  kerastick r and blu u r are registered trademarks 
several of these trademarks are also registered in europe  australia  canada  and in other parts of the world 
numerous other trademark applications are pending 
see sections entitled business licenses  and patents and trademarks 
on december   we entered into a merger agreement to acquire all of the common stock of sirius laboratories  inc of vernon hills  illinois in exchange for cash and common stock of dusa worth up to  the transaction is expected to close during the first quarter of  subject to the terms and conditions in the merger agreement 
of the up to   less certain expenses will be paid in cash upon closing   was paid in shares of dusa s common stock also upon closing  and up to  in cash or common stock  as dusa determines  may be paid based on a combination of new product approvals or launches  and achievement of certain pre determined total cumulative sales milestones for sirius products 
the products acquired in this transaction  called the sirius merger  focus primarily on the treatment of acne vulgaris and acne rosacea 
the dusa shares are expected to be issued pursuant to regulation d 
the number of shares to be paid will be equal to  divided by the lesser of or the average closing price of dusa s shares on the nasdaq stock market for the twenty trading days prior to closing date 
the closing is subject to certain closing conditions as previously disclosed which if not met  would provide a party the right to terminate the merger agreement 
see section entitled business general 
if the merger agreement is terminated  a break up fee in the amount of  might be due from one party to the other 
in addition  dusa has incurred approximately  of direct acquisition related costs which will affect the statement of operations if the transaction does not close 
we cannot be certain that the merger will close 
historically  we devoted most of our resources to fund research and development efforts in order to advance the levulan r pdt pd technology platform 
more recently  we have also devoted significant resources to our sales and marketing efforts 
as a result  we have experienced significant operating losses 
during the quarter ended september   the company eliminated staff positions  representing of the workforce  to align headcount more closely with management s assessment of its resource requirements at that time 
these workforce reductions were made across all functions of the company 
as a result of these actions the company recorded a restructuring charge of approximately  as of december   the company had paid all of its obligations under the restructuring plan 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately  we expect to continue to incur operating losses until sales of our products increase substantially 
achieving our goal of becoming a profitable operating company is dependent upon greater acceptance of our therapy by the medical and consumer constituencies  and our ability to develop and or acquire new profitable products 
we operate in a highly regulated and competitive environment 
our competitors include larger fully integrated pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies 
many of the organizations competing with us have substantially greater capital resources  larger research and development staffs and facilities  greater experience in drug development and in obtaining regulatory approvals  and greater manufacturing and sales and marketing capabilities than we do 
marketing and sales activities since the october launch of our sales force have resulted in significant additional revenues as well as expenses 
kerastick r unit sales to end users were  and  for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively  consisting of  and  units sold in the us  and  and  units sold in canada  in and respectively 
a summary of quarterly kerastick r unit sales to end users during the periods ended december  and is indicated below q q q q total united states      canada      total      q q q q total united states      canada     total      the net number of blu u r units placed in doctors offices during the twelve months ended december  and was and  respectively  including and placed in canada in and  respectively 
as of december  and there were  and units in doctor s offices  consisting of  and in the us and and in canada in and respectively 
in addition  during we began a blu u marketing effort to allow prospective customers to evaluate a blu u for a short period of time prior to making a purchase decision 
blu u r commercial light sources placed in physicians offices pursuant to the company s blu u r evaluation program are classified as inventory in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the company amortizes the cost of the evaluation units during the evaluation period to cost of goods sold using an estimated useful life for the equipment of years 
we have continued our efforts to penetrate the market by expanding our sales coverage in key geographic locations 
see section entitled management s discussion and analysis results of operations  marketing and sales costs 
we are encouraged with the year over year increase in sales  as well as the positive feedback we continue to receive from physicians across the country that believe levulan pdt should become a routine part of standard dermatological practice 
we are currently exploring opportunities to develop  market  and distribute our levulan r pdt platform in europe and or other countries outside of the united states and canada following our recently completed agreement with stiefel laboratories  inc we are also continuing to seek to acquire and or license additional dermatology products that complement our current product portfolio that would provide our sales force with additional complementary products to sell in the near term 
we believe that the issues related to reimbursement have negatively impacted the economic competitiveness of our therapy with other ak therapies and have hindered its adoption in the past 
we have continued to support efforts to improve reimbursement levels to physicians 
such efforts included working with the centers for medicare and medicaid services  or cms  and the american academy of dermatology  or aad  on matters related to the pdt procedure fee and the separate drug reimbursement fee 
doctors can also bill for any applicable visit fees 
effective january   the cms average national reimbursement for the use of levulan r pdt for ak s ambulatory patient classifications code apc code was increased 
the apc code is used by many hospitals 
the cms current procedural terminology code cpt code  which is used by private physician clinics using levulan r pdt for treating aks was not increased for ie it will be unchanged from levels 
dusa had expected reimbursement under the cpt code to increase on january   however  we now believe that the increase will not be effective until january  based on information from cms and the aad 
we are aware that some physicians believe that reimbursement levels do not fully reflect the required efforts to routinely execute our therapy in their practices 
we continue to support ongoing efforts that might lead to further increases in reimbursement in the future  and intend to continue supporting efforts to seek reimbursement for our fda cleared use of the blu u r alone in the treatment of mild to moderate inflammatory acne of the face 
most major private insurers have approved coverage for our ak therapy 
we believe that due to these efforts  plus future improvements  along with our education and marketing programs  a more widespread adoption of our therapy should occur over time 
we have been encouraged by the positive response from many physicians and patients who have used our therapy  but we recognize that we have to continue to demonstrate the clinical value of our unique therapy  and the related product benefits as compared to other well established conventional therapies  in order for the medical community to accept our products on a large scale 
while our financial position is strong  we cannot predict when product sales may offset the costs associated with these efforts 
we are aware that physicians have been using levulan r with the blu u r using short incubation  and with light devices manufactured by other companies  and for uses other than our fda approved use 
while we are not permitted to market our products for so called off label uses  we believe that these activities are positively affecting the sales of our products 
we believe that some compounding pharmacies are exceeding the legal limits for their activities  including manufacturing and or selling quantities of ala in circumstances which may be inducing purchasers to infringe our intellectual property 
we believe that these activities are negatively impacting our sales growth 
therefore in december and in january  we filed lawsuits against two compounding pharmacies and several physicians 
see section entitled legal proceedings 
as of december   we had a staff of full time employees and part time employee  as compared to full time employees and part time employees at the end of  including marketing and sales  production  maintenance  customer support  and financial operations personnel  as well as those who support research and development programs for dermatology and internal indications 
during  we increased the size of our sales force to from at the end of during we eliminated positions through a restructuring action  representing of our workforce  to align headcount more closely with our assessment of our resource requirements at this time 
these workforce reductions were made across all functions of the company 
we anticipate that this reduction in staff will reduce our future operating costs by  on an annualized basis 
we may add and or replace employees during as business circumstances deem necessary 
transactions during and early  dusa entered into a number of transactions  all designed to foster future growth of its levulan r pdt and early platform 
entered into exclusive marketing  distribution and supply agreement with stiefel laboratories in january   we announced that we had entered into an exclusive marketing  distribution and supply agreement the agreement with stiefel laboratories  inc stiefel covering current and future uses of dusa s proprietary levulan r kerastick r for photodynamic therapy pdt in dermatology 
the agreement  grants stiefel an exclusive right to distribute  promote and sell the levulan r kerastick r in the western hemisphere from south of and including mexico and all other countries in the caribbean  excluding united states territories collectively  the territory 
dusa will manufacture and supply to stiefel on an exclusive basis in the territory all of stiefel s reasonable requirements for the product 
the agreement  which has an initial term of ten years  will expand the distribution of levulan r beyond the north american market for the first time into mexico  central and south america 
dusa has completed its portion of the brazilian regulatory submission for the use of levulan pdt for actinic keratoses 
effective with the signing of the agreement  stiefel will complete final integration and submission of the data to the brazilian regulatory agency with market launch expected in late or early stiefel will prepare and file the regulatory applications in other countries in the territory subject to the terms of the agreement 
the parties have certain rights to terminate the agreement prior to the end of the initial term  and stiefel has an option to extend the term for an additional ten years on mutually agreeable terms and conditions 
signed merger agreement to acquire sirius laboratories  inc 
in december   we signed a definitive merger agreement to acquire all of the common stock of sirius laboratories inc of vernon hills  illinois in exchange for cash and common stock worth up to  sirius is a privately held dermatology specialty pharmaceuticals company founded in with a primary focus on the treatment of acne vulgaris and acne rosacea 
closing of the transaction is expected in the first quarter of  subject to the terms and conditions in the merger agreement 
of the up to   less certain expenses will be paid in cash upon closing   will be paid in shares of dusa s common stock also upon closing in a private placement  and up to  in cash or common stock may be paid based on a combination of new product approvals or launches  and achievement of certain pre determined total cumulative sales milestones for sirius products 
lawsuits filed for infringement of our levulan r photodynamic therapy patents in november  we filed lawsuits against physicians in california  florida  and tennessee to prevent their continued use of versions of its levulan r brand of aminolevulinic acid hcl ala produced by compounding pharmacies  for use in dusa s patented photodynamic therapy pdt treatment for actinic keratosis  basal cell carcinoma  acne and other dermatological conditions 
additionally  some doctors were sued for misuse of dusa s trademarks and for violations of the latham act for using the levulan r brand name on their web sites and promotional materials  but performing patient treatments with ala obtained from other sources 
we also sued two compounding pharmacies 
critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies are those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods and that can significantly affect our financial position and results of operations 
our accounting policies are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we have discussed these policies and the underlying estimates used in applying these accounting policies with our audit committee 
since not all of these accounting policies require management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates  they are not all considered critical accounting policies 
we consider the following policies and estimates to be critical to our financial statements 
revenue recognition revenues on product sales are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed and final  delivery has occurred  and there is reasonable expectation of collection 
product sales made through distributors have been recorded as deferred revenue until the product is sold by our distributors to the end user 
although we make every effort to assure the reasonableness of our estimates  significant unanticipated changes in our estimates due to business  economic  or industry events could have a material impact on our results of operations 
inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value 
cost is determined using the first in  first out method 
inventories are continually reviewed for slow moving  obsolete and excess items 
inventory items identified as slow moving are evaluated to determine if an adjustment is required 
additionally  our industry is characterized by regular technological developments that could result in obsolete inventory 
although we make every effort to assure the reasonableness of our estimates  any significant unanticipated changes in demand  technological development  or significant changes to our business model could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our results of operations 
we use sales projections to estimate the appropriate level of inventory reserves  if any  that are necessary at each balance sheet date 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate 
factors considered important which could trigger an impairment review include significant changes relative to i projected future operating results  ii the use of the assets or the strategy for the overall business  iii business collaborations  and iv industry  business  or economic trends and developments 
each impairment test is based on a comparison of the undiscounted cash flow to the recorded value of the asset 
if it is determined that the carrying value of long lived or intangible assets may not be recoverable  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value on a discounted cash flow basis 
at december  and  respectively  total property  plant and equipment had a net carrying value of  and  including  at december  associated with our manufacturing facility 
as of december  and  respectively  we had intangible assets totaling  and  recorded in deferred charges and other assets relating to the unamortized balance of payments made in to a light source supplier related to an amendment to our agreement and to a licensor related to the reacquisition of our product rights in canada 
stock based compensation prior to january   we used the intrinsic value based method to account for employee stock option awards under the provisions of accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 and to provide disclosures based on the fair value method in the notes to the consolidated financial statements as permitted by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 as amended 
stock or other equity based compensation for non employees is accounted for under the fair value based method as required by sfas no 
and emerging issues task force eitf no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services and other related interpretations 
under this method  the equity based instrument is valued at either the fair value of the consideration received or the equity instrument issued on the date of grant 
the resulting compensation cost is recognized and charged to operations over the service period which  in the case of stock options  is generally the vesting period 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  a revision of sfas statement no 
the company adopted sfas r effective january   using the modified prospective application method  and beginning with the first quarter of will be required to measure all employee share based compensation awards using a fair value based method and record share based compensation expense in its financial statements if the requisite service to earn the award is provided 
the pro forma results and assumptions used in fiscal years  and were based solely on historical volatility of our common stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of our stock options 
the adoption of sfas no 
r will not affect the company s cash flow  but it will materially increase the company s net loss and basic and diluted loss per common share 
in accordance with sfas r  the company will recognize the expense attributable to stock awards that are granted or vest in periods ending subsequent to december  for  total stock based compensation expense is estimated to be in the range of  to  in order to develop the fiscal stock based compensation expense estimate  we utilized assumptions including  among other items  projected option grants  volatility measures using a combination of historical and current and historical implied volatility  and expected life estimates for officer and non officer employee groups 
the amount of the grants  if any  have not yet been determined and could result in a change to the amounts included in the range reflected above 
total unrecognized stock based compensation expense related to unvested stock options  expected to be recognized over approximately two years  amounted to  at december  net of forfeitures 
results of operations year ended december  as compared to revenues total revenues for the year ended december  were  as compared to  in and were comprised of the following increase kerastick r revenues united states    canada    total    blu u r revenues united states    canada    total    total product sales    for the year ended december   overall kerastick r unit sales to end users were  including  sold in the united states and  sold in canada by coherent amt  our canadian marketing and distribution partner 
this represents an increase from  kerastick r units sold in the year ended december   including  sold in the united states  and  sold in canada by coherent amt 
the increase in kerastick r revenues for compared with is attributable to increased sales volumes  an increase in our average unit selling price  increased levels of our direct distribution to customers and a reduction in our overall sales volume discount programs 
our average net selling price for the kerastick r increased to for from in our average net selling price for the kerastick r includes sales made directly to our end user customers  as well as sales made to our distributors  both in the united states and canada 
the increase in blu u r revenue was driven by an increase in our average selling price  which increased to  in from  in during  there were units sold versus units in the total consists of units sold in the united states and units sold in canada by coherent amt 
the total consists of sold in the united states and sold in canada 
the decrease in blu u r units sold in compared to is due primarily to the implementation of a more focused sales strategy aimed at increasing kerastick r sales volumes in existing accounts  as well as a decrease in blu u r discounting programs 
during the fourth quarter of  we introduced a blu u r evaluation program  which  for a limited number of blu u r units  allows customers to take delivery of a unit for a period of up to months for private practitioners and up to one year for hospital clinics  before a purchase decision is required 
at december   there were units in the field pursuant to this evaluation program 
the units are classified as inventory in the financial statements and are being amortized during the evaluation period to cost of goods sold using an estimated life for the equipment of years 
revenues pursuant to the evaluation program were not significant in the increase of both kerastick r and blu u r revenues during is a result of the increased efforts of our sales force and related marketing and sales activities 
with respect to united states sales  we increased our average selling prices  increased our direct selling and distribution efforts  while still maintaining the services of one external distributor  and reduced our overall sales volume discount programs  all of which have had a positive impact on our average selling prices during sales must increase significantly from these levels in order for us to become profitable 
we remain confident that we are in a good position to exploit our therapy and that sales will continue to increase through increased consumption of the kerastick r by our existing customers as well as the addition of new customers 
cost of product sales and royalties cost of product sales and royalties for the year ended december  were  as compared to  in the components of cost of product sales and royalties for the years ended december  and  including direct and indirect costs to support our product are provided below increase kerastick r cost of product revenues and royalties decrease direct kerastick product costs    other kerastick r product costs including internal costs assigned to support products    royalty and supply fees    total kerastick r cost of product revenues and royalties    increase blu u r cost of product revenues decrease direct blu u r product costs   other blu u r product costs including internal costs assigned to support products  as well as costs incurred to ship  install and service the blu u r in physicians offices    total blu u r cost of product revenues    total cost of product revenues and royalties    royalty and supply fees are paid to our licensor  parteq research and development innovations  the licensing arm of queen s university  kingston  ontario  and starting in  amortization of an upfront fee and a royalty are paid to draxis  dusa s former parent  on sales of the levulan r kerastick r in canada 
although there were direct blu u r product revenues in  there were no related direct blu u r product costs as these units had a zero book value due to inventory impairment charges recorded during margins total product margins for the year ended december   were  as compared to  for the year ended december   as shown below increase decrease kerastick r    blu u r    total margin    kerastick r margins for the year ended december   were compared to for the year ended december  the decrease in the kerastick r margin percentage for the year ended december  is due primarily to an increase in unabsorbed manufacturing expenses incurred in in general  we have been operating our kerastick r manufacturing plant well below capacity  resulting in underutilization charges  which have negatively impacted margins 
due to this situation  we are realizing fluctuations in our margins as a result of both the timing of production and unabsorbed expenses 
this has been somewhat offset by an increase in the overall selling price per unit 
our long term goal is to achieve higher margins on kerastick r sales  which is significantly dependent on increased volume 
blu u r margins for the year ended december   were compared with for the year ended december  the erosion on margin is directly attributable to the fact that in we sold newly purchased units with an associated production cost  whereas during period  we sold units which had a zero net book value due to inventory impairment charges recorded during following termination of an agreement with a marketing partner 
the margin erosion is somewhat offset by an increase in the overall selling price per unit and a decrease in other blu u r product costs 
our short term strategy is to break even on device sales in an effort to drive kerastick r sales volumes 
however  our longer term goal is to move towards a reasonable profit margin on all device sales 
research and development costs research and development costs for the year ended december  and were  as compared to  in contributing to the decrease in spending in compared with is the receipt of a refund from the fda for our and product and registration fees in the amount of approximately  increase decrease research development costs incurred    refund of fda product and registration fees   total research and development expense    during the fourth quarter of  we initiated a dusa sponsored phase ii study which we recently completed 
this patient  investigator blinded study was designed to examine various safety and efficacy parameters as a function of varying levulan vehicle incubation times  namely  and minutes 
patients were randomized within each incubation group so that subjects received levulan blu u and six received blu u alone 
there were no formal placebo arms in this study 
up to four pdt treatments were given at week intervals 
the primary efficacy parameters were the percent change in total acne lesion count for inflammatory  non inflammatory  and total lesions at and weeks after the final pdt session 
acne severity scores grades were also assessed 
safety and tolerability were also followed throughout the study 
the results of the study indicate that both levulan blu u and blu u alone appear to effectively reduce the number of both inflammatory and non inflammatory acne lesions 
given the higher than anticipated blu u alone response rate using this protocol  the study was not powered sized to discern differences between these arms 
using an intent to treat analysis  at the week time point  the median percent decrease in total lesion count  inflammatory plus non inflammatory for levulan blu u and bu u alone was and  respectively 
in the overall acne severity assessment at the week time point  the levulan blu u group showed of subjects had at least grades of improvement in their acne  compared with in the blu u alone group 
in the group of patients with the most severe grade acne  which included those with the highest number of inflammatory lesions at baseline or lesions  the total lesion count at week decreased in the levulan blu u group  whereas total lesion count at week increased in the blu u alone group 
treatment was well tolerated in both arms of the study with no unanticipated adverse events being reported 
side effects were minimal 
in the minute levulan blu u group  no pdt treatments were discontinued due to pain  and at the week time point  there were no significant differences between the groups in erythema  edema or hyperpigmentation 
the results of this study suggest that for future development of the acne indication for levulan pdt  those patients with the most severe form s of acne should receive the greatest benefit 
in february  we reported the interim analysis results from our patient  multi center phase ii split face clinical study of pdt in the treatment of photodamaged skin using the levulan r aminolevulinic acid hcl  ala kerastick r in combination with either the company s blu u r  an intense pulsed light  or ipl  or a long pulsed dye laser  or lpdl  each patient served as his or her own control  using a split face design 
following skin cleansing with an acetone solution  and approximately minutes of drug and or vehicle incubation  light treatment with a fixed dose was given using one of the three light sources 
up to treatments were given  weeks apart 
interim results were assessed at weeks and the protocol includes additional follow up visits scheduled for weeks and the goal of the study was to guide selection of light source s for future development in the treatment of photodamaged skin  using the company s proprietary levulan pdt technology 
the study was not designed to detect differences between the light sources 
at week  levulan pdt with blu u light demonstrated material improvement in photodamaged skin  in comparison to blu u and vehicle 
statistical significance in net changes from baseline scores was achieved in parameters of photodamage  namely mottled pigmentation p and tactile roughness p 
in addition  the trend toward improvement in a number of parameters was notably greater at week than week  without any additional treatments with levulan  which suggests that other parameters may also reach statistical significance over time 
specifically  levulan with blu u showed greater improvements in mottled pigmentation  tactile roughness  fine wrinkling  sallowness and global photodamage score ie all the parameters that were measured except for telangiectasia small blood vessels in the skin  compared with areas treated with blu u and vehicle 
blu u by itself is not known to have any effects on photodamaged skin 
these results support the conclusions of a prior independent study by touma et al  using levulan with blu u versus blu u alone  that achieved statistical significance with the addition of levulan in all photodamage parameters measured  other than deep wrinkles 
in that study  the investigators treated more severely sun damaged patients  each with a minimum of actinic keratoses 
they also used twice the dose of blue light compared to the current study vs 
joules cm  and drug incubation times ranging from hours 
ipl by itself has previously been shown in independent studies to significantly improve photodamage  predominantly by targeting brown discoloration and red blood vessels 
therefore  as would be expected  at week  significant improvement in photodamage was seen with ipl and vehicle  especially with respect to mottled pigmentation and telangiectasia 
with the addition of levulan  there was a trend toward even greater improvement in all parameters of photodamage except for mottled pigmentation  although these trends did not achieve statistical significance 
however  similar to the blu u results  the trend toward improvement was notably greater at week than week without any additional treatments with levulan  and additional follow up is scheduled at weeks and these results support the conclusions of prior independent studies by dover et al  alster et al  and gold et al in press using levulan with ipl versus ipl alone for photodamage 
all of these studies reported significant benefits from the addition of levulan to ipl  especially in patients with significant photodamage 
in addition  although ipl itself does not treat pre cancerous cell damage  such as actinic keratoses  when combined with levulan ala to produce a pdt effect  ipl has been reported to effectively remove these lesions avram and goldman   ruiz rodrigues  
with lpdl  as would be expected  there was significant improvement in photodamaged skin with lpdl and vehicle  especially with respect to telangiectasia  the primary target of this device 
however  with lpdl  the addition of levulan for the treatment of photodamage did not lead to any discernable differences in photodamage parameters between the two groups  as suggested by the results of an earlier study smith et al  
in general  safety was excellent in all groups  but treatment using levulan with blu u was better tolerated than treatment with ipl or lpdl with or without levulan ie the frequency and severity of stinging and burning during treatment was greater with ipl and lpdl with or without levulan compared to levulan with blu u  and for blu u with vehicle 
levulan with blu u was also easy to use and less operator dependent 
during september  the fda issued a new draft guidance for the pharmaceutical industry regarding the development of new drugs for acne vulgaris treatment 
as a result of the issuance of this guidance  in combination with the results of our phase ii study  we believe that additional phase ii work will be required before we commence phase iii acne trials 
as our phase ii clinical trials proceed  and especially at such time as we may commence phase iii trials in these indications  research and development expenses are expected to increase significantly 
we have retained the services of a regulatory consultant to assist us with seeking foreign marketing approvals for our products  which could cause research and development expenses to increase 
on september   dusa signed a clinical trial agreement with the national cancer institute  division of cancer prevention  or nci dcp  for the clinical development of levulan r pdt for the treatment of high grade dysplasia within barrett s esophagus 
in addition  to further our objectives concerning treatment of internal indications using levulan r photodynamic therapy pdt  on november   we signed an additional clinical trial agreement with the nci dcp for the treatment of oral cavity dysplasia 
dusa and the nci dcp are working together to prepare overall clinical development plans for levulan r pdt in these indications  starting with phase i ii trials  and continuing through phase iii studies  if appropriate 
dusa and the nci dcp have prepared outlines of clinical studies in both indications 
the nci dcp is currently working with  dusa and investigators to finalize the clinical trial designs 
the nci dcp will use its resources to file its own investigational new drug applications with the fda 
our costs related to these studies will be limited to providing levulan r  device s and the necessary training for the investigators involved 
all other costs of these studies will be the responsibility of the nci dcp 
we will maintain full ownership of our existing intellectual property  have options on new intellectual property and  subject to successful phase ii and iii clinical trial results  intend to seek fda approvals in due course 
in preparation for new phase ii clinical trials for the treatment of high grade dysplasia associated barrett s esophagus  our small single center pilot phase ii clinical trial using our new proprietary endoscopic light delivery device is continuing 
we have entered into a series of agreements for our research projects and clinical studies 
as of december   future payments to be made pursuant to these agreements  under certain terms and conditions  total approximately  for this amount does not include any amounts which may become due to photonamic gmbh co 
kg under the terms of our license and development agreement 
see note f to the notes to the consolidated financial statements

marketing and sales costs marketing and sales costs for the year ended december  were  as compared to  for these costs consist of overhead expenses such as salaries and benefits for the marketing and sales staff  commissions  and related support expenses such as travel  and telephone  totaling  in and  in these increases were mainly attributable to the expansion of our sales force during and related marketing activities 
the remaining expenses consist of trade shows  miscellaneous marketing expenses and outside consultants totaling  in and  in for  we expect marketing and sales costs will increase from levels reflecting our increased efforts to generate higher sales volumes  as well as  a full year impact of our sales force expansion that took place during general and administrative costs general and administrative expenses for the year ended december   decreased to  as compared to  for the increase decrease is mainly attributable to lower legal expenses of  as compared to  in the comparable period in  due to the absence of patent litigation costs in australia as the final hearing in the photocure litigation described below was held in the savings related to the australian litigation is partially offset by patent litigation costs against compounding pharmacies and physicians  as described below 
additionally  general corporate expenses  including increased personnel related costs  have increased as our business has expanded 
for  we expect general and administrative costs to be relatively consistent with levels 
general and administrative costs are highly dependent on our legal expenses  which are difficult to predict 
other income  net other income for the year ended december   decreased to  as compared to  in this decrease reflects a reduction in our average investable cash balances during as we used cash to support our operating activities 
we expect other income  net will decrease in as we continue to use cash in support of our operations  our capital requirements and corporate transactions  particularly upon the expected closing of the merger with sirius laboratories  inc income taxes there is no provision for income taxes due to ongoing operating losses 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  and tax credit carryforwards of approximately  for federal reporting purposes

on march   dusa signed an exclusive marketing and distribution agreement for the kerastick r and blu u r in canada with coherent amt inc coherent  a leading canadian medical device and laser distribution company 
following receipt of regulatory approval from health canada  coherent began marketing the blu u r for moderate inflammatory acne in april  and the kerastick r for the pdt treatment of non hyperkeratotic actinic keratoses  or aks  in june dusa recognizes product sales when coherent sells the kerastick r and or the blu u r to the end user  as the price is fixed and final at that point 
kerastick r product sales through our canadian distributor for the year ended december  were  and there were blu u r units in physician s offices as of december  the increase of kerastick r and blu u r revenues in the us during is a result of the efforts of a larger sales force  and related marketing and sales activities 
in addition  the increase in blu u r placements was caused  in part  by our ability to sell the blu u r to physicians as a stand alone device for the treatment of moderate inflammatory acne vulgaris and general dermatological conditions following fda clearance in september blu u r sales during the quarter ended december  decreased as expected  compared with the prior quarter  due to a planned price increase that became effective at the beginning of the fourth quarter  and a decreased emphasis on blu u r placements by our sales force  in light of diminishing blu u r inventory levels at that time 
we ordered additional blu u r units in the fourth quarter of  and started to be re supplied during the first quarter of as we experienced a backlog until the new supply of light sources started to become available  blu u r revenues were limited during the fourth quarter of  and were limited until being re supplied during the first quarter of although the level of kerastick r sales to end users for was substantially higher than the level in the prior year  we significantly increased the size of our sales force and geographic reach during cost of product revenues and royalties cost of product revenues and royalties for the year ended december  were  as compared to  in the components of cost of product revenues and royalties for the years ended december  and  including direct and indirect costs to support our product are provided below kerastick r cost of product revenues and royalties increase decrease direct kerastick r product cost s    other kerastick product costs including internal costs assigned to support products    royalty and supply fees    total kerastick r cost of product revenues and royalties    blu u r cost of product revenues increase decrease other blu u r product costs including internal costs assigned to support products  as well as costs incurred to ship  install and service the blu u r in physicians offices    total blu u r cost of product revenues    total cost of product revenues and royalties    the decrease in product costs for primarily reflects the capitalization of labor and overhead associated with the manufacture of kerastick r units in our facility 
these costs were expensed in the prior year due to the absence of production 
although there were direct blu u r product sales in and  there were no related direct blu u r product costs as these units had a zero book value due to inventory impairment charges recorded during royalty and supply fees are paid to our licensor  parteq research and development innovations  the licensing arm of queen s university  kingston  ontario  and starting in  amortization of an upfront fee and a royalty are paid to draxis  dusa s former parent  on sales of the levulan r kerastick r in canada

blu u r margins for the year ended december   were compared with  for the year ended december  the increase in margin is directly attributable to increased blu u r revenues during with no associated direct costs  since the units being sold in both and had a zero book value due to an inventory impairment charge recorded in research and development costs research and development costs for the year ended december   were  as compared to  in this increase reflects the preparation work associated with initiating the phase ii photodamaged skin trial  protocol finalization and initiation of our phase ii acne trial  and the start of our phase ii pilot study for barrett s esophagus offset  in part  by lower third party expenditures for our fda mandated phase iv clinical study of the long term efficacy of the kerastick r 
this fda mandated phase iv study was completed in late and we incurred only limited costs to file the final report with the fda in we concentrated our dermatology development program on indications that use our approved kerastick r 
based on market research that was completed in  we moved forward with our phase ii clinical studies for use of levulan r pdt in photodamaged skin and moderate to severe acne vulgaris 
we initiated the photodamaged skin study during the second quarter of  and a phase ii study on levulan r pdt for the treatment of acne vulgaris at the end of october in addition  expenses included compensation of  for the services of consultants

as part of the sirius merger  we also expect to pay at closing certain expenses incurred by sirius related to the acquisition and sirius balance on their bank line of credit  if any 
we believe we have sufficient resources to finance the acquisition utilizing our existing resources 
on february   we consummated a private placement of  shares of our common stock at a purchase price of per share resulting in gross proceeds of  we also granted the investors the right to purchase up to an aggregate of an additional  shares of common stock at per share  which were exercised on april   resulting in additional proceeds of  offering costs incurred in connection with the placement were  of which  consisted of the placement agent s commission and non refundable retainer paid in the form of  shares of common stock calculated at the offering price 
as of december   our working capital total current assets minus total current liabilities was  as compared to  as of december  total current assets decreased  in due primarily to a decrease in marketable securities  which was used to fund our loss from operations 
total current liabilities increased  in due to an increase in accounts payable and other accrued expenses  partially offset by a decrease in deferred revenue 
during  we used  of cash to support our operating activities  purchased  of property  plant  and equipment  received  in exercises of stock options and received  of net proceeds from maturations and sales of marketable securities 
during the comparable period  we used  of cash for operating activities  purchased  of property  plant and equipment  received  n proceeds from exercises of stock options and invested  of net proceeds from maturations and sales of marketable securities 
we believe that we have sufficient capital resources to proceed with our current programs for levulan r pdt  and to fund operations and capital expenditures for approximately years 
we have invested our funds in liquid investments  so that we have ready access to these cash reserves for funding our needs on a short term and long term basis 
however  upon the closing of the sirius merger we will deplete a significant amount of our liquid assets and if product revenues do not meet our expectations  we will need to raise capital in order to continue our research and development activities as planned 
in addition to the contemplated merger with sirius laboratories  inc  we continue to seek opportunities to enhance our business by using resources to acquire by license  purchase or other arrangements  businesses  new technologies  or products  especially in dermatology related areas in the near term 
for  we are focusing primarily on increasing the sales of our approved products in the us and canada  continuing our efforts of exploring partnership opportunities for levulan r pdt for dermatology in europe and or other countries outside of the united states  canada and latin america  and continuing our clinical development programs for our facial photodamage and moderate to severe acne indications 
in january  we entered into a marketing and distribution agreement with stiefel laboratories  inc granting stiefel an exclusive right to distribute the levulan r kerastick r in mexico  central and south america 
we have also signed clinical trial agreements with the national cancer institute  or nci  division of cancer prevention  or dcp  for the clinical development of levulan r pdt for the treatment of high grade dysplasia  or hgd  within barrett s esophagus  or be  and oral cavity dysplasia treatment  and are working with the nci dcp to advance the development of these programs 
in addition  we continue to support independent investigator trials to advance research in the use and applicability of levulan r pdt for other indications in dermatology  and selected internal indications 
we and the nci dcp have prepared outlines of clinical studies in both indications 
the nci dcp is currently working with us and investigators to finalize the clinical trial designs 
the nci dcp will use its resources to file its own investigational new drug applications with the fda 
our costs related to these studies will be limited to providing levulan r  device s and the necessary training for the investigators involved 
all other costs of these studies will be the responsibility of the nci dcp 
full development and testing of the use of levulan pdt for treatment of acne and facial photodamage would require additional funding 
the timing of expenditures will be dependent on various factors  including the level of sales of our products including the success of our marketing programs for the dermatological uses of levulan r pdt  progress of our research and development programs  the results of preclinical and clinical trials  the timing of regulatory marketing approvals  competitive developments  the results of patent disputes  any new additional collaborative arrangements  if any  we may enter  and the availability of other financing 
at this time  we cannot accurately predict the level of revenues from sales of our products 
in order to maintain and continue to expand our sales and marketing endeavors  and to initiate our planned research and development programs  we may need to raise additional funds through future corporate alliances  financings  or other sources  depending upon the amount of sales we generate

recently issued accounting guidance in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter the amendments made by sfas no 
clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted materials should be recognized as current period charges and require the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we have adopted this standard beginning the first quarter of and do not believe the adoption will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position as such costs have historically been expensed as incurred 
in november  fasb issued fasb staff position fas and fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments fsp fas  which provides guidance on determining when investments in certain debt and equity securities are considered impaired  whether that impairment is other than temporary  and on measuring such impairment loss 
fsp fas also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other than temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other than temporary impairments 
fsp fas is required to be applied to reporting periods beginning after december  we are required to adopt fsp fas in the first quarter of we do not expect that the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
the unrealized losses on the company s investments in us treasury obligations  and direct obligations of us government agencies and investment grade corporate securities were caused by interest rate increases 
it is expected that these securities would not be settled at a price less than the amortized cost of the company s investment 
because the company has the ability and intent to hold these investments until a recovery of fair value  which may be maturity  the company does not consider these investments to be other than temporarily impaired at december  inflation although inflation rates have been comparatively low in recent years  inflation is expected to apply upward pressure on our operating costs 
we have included an inflation factor in our cost estimates 
however  the overall net effect of inflation on our operations is expected to be minimal 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure to any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
our investments consist of united states government securities and high grade corporate bonds 
all investments are carried at market value  which approximates cost 
as of december   the weighted average rate of return on our investments was 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by basis points from levels as of december   the fair market value of the portfolio would decline by  declines in interest rates could  over time  reduce our interest income
