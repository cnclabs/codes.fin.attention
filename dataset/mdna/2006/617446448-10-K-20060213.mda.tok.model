table of contents servicing and securitization income 
servicing and securitization income is revenue derived from consumer loans that have been sold to investors through asset securitizations 
cash flows from the interest yield and cardmember fees generated by securitized general purpose credit card loans as well as interchange fees for certain securitization transactions are used to pay investors in these loans a predetermined fixed or floating rate of return on their investment  to reimburse investors for losses of principal resulting from charged off loans and to pay the company a fee for servicing the loans servicing rights 
any excess cash flows remaining excess servicing rights are paid to the company 
the sale of general purpose credit card loans through asset securitizations  therefore  has the effect of converting portions of net credit income and fee income to servicing and securitization income 
included in servicing and securitization income are revenues from servicing rights  excess servicing rights and gains or losses on general purpose credit card asset securitizations as well as the change in the fair value of the company s retained interests in general purpose credit card asset securitizations

servicing and securitization income decreased in fiscal  reflecting lower net interest cash flows and other revenue  partially offset by a lower provision for consumer loan losses and higher merchant  cardmember and other fees 
the decrease in net interest cash flows was attributable to a lower level of average securitized general purpose credit card loans and a higher weighted average coupon rate paid to investors associated with the higher short term interest rate environment 
the interest yield was relatively unchanged from the prior year as the impact of the increase in the prime rate was offset by a decline in higher rate loans due to improved credit quality and various pricing initiatives 
the lower provision for consumer loan losses was primarily attributable to a lower rate of net principal charge offs related to the securitized general purpose credit card loan portfolio and a lower level of average securitized general purpose credit card loans  partially offset by an increase in bankruptcy charge offs

net interest income

assets  consisting primarily of consumer loans  currently earn interest revenue at both fixed rates and market indexed variable rates 
the company incurs interest expense at fixed and floating rates 
interest expense also includes the effects of any interest rate contracts entered into by the company as part of its interest rate risk management program 
this program is designed to reduce the volatility of earnings resulting from changes in interest rates by having a financing portfolio that reflects the existing repricing schedules of consumer loans as well as the company s right  with notice to cardmembers  to reprice certain fixed rate consumer loans to a new interest rate in the future 
net interest income increased in fiscal due to an increase in interest revenue  partially offset by an increase in interest expense

during fiscal  the company implemented a relief plan to assist certain cardmembers affected by hurricane katrina 
the relief plan included temporarily suspending minimum payment requirements  temporarily waiving penalty fees and charging interest on purchases for six months after the cardmember requested to be covered by the relief plan 
as of november   approximately of the company s managed general purpose credit card loans were made to cardmembers in the affected gulf coast region and were therefore subject to this relief plan

provision for consumer loan losses 
the provision for consumer loan losses is the amount necessary to establish the allowance for consumer loan losses at a level that the company believes is adequate to absorb estimated losses in its consumer loan portfolio at the balance sheet date 
the allowance for consumer loan losses is a significant estimate that represents management s estimate of probable losses inherent in the consumer loan portfolio 
the allowance for consumer loan losses is primarily applicable to the owned homogeneous consumer credit card loan portfolio that is evaluated quarterly for adequacy and is established through a charge to the provision for consumer loan losses 
in calculating the allowance for consumer loan losses  the company uses a systematic and consistently applied approach 
this process starts with a migration analysis a technique used to estimate the likelihood that a consumer loan will progress through the various stages of delinquency and ultimately charge off of delinquent and current consumer credit card accounts in order to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for consumer loan losses 
the migration analysis considers uncollectible principal  interest and fees reflected in consumer loans 
in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for consumer loan losses  management also considers factors that may impact future credit loss experience  including current economic conditions  recent trends in delinquencies and bankruptcy filings  account collection management  policy changes  account seasoning  loan volume and amounts  payment rates and forecasting uncertainties

table of contents the company s provision for consumer loan losses was million  million and  million for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the company s allowance for consumer loan losses was million at november  and million at november  the provision for consumer loan losses decreased in fiscal the decrease reflected a higher net release of reserves and lower net charge offs as compared with the prior year period due to improvement in credit quality in the company s consumer loan portfolio  partially offset by the impact of higher bankruptcy filings in advance of the new us bankruptcy legislation that became effective in october the net reduction in reserves in fiscal totaled approximately million as compared with a net reduction of approximately million in the prior year period 
the company believes that the spike in bankruptcy filings in october was  in part  an acceleration of losses that would have been incurred later in in determining the allowance for loan losses as of november   the company considered the impact of the current trends in bankruptcy filings 
the peak filing month was october  which will be recognized as charge offs in accordance with the company s accounting policy in december the allowance for loan losses has provided for these charge offs  in addition to other impacts of the change in bankruptcy legislation that were known or highly certain to the company at november  in fiscal  the provision for consumer loan losses decreased  primarily due to lower net principal charge offs resulting from an improvement in credit quality  including lower bankruptcy charge offs driven by a decline in us personal bankruptcy filings 
the decrease was also due to a lower level of average general purpose credit card loans 
the company reduced the allowance for consumer loan losses by approximately million in fiscal as compared with an increase of approximately million in fiscal due to improvement in credit quality  including lower delinquency rates and dollars 
delinquencies and charge offs 
general purpose credit card loans are considered delinquent when contractual payments become days past due 
general purpose credit card loans generally are charged off at the end of the month during which an account becomes days contractually past due  except in the case of cardmember bankruptcies  probate accounts and fraudulent transactions 
cardmember bankruptcies and probate accounts are charged off at the end of the month days following the receipt of notification of the bankruptcy or death but not later than the day contractual time frame 
fraudulent transactions are reported in consumer loans at their net realizable value upon receipt of notification of the fraud through a charge to operating expenses and are subsequently written off at the end of the month days following notification but not later than the contractual day time frame 
loan delinquencies and charge offs are affected by changes in economic conditions  account collection management and policy changes and may vary throughout the year due to seasonal consumer spending and payment behaviors 
delinquency rates in both the over and over day categories and net principal charge off rates were lower for both the owned and managed portfolios in fiscal  reflecting improvements in portfolio credit quality see managed general purpose credit card loan data herein 
the improvement in net principal charge off rates was partially offset by an increase in bankruptcy charge offs related to consumers filing for bankruptcy in advance of the new us bankruptcy legislation that became effective in october in fiscal  net principal charge off rates decreased in both the owned and managed portfolios as compared with fiscal  reflecting improvements in portfolio credit quality and a lower level of bankruptcy filings 
delinquency rates in both the over and over day categories were lower in both the owned and managed portfolios at november  as compared with november   also reflecting improvements in portfolio credit quality 
the company s future charge off rates and credit quality are subject to uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what has been discussed above

seasonal factors 
discover s activities are affected by seasonal patterns of retail purchasing 
historically  a substantial percentage of general purpose credit card loan growth occurs in the fourth calendar quarter  followed by a flattening or decline of these loans in the following calendar quarter 
merchant fees  therefore  historically have tended to increase in the first fiscal quarter  reflecting higher sales activity in the month of december 
additionally  higher cardmember rewards incentives historically have been accrued for as a reduction of merchant and cardmember fee revenues in the first fiscal quarter  reflecting seasonal growth in retail sales volume 
managed general purpose credit card loan data 
the company analyzes its financial performance on both a managed loan basis and as reported under us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap owned loan basis 
managed loan data assume that the company s securitized loan receivables have not been sold and present the results of the securitized loan receivables in the same manner as the company s owned loans 
the company operates its discover business and analyzes its financial performance on a managed basis 
accordingly  underwriting and servicing standards are comparable for both owned and securitized loans 
the company believes that managed loan information is useful to investors because it provides information regarding the quality of loan origination and credit performance of the entire managed portfolio and allows investors to understand the related credit risks inherent in owned loans and retained interests in securitizations 
in addition  investors often request information on a managed basis  which provides a more meaningful comparison with industry competitors

insurance settlement 
on september   the us experienced terrorist attacks targeted against new york city and washington  dc the attacks in new york resulted in the destruction of the world trade center complex  where approximately  of the company s employees were located  and the temporary closing of the debt and equity financial markets in the us through the implementation of its business recovery plans  the company relocated its displaced employees to other facilities 
in the first quarter of fiscal  the company settled its claim with its insurance carriers related to the events of september  the company recorded a pre tax gain of million as the insurance recovery was in excess of previously recognized costs related to the terrorist attacks primarily write offs of leasehold improvements and destroyed technology and telecommunications equipment in the world trade center complex  employee relocation and certain other employee related expenditures 
the pre tax gain  which was recorded as a reduction to non interest expenses  is included within the retail brokerage million  asset management million and institutional securities million segments 
the insurance settlement was allocated to the respective segments in accordance with the relative damages sustained by each segment 
stock based compensation 
in fiscal  the company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of fasb statement no 
 using the prospective adoption method for both deferred stock and stock options 
in fiscal  the company early adopted sfas no 
r  which revised the fair value based method of accounting for share based payment liabilities  forfeitures and modifications of stock based awards and clarified sfas no 
s guidance in several areas  including measuring fair value  classifying an award as equity or as a liability and attributing compensation cost to service periods 
sfas no 
r also amended sfas no 
 statement of cash flows  to require that excess tax benefits be reported as financing cash inflows rather than as a reduction of taxes paid  which is included within operating cash flows 
logo 
table of contents upon adoption of sfas r using the modified prospective approach  the company recognized an million gain million after tax as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first quarter of fiscal resulting from the requirement to estimate forfeitures at the date of grant instead of recognizing them as incurred 
the cumulative effect gain increased both basic and diluted earnings per share by 
in accordance with sfas r  fiscal compensation expense included the amortization of fiscal and fiscal equity based awards but did not include any amortization for fiscal year end awards 
this had the effect of reducing compensation expense in fiscal if sfas no 
r were not in effect  fiscal s compensation expense would have included three years of amortization ie  for awards granted in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal 
in addition  the fiscal year end awards  which were granted in december and which will begin to be amortized in fiscal  will be amortized over a shorter period primarily two and three years as compared with awards granted in fiscal and fiscal primarily three and four years 
the shorter amortization period will have the effect of increasing compensation expense in fiscal in addition  fiscal compensation expense will include the amortization of fiscal  fiscal and fiscal equity based awards 
for stock based awards issued prior to the adoption of sfas r  the company s accounting policy for such awards granted to retirement eligible employees was to recognize compensation cost over the service period specified in the award terms 
the company accelerates any unrecognized compensation cost if and when a retirement eligible employee leaves the company 
for stock based awards made to retirement eligible employees after the adoption of sfas r on december   the company s accounting policy is to treat such awards as fully vested on the date of grant unless other provisions of the award terms operate as substantive service conditions 
for awards granted to retirement eligible employees during fiscal  the company recognized compensation expense for such awards on the date of grant 
the company modified certain terms of the fiscal year end awards  which were granted in december as a result of such changes  the company is in the process of evaluating the accounting treatment for fiscal year end awards that were granted to retirement eligible employees 
if it is determined that the compensation expense for such awards should be recognized at the date of grant instead of over the relevant service period  incremental compensation expense of approximately million will be recognized in the first quarter of fiscal lease adjustment 
prior to the first quarter of fiscal  the company did not record the effects of scheduled rent increases and rent free periods for certain real estate leases on a straight line basis 
in addition  the company had been accounting for certain tenant improvement allowances as reductions to the related leasehold improvements instead of recording funds received as deferred rent and amortizing them as reductions to lease expense over the lease term 
in the first quarter of fiscal  the company changed its method of accounting for these rent escalation clauses  rent free periods and tenant improvement allowances to properly reflect lease expense over the lease term on a straight line basis 
the cumulative effect of this correction resulted in the company recording million of additional rent expense in the first quarter of fiscal the impact of this change was included within non interest expenses and reduced income before taxes within the institutional securities million  retail brokerage million  asset management million and discover million segments 
the impact of this correction was not material for all periods presented to the pre tax income of each of the segments or to the company 
income tax examinations 
the company is under continuous examination by the internal revenue service the irs and other tax authorities in certain countries  such as japan and the uk  and states in which the company has significant business operations  such as new york 
the tax years under examination vary by jurisdiction  for example  the current irs examination  which recently began  covers the company has filed an appeal with respect to unresolved issues relative to the irs examination of years the company believes that the settlement of the irs examination of years will not have a material negative impact on the consolidated statement of income of the company 
the company regularly assesses the likelihood of additional assessments in each of the taxing jurisdictions resulting from these and subsequent years examinations

in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company recorded an income tax benefit of million  or per diluted share  resulting from the company s repatriation of approximately billion of qualifying foreign earnings under the provisions of the american jobs creation act

asset management and account fees 
prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company was improperly recognizing certain management fees  account fees and related compensation expense paid at the beginning of the relevant contract periods  which is when such fees were billed 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company changed its method of accounting for such fees to properly recognize such fees and related expenses over the relevant contract period  generally quarterly or annually 
as a result of the change  the company s results in the fourth quarter of fiscal included an adjustment to reflect the cumulative impact of the deferral of certain management fees  account fees and related compensation expense paid to representatives 
the impact of this change reduced net revenues by million  non interest expenses by million and income before taxes by million  at both the company and the retail brokerage segment in the fourth quarter of fiscal such adjustment reduced net income by approximately million and basic and diluted earnings per share by

pension plans 
contributions 
the company made contributions of million and million to its us and us defined benefit pension plans in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
these contributions were funded with cash from operations and were recorded as a component of prepaid pension benefit cost in the company s consolidated statements of financial condition 
the company determines the amount of its pension contributions by considering the interaction of several factors 
such factors include the range of potential contributions for example  the minimum required contribution up to the maximum tax deductible amount under the employee retirement income security act of  or erisa  the level of plan assets relative to plan liabilities  expected plan liquidity needs and expected future contribution requirements 
at november   there were no minimum required erisa contributions for the company s pension plan that is qualified under section a of the internal revenue code the qualified plan 
for its non us plans  the company s policy is to fund at least the amounts sufficient to meet minimum funding requirements under applicable employee benefit and tax regulations 
liabilities for benefits payable under its unfunded supplementary plans are accrued by the company and are funded when paid to the beneficiaries 
logo 
table of contents pension expense 
in accordance with us gaap  the company recognizes pension expense before the payment of benefits to retirees occurs 
this process involves making certain estimates and assumptions  including the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
the assumed discount rate  which reflects the rates at which pension benefits could be effectively settled  is used to measure the projected and accumulated benefit obligations and to calculate the service cost and interest cost 
for fiscal  the assumed discount rate for all us plans was selected by the company  in consultation with its independent actuaries  using a pension discount yield curve based on the characteristics of the qualified plan liabilities 
the pension discount yield curve represents spot discount yields based on duration implicit in a representative broad based aa corporate bond universe of high quality fixed income investments 
it includes only bonds of reasonable issue size and excludes certain types of bonds  such as callable bonds 
as of november   the qualified plan represented of the total assets of the company s us and us pension plans combined 
the company  in consultation with its independent actuaries  set the assumed discount rates used for non us pension plans based on the nature of liabilities  local economic environments and available bond indices 
for fiscal years prior to  the assumed discount rate for all us plans was determined with reference to a standardized benchmark the annualized moody s aa long term corporate bond yield average adjusted for the difference in the duration of the bonds underlying the benchmark and the duration of the qualified plan liabilities 
a secondary validation of the discount rate was then performed using a bond model customized to reflect the characteristics of the qualified plan liabilities 
the expected long term rate of return on assets represents the company s best estimate of the long term return on plan assets and generally was estimated by computing a weighted average return of the underlying long term expected returns on the different asset classes  based on the target asset allocations 
for plans where there is no established target asset allocation  actual asset allocations were used 
the expected long term return on assets is a long term assumption that generally is expected to remain the same from one year to the next unless there is a significant change in the target asset allocation  the fees and expenses paid by the plan or market conditions 
the qualified plan s target asset allocation policy changed in august from equity fixed income to equity fixed income and  as a result  the company  in consultation with its independent investment consultants and actuaries  lowered its expected long term rate of return on its qualified plan assets from to for fiscal see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the impact of this change was not material to the company s consolidated results of operations in fiscal in september  the qualified plan s target asset allocation policy changed from equity fixed income to equity fixed income  and the duration of the fixed income portfolio was extended 
as a result of this change  the company expects to lower the expected long term rate of return on its qualified plan assets for fiscal the company s fiscal expected long term rate of return on assets for its qualified plan was based on the following target asset allocation target investment mix expected annual return domestic equity large capitalization small capitalization international equity fixed income long term government corporate these returns do not include the impact of diversification on the overall expected portfolio return 
logo 
table of contents each year the company compares its initial estimate of the expected long term rate of return on assets for the qualified plan and adjusts  if necessary with a portfolio return calculator model the portfolio model that produces a range of expected returns for the portfolio 
return assumptions used are forward looking gross returns that are not developed solely by an examination of historical returns 
the portfolio model begins with the current us treasury yield curve  recognizing that expected returns on bonds are heavily influenced by the current level of yields 
corporate bond spreads and equity risk premiums  based on current market conditions  are then added to develop the return expectations for each asset class 
expenses that are expected to be paid from the investment return are reflected 
this includes investment and transaction fees that typically are paid from plan assets  added to the cost basis or subtracted from sale proceeds  as well as administrative expenses paid from plan assets 
the company uses the expected long term rate of return on plan assets to compute the expected return on assets component of pension expense 
for the qualified plan  expected returns are computed based on a market related value of assets 
the market related value of assets is a smoothed actuarial value of assets equal to a moving average of market values in which investment income is recognized over a five year period 
the market related value of assets must be no greater than and no less than of the market value of assets 
investment income equal to the expected return on the plan s assets as calculated for the prior year s expense is recognized immediately 
any difference between the actual investment income on a market value basis and the expected return is recognized over a five year period in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions 
other assumptions  including mortality rates  long term salary growth and employee turnover rates  are set by the company in consultation with its independent actuaries 
these assumptions are tested every year by monitoring gains and losses  performing assumption studies as needed  and monitoring company objectives and actuarial trends 
these assumptions are adjusted whenever necessary 
the company generally amortizes as a component of pension expense unrecognized net gains and losses over the average future service of active participants to years depending upon the plan to the extent that the gain loss exceeds of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market related value of plan assets 
the loss amortization component for the us and the us pension plans was million for fiscal of pension expense and million for fiscal of pension expense 
new accounting developments 
limited partnerships 
in june  the fasb ratified the consensus reached in emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 determining whether a general partner  or the general partners as a group  controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights 
under the provisions of eitf issue no 
 a general partner in a limited partnership is presumed to control that limited partnership and therefore should include the limited partnership in its consolidated financial statements regardless of the amount or extent of the general partner s interest unless a majority of the limited partners can vote to dissolve or liquidate the partnership or otherwise remove the general partner without having to show cause or the limited partners have substantive participating rights that can overcome the presumption of control by the general partner 
eitf issue no 
was effective immediately for all newly formed limited partnerships and existing limited partnerships for which the partnership agreements have been modified 
for all other existing limited partnerships for which the partnership agreements have not been modified  the company is required to adopt eitf issue no 
on december  in a manner similar to a cumulative effect type adjustment or by retrospective application 
the company is currently assessing the impact on these existing limited partnerships of adopting the provisions of eitf issue no 
 however  because the company generally expects to provide limited partners in these funds with rights to remove the company as general partner or rights to terminate the partnership  the company does not expect the impact of eitf issue no 
to be material

table of contents critical accounting policies 
the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us gaap  which requires the company to make estimates and assumptions see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies see note to the consolidated financial statements  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
financial instruments used for trading and investment 
financial instruments owned and financial instruments sold  not yet purchased  which include cash and derivative products  are recorded at fair value in the consolidated statements of financial condition  and gains and losses are reflected in principal trading revenues in the consolidated statements of income 
fair value is the amount at which financial instruments could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties  other than in a forced or liquidation sale 
the fair value of the company s financial instruments owned and financial instruments sold  not yet purchased are generally based on observable market prices  observable market parameters or derived from such prices or parameters based on bid prices or parameters for financial instruments owned and ask prices or parameters for financial instruments sold  not yet purchased 
in the case of financial instruments transacted on recognized exchanges  the observable prices represent quotations for completed transactions from the exchange on which the financial instrument is principally traded 
bid prices represent the highest price a buyer is willing to pay for a financial instrument at a particular time 
ask prices represent the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for a financial instrument at a particular time 
a substantial percentage of the fair value of the company s financial instruments owned and financial instruments sold  not yet purchased is based on observable market prices  observable market parameters  or is derived from such prices or parameters 
the availability of observable market prices and pricing parameters can vary from product to product 
where available  observable market prices and pricing parameters in a product or a related product may be used to derive a price without requiring significant judgment 
in certain markets  observable market prices or market parameters are not available for all products  and fair value is determined using techniques appropriate for each particular product 
these techniques involve some degree of judgment 
the price transparency of the particular product will determine the degree of judgment involved in determining the fair value of the company s financial instruments 
price transparency is affected by a wide variety of factors  including  for example  the type of product  whether it is a new product and not yet established in the marketplace  and the characteristics particular to the transaction 
products for which actively quoted prices or pricing parameters are available or for which fair value is derived from actively quoted prices or pricing parameters will generally have a higher degree of price transparency 
by contrast  products that are thinly traded or not quoted will generally have reduced to no price transparency 
even in normally active markets  the price transparency for actively quoted instruments may be reduced for periods of time during periods of market dislocation 
alternatively  in thinly quoted markets  the participation of market makers willing to purchase and sell a product provides a source of transparency for products that otherwise are not actively quoted or during periods of market dislocation 
the company s cash products include securities issued by the us government and its agencies  other sovereign debt obligations  corporate and other debt securities  corporate equity securities  exchange traded funds and physical commodities 
the fair value of these products is based principally on observable market prices or is derived using observable market parameters 
these products generally do not entail a significant degree of judgment in determining fair value 
examples of products for which actively quoted prices or pricing parameters are available or for which fair value is derived from actively quoted prices or pricing parameters include securities issued by the us government and its agencies  exchange traded corporate equity securities  most municipal debt securities  most corporate debt securities  most high yield debt securities  physical commodities  certain tradable loan products and most mortgage backed securities 
logo 
table of contents in certain circumstances  principally involving loan products and other financial instruments held for securitization transactions  the company determines fair value from within the range of bid and ask prices such that fair value indicates the value likely to be realized in a current market transaction 
bid prices reflect the price that the company and others pay  or stand ready to pay  to originators of such assets 
ask prices represent the prices that the company and others require to sell such assets to the entities that acquire the financial instruments for purposes of completing the securitization transactions 
generally  the fair value of such acquired assets is based upon the bid price in the market for the instrument or similar instruments 
in general  the loans and similar assets are valued at bid pricing levels until structuring of the related securitization is substantially complete and such that the value likely to be realized in a current transaction is consistent with the price that a securitization entity will pay to acquire the financial instruments 
factors affecting securitized value and investor demand relating specifically to loan products include  but are not limited to  loan type  underlying property type and geographic location  loan interest rate  loan to value ratios  debt service coverage ratio  investor demand and credit enhancement levels 
in addition  some cash products exhibit little or no price transparency  and the determination of fair value requires more judgment 
examples of cash products with little or no price transparency include certain high yield debt  certain collateralized mortgage obligations  certain tradable loan products  distressed debt securities ie  securities of issuers encountering financial difficulties  including bankruptcy or insolvency and equity securities that are not publicly traded 
generally  the fair value of these types of cash products is determined using one of several valuation techniques appropriate for the product  which can include cash flow analysis  revenue or net income analysis  default recovery analysis ie  analysis of the likelihood of default and the potential for recovery and other analyses applied consistently 
the following table presents the valuation of the company s cash products included within financial instruments owned and financial instruments sold  not yet purchased by level of price transparency dollars in millions at november  at november  assets liabilities assets liabilities observable market prices  parameters or derived from observable prices or parameters reduced or no price transparency total the company s derivative products include exchange traded and otc derivatives 
exchange traded derivatives have valuation attributes similar to the cash products valued using observable market prices or market parameters described above 
otc derivatives  whose fair value is derived using pricing models  include a wide variety of instruments  such as interest rate swap and option contracts  foreign currency option contracts  credit and equity swap and option contracts  and commodity swap and option contracts 
the following table presents the fair value of the company s exchange traded and otc derivatives included within financial instruments owned and financial instruments sold  not yet purchased dollars in millions at november  at november  assets liabilities assets liabilities exchange traded otc total the fair value of otc derivative contracts is derived primarily using pricing models  which may require multiple market input parameters 
where appropriate  valuation adjustments are made to account for credit quality and market liquidity 
these adjustments are applied on a consistent basis and are based upon observable market data where available 
in the absence of observable market prices or parameters in an active market  observable prices logo 
table of contents or parameters of other comparable current market transactions  or other observable data supporting a fair value based on a pricing model at the inception of a contract  fair value is based on the transaction price 
the company also uses pricing models to manage the risks introduced by otc derivatives 
depending on the product and the terms of the transaction  the fair value of otc derivative products can be modeled using a series of techniques  including closed form analytic formulae  such as the black scholes option pricing model  simulation models or a combination thereof  applied consistently 
in the case of more established derivative products  the pricing models used by the company are widely accepted by the financial services industry 
pricing models take into account the contract terms  including the maturity  as well as market parameters such as interest rates  volatility and the creditworthiness of the counterparty 
many pricing models do not entail material subjectivity because the methodologies employed do not necessitate significant judgment  and the pricing inputs are observed from actively quoted markets  as is the case for generic interest rate swap and option contracts 
a substantial majority of otc derivative products valued by the company using pricing models fall into this category 
other derivative products  typically the newest and most complex products  will require more judgment in the implementation of the modeling technique applied due to the complexity of the modeling assumptions and the reduced price transparency surrounding the model s market parameters 
the company manages its market exposure for otc derivative products primarily by entering into offsetting derivative contracts or other related financial instruments 
the company s trading divisions  the financial control department and the market risk department continuously monitor the price changes of the otc derivatives in relation to the offsetting positions 
for a further discussion of the price transparency of the company s otc derivative products  see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management credit risk in part ii  item a 
equity and debt securities purchased in connection with private equity and other principal investment activities initially are carried in the consolidated financial statements at their original costs  which approximate fair value 
the carrying value of such securities is adjusted when changes in the underlying fair values are readily ascertainable  generally as evidenced by observable market prices or transactions that directly affect the value of such securities 
downward adjustments relating to such securities are made in the event that the company determines that the fair value is less than the carrying value 
the company s partnership interests  including general partnership and limited partnership interests in real estate funds  are included within other assets in the consolidated statements of financial condition and are recorded at fair value based upon changes in the fair value of the underlying partnership s net assets 
the company employs control processes to validate the fair value of its financial instruments  including those derived from pricing models 
these control processes are designed to assure that the values used for financial reporting are based on observable market prices or market based parameters wherever possible 
in the event that market prices or parameters are not available  the control processes are designed to assure that the valuation approach utilized is appropriate and consistently applied and that the assumptions are reasonable 
these control processes include reviews of the pricing model s theoretical soundness and appropriateness by company personnel with relevant expertise who are independent from the trading desks 
additionally  groups independent from the trading divisions within the financial control and market risk departments participate in the review and validation of the fair values generated from pricing models  as appropriate 
where a pricing model is used to determine fair value  recently executed comparable transactions and other observable market data are considered for purposes of validating assumptions underlying the model 
consistent with market practice  the company has individually negotiated agreements with certain counterparties to exchange collateral margining based on the level of fair values of the derivative contracts they have executed 
through this margining process  one party or both parties to a derivative contract provides the other party with information about the fair value of the derivative contract to calculate the amount of collateral required 
this sharing of fair value information provides additional support of the company s recorded fair value for the relevant otc derivative products 
for certain otc derivative products  the company  along with other market participants  contributes derivative pricing information to aggregation services that synthesize the data and make it accessible to subscribers 
this information is then used to evaluate the fair value of these otc derivative products

allowance for consumer loan losses 
the allowance for consumer loan losses in the company s discover business is established through a charge to the provision for consumer loan losses 
provisions are made to reserve for estimated losses in outstanding loan balances 
the allowance for consumer loan losses is a significant estimate that represents management s estimate of probable losses inherent in the consumer loan portfolio 
the allowance for consumer loan losses is primarily applicable to the owned homogeneous consumer credit card loan portfolio and is evaluated quarterly for adequacy 
in calculating the allowance for consumer loan losses  the company uses a systematic and consistently applied approach 
this process starts with a migration analysis a technique used to estimate the likelihood that a consumer loan will progress through the various stages of delinquency and ultimately charge off of delinquent and current consumer credit card accounts in order to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for consumer loan losses 
the migration analysis considers uncollectible principal  interest and fees reflected in consumer loans 
in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for consumer loan losses  management also considers factors that may impact future credit loss experience  including current economic conditions  recent trends in delinquencies and bankruptcy filings  account collection management  policy changes  account seasoning  loan volume and amounts  payment rates and forecasting uncertainties 
a provision for consumer loan losses is charged against earnings to maintain the allowance for consumer loan losses at an appropriate level

aircraft under operating leases 
aircraft held for sale 
on august   the company announced that its board of directors had approved management s recommendation to sell the company s non core aircraft leasing business 
in connection with this action  the aircraft leasing business was classified as held for sale under the provisions of sfas no 
and reported as discontinued operations in the company s consolidated financial statements 
the aircraft portfolio was not depreciated after august  in addition  in the third quarter of fiscal  the company recognized a charge of approximately billion billion after tax to reflect the write down of the aircraft leasing business to its estimated fair value of approximately billion 
in determining the charge that was recorded in the third quarter of fiscal  the company estimated the value to be realized in selling the aircraft leasing business as a whole 
the estimated value of the business was based on the appraised values of the aircraft portfolio  an evaluation of then current market conditions  recent transactions involving the sales of similar aircraft leasing businesses  a detailed assessment of the portfolio and additional valuation analyses 
on january   the company announced that it had signed a definitive agreement under which it will sell its aircraft leasing business to terra firma  a european private equity group  for approximately billion in cash and the assumption of liabilities 
based on the terms of the agreement and in accordance with sfas no 
 the company revised its estimate of the fair value less selling costs of the aircraft leasing business and  as a result  in the fourth quarter reduced the pre tax charge recorded in the third quarter of fiscal by approximately billion 
full year results for fiscal reflected a charge of million million after tax 
the sale is subject to customary regulatory approvals and closing conditions and is expected to close in the first half of logo 
table of contents aircraft to be held and used 
prior to the third quarter of fiscal  aircraft under operating leases that were to be held and used were stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment charges 
depreciation was calculated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the aircraft asset  which was generally years from the date of manufacture 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the company s aircraft that were to be held and used were reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying value of the aircraft may not be recoverable 
under sfas no 
 the carrying value of an aircraft may not be recoverable if its projected undiscounted cash flows are less than its carrying value 
if an aircraft s projected undiscounted cash flows were less than its carrying value  the company recognized an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the aircraft 
the fair value of the company s impaired aircraft was based upon the average market appraisal values obtained from independent appraisal companies 
estimates of future cash flows associated with the aircraft assets as well as the appraisals of fair value are critical to the determination of whether an impairment exists and the amount of the impairment charge  if any see note to the consolidated financial statements 
legal  regulatory and tax contingencies 
in the normal course of business  the company has been named  from time to time  as a defendant in various legal actions  including arbitrations  class actions and other litigation  arising in connection with its activities as a global diversified financial services institution 
certain of the actual or threatened legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory and or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages 
in some cases  the issuers that would otherwise be the primary defendants in such cases are bankrupt or in financial distress 
the company is also involved  from time to time  in other reviews  investigations and proceedings both formal and informal by governmental and self regulatory agencies regarding the company s business  including  among other matters  accounting and operational matters  certain of which may result in adverse judgments  settlements  fines  penalties  injunctions or other relief 
the number of these reviews  investigations and proceedings has increased in recent years with regard to many firms in the financial services industry  including the company 
reserves for litigation and regulatory proceedings are generally determined on a case by case basis and represent an estimate of probable losses after considering  among other factors  the progress of each case  prior experience and the experience of others in similar cases  and the opinions and views of internal and external legal counsel 
in view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters  particularly in cases where claimants seek substantial or indeterminate damages or where investigations and proceedings are in the early stages  the company cannot predict with certainty the loss or range of loss  if any  related to such matters  how such matters will be resolved  when they will ultimately be resolved  or what the eventual settlement  fine  penalty or other relief  if any  might be 
the company is subject to the income tax laws of the us  its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which the company has significant business operations 
these tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities 
the company must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws when determining the provision for income taxes and must also make estimates about when in the future certain items affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions 
disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit 
the company regularly assesses the likelihood of assessments in each of the taxing jurisdictions resulting from current and subsequent years examinations  and tax reserves are established as appropriate 
the company establishes reserves for potential losses that may arise out of litigation  regulatory proceedings and tax audits to the extent that such losses are probable and can be estimated in accordance with sfas no 
once established  reserves are adjusted when there is more information available or when an event occurs requiring a logo 
table of contents change 
significant judgment is required in making these estimates  and the actual cost of a legal claim  tax assessment or regulatory fine penalty may ultimately be materially different from the recorded reserves  if any

certain factors affecting results of operations 
the company s results of operations may be materially affected by market fluctuations and by economic factors 
in addition  results of operations in the past have been  and in the future may continue to be  materially affected by many factors of a global nature  including political  economic and market conditions  the availability and cost of capital  the level and volatility of equity prices  commodity prices and interest rates  currency values and other market indices  technological changes and events  the availability and cost of credit  inflation  and investor sentiment and confidence in the financial markets 
in addition  there continues to be a heightened level of legislative  legal and regulatory developments related to the financial services industry that potentially could increase costs  thereby affecting future results of operations 
such factors also may have an impact on the company s ability to achieve its strategic objectives on a global basis

table of contents liquidity and capital resources 
the company s senior management establishes the overall liquidity and capital policies of the company 
through various risk and control committees  the company s senior management reviews business performance relative to these policies  monitors the availability of alternative sources of financing  and oversees the liquidity and interest rate and currency sensitivity of the company s asset and liability position 
these committees  along with the company s treasury department and other control groups  also assist in evaluating  monitoring and controlling the impact that the company s business activities have on its consolidated balance sheet  liquidity and capital structure  thereby helping to ensure that its business activities are integrated with the company s liquidity and capital policies 
for a description of the company s other principal risks and how they are monitored and managed  see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management in part ii  item a 
the company s liquidity and funding risk management policies are designed to mitigate the potential risk that the company may be unable to access adequate financing to service its financial obligations when they come due without material  adverse franchise or business impact 
the key objectives of the liquidity and funding risk management framework are to support the successful execution of the company s business strategies while ensuring ongoing and sufficient liquidity through the business cycle and during periods of financial distress 
the principal elements of the company s liquidity framework are the cash capital policy  the liquidity reserve and stress testing through the contingency funding plan 
comprehensive financing guidelines collateralized funding  long term funding strategy  surplus capacity  diversification  staggered maturities and committed credit facilities support the company s target liquidity profile 
the balance sheet 
the company monitors and evaluates the composition and size of its balance sheet 
given the nature of the company s market making and customer financing activities  the overall size of the balance sheet fluctuates from time to time 
a substantial portion of the company s total assets consists of highly liquid marketable securities and short term receivables arising principally from its institutional securities sales and trading activities 
the highly liquid nature of these assets provides the company with flexibility in financing and managing its business 
the company s total assets increased to billion at november  from billion at november  the increase was primarily due to increases in securities purchased under agreements to resell  securities borrowed and financial instruments owned largely driven by increases in corporate and other debt and corporate equities 
the increases were largely the result of higher market levels globally and an increase in client business opportunities 
balance sheet leverage ratios are one indicator of capital adequacy when viewed in the context of a company s overall liquidity and capital policies 
the company views the adjusted leverage ratio as a more relevant measure of financial risk when comparing financial services firms and evaluating leverage trends 
the company has adopted a definition of adjusted assets that excludes certain self funded assets considered to have minimal market  credit and or liquidity risk 
these low risk assets generally are attributable to the company s matched book and securities lending businesses 
adjusted assets are calculated by reducing gross assets by aggregate resale agreements and securities borrowed less non derivative short positions and assets recorded under certain provisions of sfas no

 and fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  as revised 
the adjusted leverage ratio reflects the deduction from shareholders equity of the amount of equity used to support goodwill and intangible assets as the company does not view this amount of equity as available to support its risk capital needs 
in addition  the company views junior subordinated debt issued to capital trusts as a component of its capital base given the inherent characteristics of the securities 
these characteristics include the long dated nature final maturity at issuance of years extendible at the company s option by a further years  the company s ability to defer coupon logo 
table of contents interest for up to consecutive quarters and the subordinated nature of the obligations in the capital structure

the weighted average maturity of the company s long term borrowings  based upon stated maturity dates  was approximately five years at november  subsequent to fiscal year end and through january   the company s long term borrowings net of repayments increased by approximately billion 
economic capital 
the company uses an economic capital model to determine the amount of equity capital needed to support the risk of its business activities and to ensure that the company remains adequately capitalized 
the company logo 
table of contents calculates economic capital on a going concern basis  which is defined as the amount of capital needed to run the business through the business cycle and satisfy the requirements of regulators  rating agencies and the market 
business unit economic capital allocations are evaluated by benchmarking to similarly rated peer firms by business segment 
the company believes this methodology provides an indication of the appropriate level of capital for each business segment as if each were an independent operating entity 
economic capital requirements are allocated to each business segment and are sub allocated to product lines as appropriate 
this process is intended to align equity capital with the risks in each business  provide business managers with tools for measuring and managing risk  and allow senior management to evaluate risk adjusted returns such as return on economic capital and shareholder value added to facilitate resource allocation decisions 
the company s methodology is based on an approach that assigns economic capital to each business unit based on regulatory capital usage plus additional capital for stress losses 
regulatory capital  including additional capital assigned for goodwill  intangible assets and principal investment risk  is a minimum requirement to ensure funding access and customer credibility 
the company believes it must be able to sustain stress losses and maintain capital substantially above regulatory minimums while supporting ongoing business activities 
aggregate economic capital requirements represent the minimum amount of book equity capital required under the going concern approach 
the difference between the company s consolidated common equity and aggregate economic capital denotes the company s unallocated capital position  which is not currently allocated to the business segments or reflected in business segment performance metrics 
the company assesses stress loss capital across various dimensions of market  credit  business and operational risks 
stress losses are defined at the to confidence interval in order to capture worst potential losses in to years 
stress loss calculations are tangible and transparent and avoid reliance on extreme loss statistical models 
market risk scenarios capture systematic  idiosyncratic and random market risk through the use of internal market stress data 
credit risk is included in the form of idiosyncratic counterparty default events 
business risk incorporates earnings volatility due to variability in revenue flows  with estimates on the mix of fixed versus variable expenses at various points in the business cycle 
operational stress losses primarily reflect legal risk across the company 
the company may enhance the economic capital model and allocation methodology over time in response to changes in the business and regulatory environment to ensure that the model continues to reflect the risks inherent in the company s business activities and to reflect changes in the drivers of the level and cost of required capital

table of contents equity capital management policies 
the company s senior management views equity capital as an important source of financial strength and  therefore  pursues a strategy of ensuring that the company s equity base adequately reflects and provides protection from the economic risks inherent in its businesses 
capital is required for  among other things  the company s inventories  underwritings  principal investments  consumer loans  bridge loans and other financings  and investments in fixed assets  including aircraft assets see discontinued operations herein 
the company also considers return on common equity to be an important measure of its performance  in the context of both the particular business environment in which the company is operating and its peer group s results 
in this regard  the company actively manages its consolidated equity capital position based upon  among other things  business opportunities  capital availability and rates of return together with internal capital policies  regulatory requirements and rating agency guidelines and  therefore  in the future may expand or contract its equity capital base to address the changing needs of its businesses 
the company attempts to maintain total equity  on a consolidated basis  at least equal to the sum of its operating subsidiaries equity 
at november   the company s equity capital which includes shareholders equity and junior subordinated debt issued to capital trusts was billion  an increase of billion from november  the company returns internally generated equity capital that is in excess of the needs of its businesses to its shareholders through common stock repurchases and dividends 
the board of directors has authorized the company to purchase  subject to market conditions and certain other factors  shares of common stock for capital management purposes 
there were no repurchases made under the capital management authorization during fiscal the unused portion of this authorization at january  was approximately million

table of contents liquidity management policies 
the primary goal of the company s liquidity and funding activities is to ensure adequate financing over a wide range of potential credit ratings and market environments 
given the highly liquid nature of the company s balance sheet  day to day funding requirements are largely fulfilled through the use of stable collateralized financing 
the company has centralized management of credit sensitive unsecured funding sources in the treasury department 
in order to meet target liquidity requirements and withstand an unforeseen contraction in credit availability  the company has designed a liquidity management framework 
liquidity management framework designed to contingency funding plan ascertain the company s ability to manage a prolonged liquidity contraction and provide a course of action over a one year time period to ensure orderly functioning of the businesses 
the contingency funding plan sets forth the process and the internal and external communication flows necessary to ensure effective management of the contingency event 
analytical processes exist to periodically evaluate and report the liquidity risk exposures of the organization under management defined scenarios 
cash capital ensure that the company can fund its balance sheet while repaying its financial obligations maturing within one year without issuing new unsecured debt 
the company attempts to achieve this by maintaining sufficient cash capital long term debt and equity capital to finance illiquid assets and the portion of its securities inventory that is not expected to be financed on a secured basis in a credit stressed environment 
liquidity reserve maintain  at all times  a liquidity reserve composed of immediately available cash and cash equivalents and a pool of unencumbered securities that can be sold or pledged to provide same day liquidity to the company 
the reserve is periodically assessed and determined based on day to day funding requirements and strategic liquidity targets 
the liquidity reserve averaged approximately billion during fiscal  of which approximately billion on average was held at the parent company 
contingency funding plan 
the company s contingency funding plan cfp model incorporates a wide range of potential cash outflows during a liquidity stress event  including  but not limited to  the following i repayment of all unsecured debt maturing within one year  ii maturity roll off of outstanding letters of credit with no further issuance and replacement with cash collateral  iii return of unsecured securities borrowed and any cash raised against these securities  iv additional collateral that would be required by counterparties in the event of a ratings downgrade  v higher haircuts on or lower availability of secured funding  vi client cash withdrawals  vii drawdowns on unfunded commitments provided to third parties  and viii discretionary unsecured debt buybacks 
the company s cfp is developed at the legal entity level in order to capture specific cash requirements and availability for the parent company and each of its major operating subsidiaries 
the cfp assumes that the parent company does not have access to cash that may be trapped at subsidiaries due to regulatory  legal or tax constraints 
in addition  the cfp assumes that the parent company does not draw down on its committed credit facilities 
bank subsidiaries that operate in a deposit protected environment are not expected to be impacted by a company specific credit event and are expected to continue to provide reliable funding for assets held in these entities 
these entities include discover bank  which primarily funds credit card receivables  and morgan stanley bank  which funds senior loans and certain mortgage assets 
discover bank also accesses the asset backed financing market for a significant portion of its funding requirements 
logo 
table of contents cash capital 
the company maintains a cash capital model that measures long term funding sources against requirements 
sources of cash capital include the parent company s equity and the non current portion of certain long term borrowings 
uses of cash capital include the following i illiquid assets such as buildings  aircraft see discontinued operations herein  equipment  goodwill and intangible assets  exchange memberships  deferred tax assets and principal investments  ii a portion of securities inventory that is not expected to be financed on a secured basis in a credit stressed environment ie  stressed haircuts  and iii expected drawdowns on unfunded commitments 
the company seeks to maintain a surplus cash capital position 
the company s equity capital of billion including junior subordinated debt issued to capital trusts  long term borrowings debt obligations scheduled to mature in more than months of billion and capital units of million comprised the company s total capital of billion as of november   which substantially exceeded cash capital requirements 
liquidity reserve 
the company seeks to maintain a target liquidity reserve that is sized to cover daily funding needs and to meet strategic liquidity targets  including coverage of a significant portion of expected cash outflows over a short term horizon in a potential liquidity crisis 
this liquidity reserve is held in the form of cash deposits with banks and a pool of unencumbered securities 
the company manages the pool of unencumbered securities  against which funding can be raised  on a global basis  and securities for the pool are chosen accordingly 
the us component  held in the form of a reverse repurchase agreement at the parent company  consists primarily of us government bonds and at november  was approximately billion and averaged approximately billion for the year ended november  the non us component consists of european government bonds and other high quality collateral 
the parent company cash component of the liquidity reserve at november  was approximately billion and averaged approximately billion for the year ended november  the company believes that diversifying the form in which its liquidity reserve cash and securities is maintained enhances its ability to quickly and efficiently source funding in a stressed environment 
the company s funding requirements and target liquidity reserve may vary based on changes in the level and composition of its balance sheet  timing of specific transactions  client financing activity  market conditions and seasonal factors 
committed credit facilities 
the maintenance of committed credit facilities serves to further diversify the company s funding sources 
the company values committed credit as a secondary component of its liquidity management framework 
the committed credit facilities include a diversification of lenders to the company covering geographic regions  including north america  europe and asia 
the company maintains a senior revolving credit agreement with a group of banks to support general liquidity needs  including the issuance of commercial paper  which consists of two separate tranches a us dollar tranche with the company as borrower and a japanese yen tranche with morgan stanley japan limited msjl as borrower and the company as guarantor

the company also maintains a revolving credit facility that enables morgan stanley co 
international limited msil  the company s london based broker dealer subsidiary  to obtain committed funding from a syndicate of banks the msil facility by providing a broad range of collateral under repurchase agreements for a secured repo facility and a company guarantee for an unsecured facility 
the syndicate of banks is committed to provide up to an aggregate of billion  available in six major currencies 
at november   msil had a billion surplus shareholders funds and a billion surplus financial resources under uk gaap each as determined in accordance with the msil facility as compared with the msil facility s covenant requirements 
the company anticipates that it may utilize the ms msjl facility  the ms co 
facility or the msil facility the credit facilities for short term funding from time to time see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company does not believe that any of the covenant requirements in any of its credit facilities will impair its ability to obtain funding under the credit facilities  to pay its current level of dividends  or to obtain loan arrangements  letters of credit or other financial accommodations 
at november   no borrowings were outstanding under any of the credit facilities 
the company and its subsidiaries also maintain certain committed bilateral credit facilities to support general liquidity needs 
these facilities are expected to be drawn from time to time to cover short term funding needs 
on a yearly basis  the company s committed credit strategy is reviewed and approved by its senior management 
this strategy takes the company s total liquidity sources into consideration when determining the appropriate size and mix of committed credit 
the company  through one of its subsidiaries  maintains several funded committed credit facilities to support the collateralized commercial and residential mortgage whole loan business 
lenders to these facilities provided an aggregate of billion in financing at november  funding management policies 
the company funds its balance sheet on a global basis through diverse sources 
these sources include the company s equity capital  long term debt  repurchase agreements  us  canadian  euro  japanese and australian commercial paper  asset backed securitizations  letters of credit  unsecured bond borrowings  securities lending  buy sell agreements  municipal reinvestments  promissory notes  master notes  and committed and uncommitted lines of credit 
repurchase agreement transactions  securities lending and a portion of the company s bank borrowings are made on a collateralized basis and  therefore  provide a more stable source of funding than short term unsecured borrowings 
the company has active financing programs for both standard and structured products in the us  european and asian markets  targeting global investors and currencies such as the us dollar  euro  british pound  australian dollar and japanese yen 
the company s bank subsidiaries solicit deposits from consumers  purchase federal funds  issue short term institutional certificates of deposits and issue bank notes 
interest bearing deposits are classified by type as savings  brokered and other time deposits 
savings deposits consist primarily of money market deposit accounts sold nationally and savings deposits obtained from individual securities clients 
brokered deposits consist primarily of certificates of deposit issued by the company s bank subsidiaries 
other time deposits include individual and institutional certificates of deposit 
the company s funding management policies are designed to provide for financings that are executed in a manner that reduces the risk of disruption to the company s operations that would result from an interruption in the availability of the company s funding sources 
the company pursues a strategy of diversification of funding logo 
table of contents sources by product  by investor and by region and attempts to ensure that the tenor of the company s liabilities equals or exceeds the expected holding period of the assets being financed 
maturities of financings are designed to manage exposure to refinancing risk in any one period 
the company maintains a surplus of unused short term funding sources at all times to withstand any unforeseen contraction in credit capacity 
in addition  the company attempts to maintain cash and unhypothecated marketable securities equal to at least of its outstanding short term unsecured borrowings 
the company also maintains committed credit facilities described above to support its ongoing borrowing programs 
secured financing 
a substantial portion of the company s total assets consists of highly liquid marketable securities and short term receivables arising principally from its institutional securities sales and trading activities 
the highly liquid nature of these assets provides the company with flexibility in financing these assets with stable collateralized borrowings  while the securitization market allows for the securitization of the credit card receivables arising from the company s discover business 
the company s goal is to maximize funding through less credit sensitive collateralized borrowings and asset securitizations in order to reduce reliance on unsecured financing 
the institutional securities business emphasizes the use of collateralized short term borrowings to limit the growth of short term unsecured funding  which is more typically subject to disruption during periods of financial stress 
as part of this effort  the institutional securities business continually seeks to expand its global secured borrowing capacity 
similarly  discover  through its use of the securitization market  reduces the need for other unsecured parent company financing 
unsecured financing 
the company views long term debt as a stable source of funding for core inventories  consumer loans and illiquid assets 
in general  securities inventories not financed by secured funding sources and the majority of current assets are financed with a combination of short term funding  floating rate long term debt or fixed rate long term debt swapped to a floating rate 
fixed assets are financed with fixed rate long term debt 
both fixed rate and floating rate long term debt in addition to sources of funds accessed directly by the company s discover business are used to finance the company s consumer loan portfolio 
consumer loan financing is targeted to match the repricing and duration characteristics of the loans financed 
the company uses derivative products primarily interest rate  currency and equity swaps to assist in asset and liability management  reduce borrowing costs and hedge interest rate risk see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company issues long term debt in excess of the amount necessary to meet the needs of its securities inventory and less liquid assets as determined by its cash capital policy 
in addition to these needs  long term debt funding is employed to enhance the company s liquidity position by reducing reliance on short term credit sensitive instruments eg  commercial paper and other unsecured short term borrowings 
availability and cost of financing to the company can vary depending on market conditions  the volume of certain trading and lending activities  the company s credit ratings and the overall availability of credit 
the company has a portfolio approach for managing the unsecured debt issued by the parent company 
this approach gives the company flexibility to manage the unsecured debt portfolio across maturities  currencies  investors and regions  taking into account market capacity and pricing 
down lending to subsidiaries is managed to ensure that intercompany borrowings mature before those of the parent company 
liquidity and funding policies recognize potential constraints on the company s ability to transfer funds between regulated entities and the parent company 
during fiscal  the company s long term financing strategy was driven  in part  by its continued focus on improved balance sheet strength evaluated through enhanced capital and liquidity positions  a significant factor in the maintenance of strong credit ratings 
as a result  for fiscal  billion of unsecured debt was issued excluding certain equity and credit linked products not considered to be a component of the company s cash capital 
financing transactions were structured to ensure staggered maturities  thereby mitigating refinancing logo 
table of contents risk  and a diversified investor base was targeted through sales to domestic as well as international institutional and retail clients 
unsecured debt issuance activity resulted in a net increase in the long term debt component of the cash capital portfolio of approximately billion 
credit ratings 
the company s reliance on external sources to finance a significant portion of its day to day operations makes access to global sources of financing important 
the cost and availability of unsecured financing generally are dependent on the company s short term and long term credit ratings 
factors that are significant to the determination of the company s credit ratings or that otherwise affect its ability to raise short term and long term financing include the company s level and volatility of earnings  relative positions in the markets in which it operates  geographic and product diversification  retention of key personnel  risk management policies  cash liquidity  capital structure  corporate lending credit risk  and legal and regulatory developments 
in addition  continuing consolidation in the credit card industry presents discover with stronger competitors that may challenge future growth 
a deterioration in any of the previously mentioned factors or combination of these factors may lead rating agencies to downgrade the credit ratings of the company  thereby increasing the cost to the company in obtaining unsecured funding 
in addition  the company s debt ratings can have a significant impact on certain trading revenues  particularly in those businesses where longer term counterparty performance is critical  such as otc derivative transactions  including credit derivatives and interest rate swaps 
in connection with certain otc trading agreements and certain other agreements associated with the institutional securities business  the company would be required to provide additional collateral to certain counterparties in the event of a downgrade by either moody s investors service or standard poor s 
at november   the amount of additional collateral that would be required in the event of a one notch downgrade of the company s senior debt credit rating was approximately  million 
of this amount  million relates to bilateral arrangements between the company and other parties where upon the downgrade of one party  the downgraded party must deliver incremental collateral to the other 
these bilateral downgrade arrangements are a risk management tool used extensively by the company as credit exposures are reduced if counterparties are downgraded 
as of january   the company s credit ratings were as follows commercial paper senior debt dominion bond rating service limited r middle aa low fitch ratings f aa moody s investors service p aa rating and investment information  inc a aa standard poor s a a on april   dominion bond rating service limited changed the outlook on the company s senior debt ratings from stable to negative

the company engages in securitization activities related to commercial and residential mortgage loans  us agency collateralized mortgage obligations  corporate bonds and loans  municipal bonds and other types of financial assets 
the company may retain interests in the securitized financial assets as one or more tranches of the securitization 
these retained interests are included in the logo

any changes in the fair value of such retained interests are recognized in the consolidated statements of income 
retained interests in securitized financial assets associated with the company s institutional securities business were approximately billion at november   the majority of which were related to residential mortgage loan  us agency collateralized mortgage obligation and commercial mortgage loan securitization transactions 
for further information about the company s institutional securities securitization activities  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  see note to the consolidated financial statements for information about variable interest entities  the company s arrangements with these entities and its adoption of fin  as revised

the company often may have recourse to the underlying assets held by the spes in the event payments are required under such liquidity facilities see note to the consolidated financial statements 
discover activities 
the asset securitization market is a significant source of funding for the company s discover business 
by utilizing this market  the company further diversifies its funding sources  realizes cost effective funding and reduces reliance on the company s other funding sources  including unsecured debt 
the securitization transaction structures utilized for the discover business are accounted for as sales  ie  off balance sheet transactions in accordance with us gaap see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
in connection with its credit card securitization program  the company transfers credit card receivables  on a revolving basis  to the trusts  which issue asset backed securities that are registered with the securities and exchange commission the sec  are used to support the issuance of publicly listed notes or are privately placed 
this structure includes certain features designed to protect the investors that could result in earlier than expected amortization of the transactions  potentially resulting in the need for the company to obtain alternative funding arrangements 
the primary feature relates to the availability and adequacy of cash flows in the securitized pool of receivables to meet contractual requirements economic early amortization 
economic early amortization risk reflects the possibility of negative net securitization cash flows which would occur if the coupon  contractual servicing fee and net charge offs exceeded the collections of finance charges and cardmember fees on securitized credit card receivables and is driven primarily by the trusts credit card receivables performance in particular  receivables yield  cardmember fees and credit losses incurred as well as the contractual rate of return of the asset backed securities 
in the event of an economic early amortization  receivables that otherwise would have been subsequently purchased by the trust from the company would instead continue to be recognized on the company s consolidated statements of financial condition since the cash flows generated in the trust would instead be used to repay investors in the asset backed securities 
these recognized receivables would require the company to obtain alternative funding 
the increase in bankruptcy notifications  which reflected an increase in consumers filing for bankruptcy in advance of the new us bank legislation that became effective in october  affected the discover card master trust i dcmt  a trust utilized by the company to access the securitization markets through the issuance of multiple series of securities 
the dcmt agreements contain provisions that require early amortization of securities issued by the trust if group excess spread a measure of trust profitability as further defined in the dcmt agreements falls below zero over a three month rolling average period early amortization trigger 
one particular series that supported a short term certificate program had  in addition to the standard early amortization trigger  another provision that required group excess spread be at least in order to continue to issue certificates 
in order to avoid a potential prohibition on the continued ability to issue certificates  the company decided to retire this particular series 
no series in the trust has experienced or expects to experience an early amortization event

regulatory developments 
in june  the sec issued rules that permit certain highly capitalized broker dealers that are part of a consolidated supervised entity to apply to the sec for approval to use an alternative method for calculating net capital charges the cse rules 
to obtain approval to calculate capital under the alternative method in the cse rules  a broker dealer s holding company must consent  on a voluntary basis  to group wide supervision and examination by the sec and must have in place group wide internal risk management controls and calculate capital in a manner generally consistent with the standards of the basel committee on banking supervision basel ii 
the cse rules are intended to reduce regulatory capital costs for qualifying firms by permitting such firms to use proprietary mathematical risk measurement models for regulatory capital computation and internal control purposes 
on july   the sec approved an application by ms co  one of the company s us broker dealers  for authorization to use  effective december   the alternative method of computing net capital set forth in the cse rules 
the approval allows ms co 
to use an alternative method based on mathematical models to calculate net capital charges for market and derivatives related credit risk 
the cse rules are also designed to minimize the duplicative regulatory requirements on us securities firms resulting from the european union eu directive ec concerning the supplementary supervision of financial conglomerates active in the eu 
under this directive  financial groups that conduct business through regulated financial entities in the eu must first demonstrate that they are subject to equivalent consolidated supervision at the ultimate holding company level 
on november   the uk financial services authority determined that the sec undertakes equivalent consolidated supervision for the company 
the company continues to work with its regulators on the implementation of the cse rules and basel ii capital standards 
as rules related to basel ii are released  the company will consult with regulators on the new logo

effects of inflation and changes in foreign exchange rates 
the company s assets to a large extent are liquid in nature and  therefore  are not significantly affected by inflation  although inflation may result in increases in the company s expenses  which may not be readily recoverable in the price of services offered 
to the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other adverse effects upon the securities markets  upon the value of financial instruments and upon the markets for consumer credit services  it may adversely affect the company s financial position and profitability 
a significant portion of the company s business is conducted in currencies other than the us dollar  and changes in foreign exchange rates relative to the us dollar can therefore affect the value of us dollar net assets  revenues and expenses 
potential exposures as a result of these fluctuations in currencies are closely monitored  and  where cost justified  strategies are adopted that are designed to reduce the impact of these fluctuations on the company s financial performance 
these strategies may include the financing of non us dollar assets with direct or swap based borrowings in the same currency and the use of currency forward contracts or the spot market in various hedging transactions related to net assets  revenues  expenses or cash flows

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management 
risk management policy and control structure 
risk is an inherent part of the company s business and activities 
the extent to which the company properly and effectively identifies  assesses  monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its activities is critical to its soundness and profitability 
the company s broad based portfolio of business activities helps reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on its net revenues as a whole 
the company seeks to identify  assess  monitor and manage  in accordance with defined policies and procedures  the following principal risks involved in the company s business activities market  credit  operational  legal  and liquidity and funding risk 
liquidity and funding risk is discussed in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources in part ii  item the company s currency exposure relating to its net monetary investments in non us dollar functional currency subsidiaries is discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the cornerstone of the company s risk management philosophy is protection of the company s franchise  reputation and financial standing 
the company s risk management philosophy is based on the following principles comprehensiveness  independence  accountability  defined risk tolerance and transparency 
given the importance of effective risk management to the company s reputation  senior management requires thorough and frequent communication and appropriate escalation of risk matters 
risk management at the company requires independent company level oversight  accountability of the company s business segments  constant communication  judgment  and knowledge of specialized products and markets 
the company s senior management takes an active role in the identification  assessment and management of various risks at both the company and business segment level 
in recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the global financial services business  the company s risk management philosophy  with its attendant policies  procedures and methodologies  is evolutionary in nature and subject to ongoing review and modification 
the nature of the company s risks  coupled with this risk management philosophy  informs the company s risk governance structure 
the company s risk governance structure includes the firm risk committee and the capital structure and strategic transactions committee  the chief risk officer  the internal audit department  independent control groups  and various risk control managers  committees and groups located within the business segments 
the firm risk committee  composed of the company s most senior officers  oversees the company s risk management structure 
the firm risk committee s responsibilities include oversight of the company s risk management principles  procedures and limits and the monitoring of material financial  operational and franchise risks 
the firm risk committee is overseen by the audit committee of the board of directors the audit committee 
the capital structure and strategic transactions committee the capital committee reviews strategic transactions for the company and significant changes to the company s capital structure 
the capital committee s responsibilities include reviewing measures of capital and evaluating capital resources relative to the company s risk profile and strategy 
the chief risk officer  a member of the firm risk committee  oversees compliance with company risk limits  approves certain excessions of company risk limits  reviews material market and credit risks  and reviews results of risk management processes with the audit committee 
the internal audit department provides independent risk and control assessment and reports to the audit committee and administratively to the chief legal officer 
the internal audit department periodically examines the company s operational and control environment and conducts audits designed to cover all major risk categories 
logo 
table of contents the market risk  credit risk  operational risk  financial control  treasury and law departments collectively  the company control groups  which are all independent of the company s business units  assist senior management and the firm risk committee in monitoring and controlling the company s risk through a number of control processes 
the company is committed to employing qualified personnel with appropriate expertise in each of its various administrative and business areas to implement effectively the company s risk management and monitoring systems and processes 
each business segment has a risk committee that is responsible for ensuring that the business segment  as applicable adheres to established limits for market  credit  operational and other risks  implements risk measurement  monitoring and management policies and procedures that are consistent with the risk framework established by the firm risk committee  and reviews  on a periodic basis  its aggregate risk exposures  risk exception experience  and the efficacy of its risk identification  measurement  monitoring and management policies and procedures  and related controls 
each of the company s business segments also has designated operations officers  committees and groups  including operations and information technology groups collectively  segment control groups and  together with the company control groups  the control groups to manage and monitor specific risks and report to the business segment risk committee 
the control groups work together to review the risk monitoring and risk management policies and procedures relating to  among other things  the business segment s market and credit risk profile  sales practices  pricing of consumer loans and reserve adequacy  reputation  legal enforceability  and operational and technological risks 
participation by the senior officers of the control groups helps ensure that risk policies and procedures  exceptions to risk limits  new products and business ventures  and transactions with risk elements undergo a thorough review 
the following is a discussion of the company s risk management policies and procedures for its principal risks other than liquidity and funding risk 
the discussion focuses on the company s securities activities primarily its institutional trading activities and consumer lending and related activities 
the company believes that these activities generate a substantial portion of its principal risks 
this discussion and the estimated amounts of the company s market risk exposure generated by the company s statistical analyses are forward looking statements 
however  the analyses used to assess such risks are not predictions of future events  and actual results may vary significantly from such analyses due to events in the markets in which the company operates and certain other factors described below 
market risk 
market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices  rates  indices  implied volatilities the price volatility of the underlying instrument imputed from option prices  correlations or other market factors  such as liquidity  will result in losses for a position or portfolio 
generally  the company incurs market risk as a result of trading and client facilitation activities  principally within the institutional securities business where the substantial majority of the company s value at risk var for market risk exposures is generated 
in addition  the company incurs trading related market risk within retail brokerage 
asset management incurs non trading market risk primarily from capital investments in funds and investments in private equity vehicles 
discover is also exposed to non trading market risk primarily through changes in interest rates related to its consumer lending activities 
sound market risk management is an integral part of the company s culture 
the various business units and trading desks are responsible for ensuring that market risk exposures are well managed and prudent 
the control groups help ensure that these risks are measured and closely monitored and are made transparent to senior management 
the market risk department is responsible for ensuring transparency of material market risks  monitoring compliance with established limits  and escalating risk concentrations to appropriate senior management 
to execute these responsibilities  the market risk department monitors the company s risk against limits on aggregate risk exposures  performs a variety of risk analyses  routinely reports risk summaries logo 
table of contents and maintains the company s var system 
a variety of limits are designed to control price and liquidity risk 
market risk is monitored through various measures statistically using var and related analytical measures  by measures of position sensitivity  and through routine stress testing and scenario analyses conducted by the market risk department in collaboration with the business units 
the material risks identified by these processes are summarized in reports produced by the market risk department that are circulated to  and discussed with  senior management 
sales and trading and related activities 
primary market risk exposures and market risk management 
during fiscal  the company had exposures to a wide range of interest rates  equity prices  foreign exchange rates and commodity prices and the associated implied volatilities and spreads related to the global markets in which it conducts its trading activities 
the company is exposed to interest rate and credit spread risk as a result of its market making activities and proprietary trading in interest rate sensitive financial instruments eg  risk arising from changes in the level or implied volatility of interest rates  the timing of mortgage prepayments  the shape of the yield curve and credit spreads 
the company is exposed to equity price and implied volatility risk as a result of making markets in equity securities and derivatives and maintaining proprietary positions 
the company is exposed to foreign exchange rate and implied volatility risk as a result of making markets in foreign currencies and foreign currency options and from maintaining foreign exchange positions 
the company is exposed to commodity price and implied volatility risk as a result of market making activities and maintaining positions in physical commodities such as crude and refined oil products  natural gas  electricity  and precious and base metals and related derivatives 
the company manages its trading positions by employing a variety of risk mitigation strategies 
these strategies include diversification of risk exposures and hedging 
hedging activities consist of the purchase or sale of positions in related securities and financial instruments  including a variety of derivative products eg  futures  forwards  swaps and options 
the company manages the market risk associated with its trading activities on a company wide basis  on a worldwide trading division level and on an individual product basis 
the company manages and monitors its market risk exposures in such a way as to maintain a portfolio that the company believes is well diversified in the aggregate with respect to market risk factors and that reflects the company s aggregate risk tolerance as established by the company s senior management 
aggregate market risk limits have been approved for the company and for its major trading divisions worldwide equity and fixed income  which includes interest rate products  credit products  foreign exchange and commodities 
additional market risk limits are assigned to trading desks and  as appropriate  products and regions 
trading division risk managers  desk risk managers  traders and the market risk department monitor market risk measures against limits in accordance with policies set by senior management 
the market risk department independently reviews the company s trading portfolios on a regular basis from a market risk perspective utilizing var and other quantitative and qualitative risk measures and analyses 
the company s trading businesses and the market risk department also use  as appropriate  measures such as sensitivity to changes in interest rates  prices  implied volatilities and time decay to monitor and report market risk exposures 
stress testing  which measures the impact on the value of existing portfolios of specified changes in market factors for certain products  is performed periodically and is reviewed by trading division risk managers  desk risk managers and the market risk department 
the market risk department also conducts scenario analyses  which estimate the company s revenue sensitivity to a set of specific  predefined market and geopolitical events 
value at risk var 
the company uses the statistical technique known as var as one of the tools used to measure  monitor and review the market risk exposures of its trading portfolios 
the market risk department calculates and distributes daily var based risk measures to various levels of management 
logo 
table of contents var methodology  assumptions and limitations 
the company estimates var using a model based on historical simulation for major market risk factors and monte carlo simulation for name specific risk in certain equity and fixed income exposures 
historical simulation involves constructing a distribution of hypothetical daily changes in the value of trading portfolios based on two sets of inputs historical observation of daily changes in key market indices or other market factors market risk factors  and information on the sensitivity of the portfolio values to these market risk factor changes 
the company s var model uses approximately four years of historical data to characterize potential changes in market risk factors 
the company s one day var corresponds to the unrealized loss in portfolio value that  based on historically observed market risk factor movements  would have been exceeded with a frequency of  or once in every trading days  if the portfolio were held constant for one day 
the company s var model generally takes into account linear and non linear exposures to price risk and interest rate risk  and linear exposures to implied volatility risks 
market risks that are incorporated in the var model include equity and commodity prices  interest rates  foreign exchange rates and associated implied volatilities 
as a supplement to the use of historical simulation for major market risk factors  the company s var model uses monte carlo simulation to capture name specific risk in equities and credit products ie  corporate bonds and credit derivatives 
the company s var models evolve over time in response to changes in the composition of trading portfolios and to improvements in modeling techniques and systems capabilities 
as part of regular process improvement  additional systematic and name specific risk factors may be added to improve the var model s ability to more accurately estimate risks to specific asset classes or industry sectors 
among their benefits  var models permit estimation of a portfolio s aggregate market risk exposure  incorporating a range of varied market risks  reflect risk reduction due to portfolio diversification or hedging activities  and can cover a wide range of portfolio assets 
however  var risk measures should be interpreted carefully in light of the methodology s limitations  which include the following past changes in market risk factors may not always yield accurate predictions of the distributions and correlations of future market movements  changes in portfolio value in response to market movements especially for complex derivative portfolios may differ from the responses calculated by a var model  var using a one day time horizon does not fully capture the market risk of positions that cannot be liquidated or hedged within one day  the historical market risk factor data used for var estimation may provide only limited insight into losses that could be incurred under market conditions that are unusual relative to the historical period used in estimating the var  and published var results reflect past trading positions while future risk depends on future positions 
the company is aware of these and other limitations and  therefore  uses var as only one component in its risk management oversight process 
as explained above  this process also incorporates stress testing and scenario analyses and extensive risk monitoring  analysis  and control at the trading desk  division and company levels 
var for fiscal the table below presents the company s aggregate trading and non trading  trading and non trading var for each of the company s primary market risk exposures at november  and november   incorporating substantially all financial instruments generating market risk that are managed by the company s trading businesses 
this measure of var incorporates most of the company s trading related market risks 
however  a small proportion of trading positions generating market risk is not included in var  and the modeling of the risk characteristics of some positions relies upon approximations that  under certain circumstances  could produce significantly different var results from those produced using more precise measures 
for example  risks associated with residential mortgage backed securities have been approximated as it is difficult to capture precisely these risks within a var context 
aggregate trading and non trading var also incorporates a the funding liabilities related to institutional trading positions and b public company equity positions recorded as investments by the company 
investments made by the company that are not publicly traded are not reflected in the var results reported below 
as of november   the aggregate carrying value of such investments was approximately billion 
logo 
table of contents since the var statistics reported below are estimates based on historical position and market data  var should not be viewed as predictive of the company s future revenues or financial performance or of its ability to monitor and manage risk 
there can be no assurance that the company s actual losses on a particular day will not exceed the var amounts indicated below or that such losses will not occur more than once in trading days

this benefit arises because the simulated one day losses for each of the four primary market risk categories occur on different days  similar diversification benefits also are taken into account within each category 
the company s aggregate var and trading var at november  were million and million  respectively  compared with million and million  respectively  at november  non trading var at november  increased to million from million at november  due to an increase in non trading interest rate and credit spread var and equity price var 
non trading interest rate and credit spread var increased due to an increase in interest rate risk associated with funding liabilities 
non trading equity price var increased primarily due to a concentrated position in principal investments resulting from a recent initial public offering in which the company was an investor 
the company views average trading var over the fiscal year as more representative of trends in the business than var at any single point in time 
table below  which presents the high  low and average one day trading var during fiscal and fiscal  represents substantially all of the company s trading activities 
certain market risks included in the year end aggregate var discussed above are excluded from these measures eg  equity price risk in public company equity positions recorded as principal investments by the company and certain funding liabilities related to trading positions 
average trading var for fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal  reflecting increases in interest rate and credit spread var and commodity price var 
the increase in interest rate and credit spread var was predominantly driven by increased exposures to credit sensitive instruments eg  corporate debt securities and to interest rate levels 
the increase in commodity price var was predominantly driven by increased exposures to energy ie  natural gas and electricity and oil products ie  crude and distillates

table of contents var statistics for comparisons with other global financial services firms 
var statistics are not readily comparable across firms because of differences in the breadth of products included in the var model  in the statistical assumptions made when simulating changes in market factors  and in the methods used to approximate portfolio revaluations under the simulated market conditions 
these differences can result in materially different var estimates for similar portfolios 
as a result  var statistics are more reliable and relevant when used as indicators of trends in risk taking within a firm rather than as a basis for inferring differences in risk taking across firms 
table below presents the var statistics that would result if the company were to adopt alternative parameters for its calculations  such as the reported confidence level versus for the var statistic or a shorter historical time series four years versus one year  for market data upon which it bases its simulations table average and trading var with four year one year historical time series average one day var for fiscal average one day var for fiscal primary market risk category four year factor history one year factor history four year factor history one year factor history dollars in millions interest rate and credit spread equity price foreign exchange rate commodity price trading var in addition  if the company were to report trading var using a four year historical time series with respect to a day holding period  the company s and average trading var for fiscal would have been million and million  respectively 
logo 
table of contents distribution of var statistics and net revenues for fiscal as shown in table above  the company s average one day trading var for fiscal was million 
the histogram below presents the distribution of the company s daily one day trading var for fiscal the most frequently occurring value was between million and million  while for approximately of trading days during the fiscal year  var ranged between million and million 
logo one method of evaluating the reasonableness of the company s var model as a measure of the company s potential volatility of net revenue is to compare the var with actual trading revenue 
assuming no intra day trading  for a one day var  the expected number of times that trading losses should exceed var during the fiscal year is three  and  in general  if trading losses were to exceed var more than five times in a year  the accuracy of the var model could be questioned 
accordingly  the company evaluates the reasonableness of its var model by comparing the potential declines in portfolio values generated by the model with actual trading results 
the histogram below shows the distribution of daily net revenue during fiscal for the company s trading businesses including net interest and commissions but excluding primary and prime brokerage revenue credited to the trading businesses 
there were no days during fiscal in which the company incurred daily trading losses in excess of the one day trading var for that given day 
additionally  there were no days during fiscal where the largest one day loss exceeded the lowest one day trading var reported in table above 
logo 
table of contents logo consumer lending and related activities 
interest rate risk and management 
in its consumer lending activities  the company is exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates 
such changes in interest rates impact interest earning assets  principally credit card and other consumer loans and net excess servicing fees received in connection with consumer loans sold through asset securitizations  as well as the interest sensitive liabilities that finance these assets  including asset backed securitizations  long term borrowings and deposits 
the company s interest rate risk management policies are designed to reduce the potential volatility of earnings that may arise from changes in interest rates by having a financing portfolio that reflects the existing repricing schedules of consumer loans as well as the company s right  with notice to cardmembers  to reprice certain fixed rate consumer loans to a new interest rate in the future 
to the extent that asset and related financing repricing characteristics of a particular portfolio are not matched effectively  the company utilizes interest rate derivative contracts  such as swap agreements  to achieve its objectives 
interest rate swap agreements effectively convert the underlying asset or financing from fixed to variable repricing or from variable to fixed repricing 
sensitivity analysis methodology  assumptions and limitations 
for its consumer lending activities  the company uses a variety of techniques to assess its interest rate risk exposure  one of which is interest rate sensitivity simulation 
for purposes of presenting the possible earnings effect of a hypothetical  adverse change in interest rates over the month period from its fiscal year end  the company assumes that all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities will be impacted by a hypothetical  immediate basis point increase in interest rates as of the beginning of the period 
interest rate sensitive assets are assumed to be those for which the stated interest rate is not contractually fixed for the next month period 
a portion of the company s credit card receivables has a fixed interest rate  although the company has the right  with notice to cardmembers  to subsequently reprice these receivables to a new interest rate 
therefore  the company considers the receivables with a fixed interest rate to be interest rate sensitive 
the company measured the earnings sensitivity for these assets from the expected repricing date  which takes into consideration the required notice period and billing cycles 
in addition  assets that have a market based index  such as the prime rate  which will reset before the end of the month period  or assets with logo 
table of contents rates that are fixed at fiscal year end but which will mature  or otherwise contractually reset to a market based indexed or other fixed rate prior to the end of the month period  are rate sensitive 
the latter category includes certain credit card loans that may be offered at below market rates for an introductory period  such as for balance transfers and special promotional programs  after which the loans will contractually reprice in accordance with the company s normal market based pricing structure 
for purposes of measuring rate sensitivity for such loans  only the effect of the hypothetical basis point change in the underlying market based indexed or other fixed rate has been considered rather than the full change in the rate to which the loan would contractually reprice 
for assets that have a fixed interest rate at fiscal year end but which contractually will  or are assumed to  reset to a market based indexed or other fixed rate during the next months  earnings sensitivity is measured from the expected repricing date 
in addition  for all interest rate sensitive assets  earnings sensitivity is calculated net of expected loan losses 
interest rate sensitive liabilities are assumed to be those for which the stated interest rate is not contractually fixed for the next month period 
thus  liabilities that have a market based index  such as the commercial paper or libor rates  which will reset before the end of the month period  or liabilities whose rates are fixed at fiscal year end but which will mature and are assumed to be replaced with a market based indexed rate prior to the end of the month period  are rate sensitive 
for these fixed rate liabilities  earnings sensitivity is measured from the expected repricing date 
assuming a hypothetical  immediate basis point increase in the interest rates affecting all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities as of november   it is estimated that the pre tax income of consumer lending and related activities over the following month period would be reduced by approximately million 
the comparable reduction of pre tax income for the month period following november  was estimated to be approximately million 
the decrease in the reduction in pre tax income at november  was due to a higher level of variable interest rate assets 
the hypothetical model assumes that the balances of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities at fiscal year end will remain constant over the next month period 
it does not assume any growth  strategic change in business focus  change in asset pricing philosophy or change in asset liability funding mix 
thus  this model represents a static analysis that cannot adequately portray how the company would respond to significant changes in market conditions 
furthermore  the analysis does not necessarily reflect the company s expectations regarding the movement of interest rates in the near term  including the likelihood of an immediate basis point change in market interest rates  nor necessarily the actual effect on earnings if such rate changes were to occur 
credit risk 
credit risk refers to the risk of loss arising from borrower or counterparty default when a borrower  counterparty or obligor is unable to meet its financial obligations 
the company is exposed to three distinct types of credit risk in its businesses 
the company incurs significant  single name credit risk exposure through the institutional securities business 
this type of risk requires credit analysis of specific counterparties  both initially and on an ongoing basis 
the company incurs individual consumer credit risk in the retail brokerage business through margin loans to individual investors  which are generally collateralized  and loans to small businesses 
the company incurs consumer portfolio credit risk in the discover business primarily through cardholder receivables 
credit risk in a pool of credit card receivables is generally highly diversified  without significant individual exposures  and  accordingly  is managed on a portfolio and not a single name basis 
the company has structured its credit risk management framework to reflect that each of these businesses generates unique credit risks that are appropriately managed discretely 
the institutional credit department institutional credit manages credit risk exposure for the institutional securities business 
institutional credit is responsible for ensuring transparency of material credit risks  ensuring compliance with established limits  approving material extensions of credit  and escalating risk concentrations to appropriate senior management 
credit risk exposure in the retail brokerage business is managed through various credit risk committees  whose membership includes institutional credit 
the retail brokerage risk management department is responsible for logo 
table of contents monitoring  measuring and analyzing credit risk exposures  including margin loans and credit sensitive  higher risk transactions 
credit risk exposure in the discover business is managed through the discover credit and market risk committee  which  in turn  is supported by business line specific risk committees and the credit risk management department  which is responsible for the development  validation and implementation of credit policy criteria  for predictive models  for the monitoring of performance for both new and existing products  and for oversight of adherence to existing policies and limits 
institutional securities activities 
lending 
in connection with certain of its institutional securities business activities  the company provides loans or lending commitments including bridge financing to selected clients 
these loans and commitments have varying terms  may be senior or subordinated  may be secured or unsecured  are generally contingent upon representations  warranties and contractual conditions applicable to the borrower  and may be syndicated or traded by the company 
the borrowers may be rated investment grade or non investment grade 
credit risk with respect to loans and lending commitments arises from the failure of a borrower to perform according to the terms of the loan agreement 
securitized products 
the company also extends loans and lending commitments to clients that are secured by assets of the borrower and generally provide for over collateralization  including commercial real estate  loans secured by loan pools  corporate and operating company loans  and secured lines of revolving credit 
credit risk with respect to these loans and lending commitments arises from the failure of a borrower to perform according to the terms of the loan agreement and a decline in collateral value 
other 
in addition to the activities performed by institutional credit  there are credit risks managed by various business areas within institutional securities 
for example  certain businesses with heightened settlement risk monitor compliance with established settlement risk limits 
certain risk management activities as it pertains to establishing appropriate collateral amounts for the company s prime brokerage and securitized product businesses are primarily monitored within those areas in that they determine the appropriate collateral level for each strategy or position 
in addition  a collateral management group monitors collateral levels against requirements and oversees the administration of the collateral function 
derivative contracts 
in the normal course of business  the company enters into a variety of derivative contracts related to financial instruments and commodities 
the company uses these instruments for trading and investment purposes  as well as for asset and liability management 
these instruments generally represent future commitments to swap interest payment streams  exchange currencies  or purchase or sell commodities and other financial instruments on specific terms at specified future dates 
many of these products have maturities that do not extend beyond one year  although swaps  options and equity warrants typically have longer maturities 
the company incurs credit risk as a dealer in otc derivatives 
credit risk with respect to derivative instruments arises from the failure of a counterparty to perform according to the terms of the contract 
the company s exposure to credit risk at any point in time is represented by the fair value of the derivative contracts reported as assets

analyzing credit risk 
credit risk management takes place at the transaction  counterparty and portfolio levels

these credit ratings are intended to assess a counterparty s probability of default and are derived using methodologies generally consistent with those employed by external rating agencies 
credit ratings of bb or below are considered non investment grade 
additionally  institutional credit assigns a facility rating to lending facilities 
the facility rating incorporates the relative position of the particular obligation in the borrower s capital structure and relative recovery prospects 
the company has credit guidelines that limit potential credit exposure to any one borrower or counterparty and to aggregates of borrowers or counterparties
