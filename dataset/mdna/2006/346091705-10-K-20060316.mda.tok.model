item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
all expectations  forecasts  assumptions  and beliefs about our future financial results  condition  operations  strategic plans  and performance are forward looking statements  as described in more detail in part i  item under the heading forward looking statements 
our actual results may differ materially because of a number of risks and uncertainties 
some of these risks and uncertainties are detailed in item a under the heading risk factors  and elsewhere in this form k 
historical statements made herein are accurate only as of the date of filing of this form k with the securities and exchange commission and may be relied upon only as of that date 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with forest s consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements 
overview forest is an independent oil and gas company engaged in the exploration  development  acquisition  and production of natural gas and liquids primarily in north america 
recent developments spin off of offshore gulf of mexico operations on march   forest completed the spin off of its offshore gulf of mexico operations by means of a special stock dividend  which consisted of a pro rata spin off the spin off of all outstanding shares of forest energy resources  inc feri  a total of  shares of common stock  to holders of record of forest common stock as of the close of business on february  immediately following the spin off  feri was merged with a subsidiary of mariner energy  inc mariner in a stock for stock transaction the merger 
mariner commenced trading on the new york stock exchange on march  the spin off was completed without the payment of consideration by forest shareholders and consisted of a special stock dividend of shares of feri for each outstanding share of forest common stock 
the merger was accomplished by the exchange of all issued and outstanding shares of feri for shares of common stock of mariner  with each whole share of feri exchanged for one share of mariner common stock 
the spin off is intended to be a tax free transaction for federal income tax purposes 
prior to the merger  as part of the spin off  feri paid forest an initial cash amount equal to approximately million 
the cash amount is subject to further adjustment to reflect an economic effective date for the transaction of july  cotton valley acquisition on february   forest announced plans to acquire assets located primarily in the cotton valley trend in east texas 
forest agreed to pay approximately million  subject to customary adjustments  for properties with an estimated bcfe of proved reserves and production that averaged mmcfe per day in january in addition to the reserves and production  forest will also gain approximately  net acres in the fields  of which approximately  net acres are undeveloped 
the transaction is expected to close in march and is subject to customary closing conditions 
this acquisition is expected to provide another core area of growth and add significant onshore activity to the southern business unit 
highlights highlights of forest s performance in were increased revenue oil and gas sales exceeded billion despite hurricane activity that deferred approximately bcfe of production 
increased reserves forest s year end estimated proved reserves were  bcfe  higher than year end  notwithstanding bcfe of production in and oil and gas property sales of bcfe 
exploration and development track record forest had continuing success in with its buffalo wallow project and foothills wild river projects in canada 
drilling well counts for increased to a record without san juan wells  with a success rate 
acquisition accomplishments forest invested million including approximately million of deferred tax gross up and excluding million of goodwill each recorded in connection with a business combination to acquire bcfe of estimated proved reserves 
reduced leverage forest ended the year with a total debt to book capitalization ratio of 
hurricane impact during  our gulf of mexico operations were adversely affected by one of the most active hurricane seasons in recorded history 
as of december   forest had approximately mmcfe per day of net production shut in relating to forest s offshore gulf of mexico operations 
forest estimates that total production operations deferred for hurricanes katrina and rita in the third and fourth quarters of was approximately bcfe 
we carry property and casualty insurance to insure against property damages such as those caused by hurricanes 
the insurance has a million deductible for each occurrence 
our estimated uninsured liability for the repair of our facilities damaged by hurricanes in the third quarter of is million  the majority of which was incurred in the fourth quarter of as the related expenditures were made 
forest s insurance does not include business interruption for shut in production 
as a result of the completion of the spin off  the residual effects of the hurricanes on our operations have been largely eliminated 
we expect that the risks associated with future hurricane activity will be largely diminished although production interruptions may still occur to the extent third party transportation and processing facilities are damaged or if our onshore properties suffer damage 
outlook in  we expect to focus on our onshore north american assets by accelerating our development and exploitation activities on legacy and newly acquired fields 
our capital budget for is million to million  not including capital expenditures planned in the cotton valley area of east texas pending the closing of the acquisition scheduled for march  of this total  approximately is expected to be directed to our large drilling programs in buffalo wallow  wild river  and the greater haley area 
we also anticipate a continued favorable commodity price environment in in our view  the economic growth and the related increased demand for oil and gas should continue to support relatively high commodity prices 
within this environment  we anticipate strong financial performance by forest 
our inventory of exploitation and exploration projects is at a high level  which should provide us good visibility of future production growth in our remaining onshore business 
our plan anticipates cash flow from operations greater than our exploration and development spending levels  which is expected to be used  in whole or in part  to fund acquisitions 
we face numerous challenges in we will be challenged in transitioning our focus to onshore oil and gas operations following the spin off 
among other matters  we must realign staff and responsibilities  adopt appropriate cost structures  and transition the offshore gulf of mexico operations to mariner 
however  as a result of the spin off  we no longer have the challenges associated with the offshore gulf of mexico operations that were subject to inherent high production declines and disruptions from hurricanes 
we expect to continue to pursue asset acquisition opportunities in  but expect to continue to confront intense competition for these assets 
also  due to a relatively high commodity price environment  we anticipate service costs as well as costs of equipment and raw materials to remain at or exceed the high levels set in our challenge will be to add reserves  through drilling and acquisitions  and operate our productive assets cost efficiently in a manner that achieves attractive returns for our shareholders 
results of operations for the year ended december   forest reported net earnings of million or per basic share  a increase compared to net earnings of million or per basic share in the corresponding period 
the increase in earnings in compared to was primarily the result of increased average oil and gas sales prices  offset partially by decreased sales volumes due to production deferrals from the hurricane season and related per unit increases in oil and gas production expense 
for the year ended december   forest reported net earnings of million or per basic share  a increase compared to net earnings of million or per basic share in the corresponding period 
the increase in earnings in compared to was due primarily to the combination of increased average oil and gas sales prices and increased sales volumes  offset partially by increased oil and gas production expense and increased depletion expense 
discussion of the components of the changes in our annual results follows 
oil and gas sales production volumes  revenues  and weighted average sales prices  by product and location for the years ended december    and are set forth in the table below

totals commodity swaps and collars were transacted to hedge the price of spot market volumes against price fluctuations 
see part ii  item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  below  concerning our hedging activities 
the increase in oil and gas sales revenue of million in compared to was the result of a increase in price realizations per mcfe partially offset by a decrease in production 
the decrease in our sales volumes between the same periods of bcfe was due primarily to approximately bcfe of deferred production due to hurricanes katrina and rita that primarily impacted our offshore gulf of mexico properties  offset by increases in our onshore north american production 
the increase in oil and gas sales revenue of million in compared to was the result of a increase in price realizations per mcfe  combined with a increase in sales volumes 
the increase in sales volumes was attributable primarily to acquisitions made during the fourth quarter of and the second quarter of oil and gas production expense the table below sets forth the detail of oil and gas production expense for the years ended december    and years ended december  in thousands except per mcfe amounts lease operating expenses loe direct operating expense and overhead    workover expense    hurricane repairs   total loe    loe per mcfe 
production and property taxes production and property taxes per mcfe 


transportation costs transportation costs per mcfe 


lease operating expenses as reflected in the table above  direct operating expenses and overhead increased only marginally in compared to while increases in workover costs made up the majority of the million increase in loe 
on a per unit basis  total loe increased to per mcfe in of from per mcfe in due primarily to hurricane activity in the third quarter of that deferred approximately bcfe of production 
loe increased approximately million from to loe from the properties acquired in late and during accounted for approximately of the increase 
the acquired properties had higher initial loe due to deferred maintenance of the properties at the time of acquisition 
forest also spent approximately million more in on workovers than it did in  approximately million of the increase related to the properties acquired in and production and property taxes production and property taxes increased million in to million as compared to million in from to  production and property taxes increased million 
the increases in each period were primarily a result of the higher realized oil and gas revenues and higher assessed property valuations 
as a percentage of oil and natural gas revenue  excluding hedging losses  production and property taxes were   and for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the increases in each period is primarily the result of a change in our production mix over the last few years to a higher percentage of onshore production  which is generally subject to production taxes  versus offshore production  which is generally not subject to production taxes 
transportation costs transportation costs were million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increased costs were a result of increases in gathering and transportation rates  as well as increases in fuel prices 
on an equivalent mcfe basis  transportation costs were   and 
per mcfe for the years ended december   and  respectively 
general and administrative expense  overhead the following table summarizes the components of total overhead costs incurred during the periods years ended december  in thousands except per mcfe amounts total overhead costs    overhead costs capitalized    total overhead costs expensed    general and administrative expense per mcfe 


the increase in total overhead costs and overhead costs expensed in as compared to was primarily related to an increase in salaries and related burdens caused by our hiring additional employees in conjunction with our recent acquisitions and general increases in salaries due to an increasingly competitive market for experienced oil and gas professionals 
the percentage of overhead capitalized remained relatively constant between the three years reflected in the table above  ranging between and 
the percentage of overhead capitalized in of was lower than the of overhead capitalized in due primarily to increases in general corporate costs 
depreciation and depletion  undeveloped properties years ended december  in thousands except per mcfe amounts depreciation and depletion expense    depreciation and depletion expense per mcfe the increases in depreciation and depletion expense on an equivalent unit of production basis of 
in compared to was due primarily to higher anticipated drilling and completion costs on future development activities as well as the effect of property divestitures in canada in late the increase in depreciation and depletion expense on an equivalent unit of production basis of 
in compared to was due primarily to downward revisions in estimated proved reserves in the fourth quarter of see discussion of the revision to the estimated proved reserves in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the following costs of undeveloped properties were not subject to depletion at the periods indicated december  united states canada international total in thousands the increase in the total undeveloped properties from to was due primarily to the additional undeveloped properties acquired in in conjunction with the buffalo wallow acquisition 
the increase in the total undeveloped properties from to was due primarily to the additional undeveloped properties acquired in in conjunction with the purchase of wiser 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the buffalo wallow and wiser acquisitions 
accretion of asset retirement obligations accretion expense of approximately million in both and  and million in was related to the accretion of forest s asset retirement obligation pursuant to sfas no 
 adopted january  sfas no 
requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred and a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
using a cumulative effect approach to adopt sfas no 
 forest recorded an after tax credit of approximately million in the first quarter of international impairments in  forest recorded an impairment of million related to certain international properties  principally related to its leaseholds in romania 
the romania impairment was recorded in the first quarter of in connection with our decision to exit the country as we rationalize our international assets to concentrate on fewer areas 
in  forest recorded impairments of oil and gas properties located outside of north america of million related to evaluations of projects in albania  germany  and italy 
in  we recorded impairments of million  related primarily to evaluations of projects in albania  italy  romania  switzerland  and tunisia 
of this amount  approximately million related to our interest in a project in albania 
interest expense interest expense of million in was greater than  primarily due to higher average interest rates partially offset by lower average debt balances 
interest expense of million in was greater than  due primarily to higher average debt balances 
realized and unrealized losses on derivative instruments realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments are primarily related to various derivatives that did not qualify for cash flow hedge accounting either at their inception or during their term 
when the criteria for cash flow hedge accounting are not met  realized gains and losses ie  cash settlements are recorded in other income expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
similarly  changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments are recorded as unrealized gains or losses in the consolidated statements of operations 
in contrast  cash settlements for derivative instruments that qualify for hedge accounting are recorded as additions to or reductions of oil and gas revenues while changes in fair value of cash flow hedges are recognized  to the extent the hedge is effective  in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the table below sets forth realized and unrealized gains and losses principally related to our derivatives that did not qualify for hedge accounting for the periods indicated 
years ended december  in thousands realized losses gains  unrealized losses gains   the significant increases in realized and unrealized losses on derivative instruments in are primarily related to the loss of hedge accounting on many of our commodity derivatives in the third and fourth quarters of due to hurricanes rita and katrina 
additionally  several commodity collars that were assumed in recent acquisitions as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements were not eligible for cash flow hedge accounting treatment 
for comparative purposes  the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  realized losses on derivative instruments that met the criteria for hedge accounting  which were recorded as reductions of oil and gas revenues 
years ended december  in thousands realized losses included in oil and gas revenue   in addition to the realized losses reflected in the tables above  forest settled approximately million in hedge losses in the fourth quarter of that were deferred until the first quarter of to correspond with the timing of the production that was deferred from hurricanes katrina and rita 
other expense income  net the components of other expense income  net for the years ended december    and were as follows years ended december  in thousands loss on extinguishment of debt  foreign currency exchange gain  franchise taxes    share of loss income of equity method investee   other  net   total other expense income  net    the foreign currency exchange gain in is related to the repayment of canadian intercompany debt denominated in us dollars 
franchise taxes are paid to the states of texas and louisiana based on capital investment deployed in these states  determined by apportioning total capital as defined by statute 
forest s share of income or loss of equity method investee relates to our ownership of a pipeline company that transports crude oil in alaska 
loss on extinguishment of debt relates to redemptions of our senior subordinated notes for amounts in excess of par value 
current and deferred income tax expense forest recorded current income tax expense before discontinued operations and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of million in compared to million in and 
million in the majority of the current income tax provision in relates to federal and state tax imposed on a dividend received from our canadian subsidiary 
we chose to repatriate these funds from our canadian subsidiary to take advantage of a special one time dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings introduced by the american jobs creation act of current tax expense in each of and was due primarily to federal alternative minimum tax and to state income taxes 
deferred income tax expense before discontinued operations and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle was million in compared to million in and million in the increase in each of the years was due primarily to increased net income before income taxes  partially offset by a decrease in canadian taxes of million  million  and million  respectively  due to reductions in canadian federal and provincial tax rates 
in total  forest s effective income tax rates for the years ended december    and  were   and  respectively 
these rates were based on a us federal statutory rate of in each of the three years 
differences between the us federal statutory rate and the effective rate were primarily due to foreign and state statutory rates and permanent book to tax differences 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of our income taxes at the statutory rate to income taxes at our effective rate for each period presented 
results of discontinued operations on march   the assets and business operations of our canadian marketing subsidiary were sold to cinergy canada  inc cinergy for million cdn 
under the terms of the purchase and sale agreement  cinergy will market natural gas on behalf of canadian forest for five years through february unless subject to prior contractual commitment  and will also administer the netback pool that we formerly administered 
we could receive additional contingent payments related to this sale over the next four years if cinergy meets certain earnings goals with respect to the acquired business 
the subsidiary s results of operations have been reported as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations for all years presented 
the components of loss from discontinued operations for the years ended december  and are as follows years ended december  in thousands marketing income  net  general and administrative expense  interest expense other expense income depreciation  current income tax expense benefit deferred income tax expense  loss on sale of discontinued operations  loss from discontinued operations  net of tax  liquidity and capital resources in  as in  we expect our cash flow from operations to be our primary source of liquidity to meet operating expenses and fund capital expenditures other than large acquisitions 
any remaining cash flow from operations will be available for acquisitions  in whole or in part  or other corporate purposes  including the repayment of indebtedness 
the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas production have a significant impact on operating cash flows 
while significant price declines in would adversely affect the amount of cash flow generated from operations  we utilize a hedging program to partially mitigate that risk 
as of march   forest has hedged approximately bcfe of its estimated onshore north american and alaskan offshore production 
this level of hedging provides certainty of the cash flow we will receive for a large portion of our expected production 
depending on changes in oil and gas futures markets and management s view of underlying oil and natural gas supply and demand trends  we may increase or decrease our current hedging positions 
for further information concerning our hedging contracts  see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk hedging program  below 
our million revolving bank credit facilities  which we entered into in september  provide another source of liquidity 
these credit facilities  which mature in september  are used to fund daily operating activities and acquisitions in the united states and canada as needed 
at march   we had approximately million of outstanding borrowings and letters of credit under the bank credit facilities  and an unused borrowing base of million 
on february  we announced plans to acquire assets in the cotton valley of east texas  for a purchase price of million 
the transaction is scheduled to close on march   subject to customary closing conditions  and we plan to use cash on hand and availability under our credit facilities to fund this acquisition 
on march   we completed the spin off of our offshore gulf of mexico operations 
these operations accounted for approximately of our total oil and gas production in and of our consolidated oil and gas revenues for the year ended december  as a result of the spin off  we expect future cash flows from operations to be significantly lower  however  we also expect a significant decrease in capital expenditures and payments for asset retirement obligations 
in connection with the spin off  we received an initial payment of approximately million subject to certain post closing adjustments to reflect an economic effective date for the transaction of july   which we used to pay down our credit facilities 
we do not believe the spin off will have a material effect on our liquidity and capital resources nor do we believe it will materially adversely effect our ability to access the capital markets 
the public capital markets have been our principal source of funds to finance large acquisitions 
we have sold debt and equity securities in both public and private offerings in the past  and we expect that these sources of capital will continue to be available to us in the future for acquisitions 
in july  we filed a shelf registration statement that allows forest to issue equity and debt securities of up to million  all of which is still available 
nevertheless  ready access to capital on reasonable terms can be impacted by our debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies and are subject to many uncertainties  including restrictions contained in our bank credit facilities and indentures for our senior notes  macroeconomic factors outside of our control  and other risks as explained in part  item a risk factors 
we believe that our available cash  cash provided by operating activities  and funds available under our bank credit facilities will be sufficient to fund our operating  interest  and general and administrative expenses  our capital expenditure budget  and our short term contractual obligations at current levels for the foreseeable future 
bank credit facilities we currently have credit facilities totaling million  consisting of a million us credit facility through a syndicate of banks led by jpmorgan chase and a million canadian credit facility through a syndicate of banks led by jpmorgan chase bank  toronto branch 
the credit facilities mature in september subject to the agreement of forest and the applicable lenders  the size of the credit facilities may be increased by million in the aggregate 
on march   there were no outstanding borrowings under the us facility and there were outstanding borrowings of million under the canadian credit facility at a weighted average interest rate of 
together with the million in letters of credit outstanding  the unused borrowing amount on march  was approximately million 
in connection with the spin off  forest received approximately million from its former subsidiary  feri  which it used to pay off its borrowings under its us credit facility 
availability under the credit facilities will be based either on certain financial covenants included in the credit facilities or on the loan value assigned to forest s oil and gas properties 
if forest s corporate credit rating by moody s is ba or higher and bb or higher by s p  the credit facilities may be governed by certain financial covenants 
alternatively  if forest s corporate credit rating is ba or lower by moody s or bb or lower by s p  availability under the credit facilities will be governed by a borrowing base global borrowing base 
currently  the amount available under the credit facilities is determined the global borrowing base 
effective october   the credit facilities were amended to permit forest to complete the spin off and the global borrowing base was increased to million 
on march   concurrent with the completion of the spin off  the global borrowing base was reduced to million  with million allocated to the us credit facility and million allocated to the canadian facility 
at december   there were outstanding borrowings of million under the us credit facility at a weighted average interest rate of  and there were outstanding borrowings of million under the canadian credit facility at a weighted average interest rate of 
we also had used the credit facilities for approximately million in letters of credit  leaving an unused borrowing amount under the global borrowing base of approximately million at december  the determination of the global borrowing base is made by the lenders taking into consideration the estimated value of forest s oil and gas properties in accordance with the lenders customary practices for oil and gas loans 
this process involves reviewing forest s estimated proved reserves and their valuation 
while the global borrowing base is in effect  it is redetermined semi annually  and the available borrowing amount could be increased or decreased as a result of such redeterminations 
in addition  forest and the lenders each have discretion at any time  but not more often than once during any calendar year  to have the global borrowing base redetermined 
a revision to forest s reserves may prompt such a request on the part of the lenders  which could possibly result in a reduction in the global borrowing base and availability under the credit facilities 
as described above  in connection with the spin off  the global borrowing base was reduced to million 
if outstanding borrowings under either of the credit facilities exceed the applicable portion of the global borrowing base  forest would be required to repay the excess amount within a prescribed period 
if we are unable to pay the excess amount  it would cause an event of default 
the credit facilities include terms and covenants that place limitations on certain types of activities  including restrictions or requirements with respect to additional debt  liens  asset sales  hedging activities  investments  dividends  mergers  and acquisitions 
the credit facilities also include several financial covenants 
availability  interest rates  security requirements  and other terms of borrowing under the credit facilities will vary based on forest s credit ratings and financial condition  as determined by certain financial tests 
in particular  any time that availability is not determined by the global borrowing base  the amount available and our ability to borrow under the credit facilities is determined by certain financial covenants 
also  even when availability is determined by the global borrowing base  certain financial covenants may affect the amount available and forest s ability to borrow amounts under the credit facilities 
the credit facilities are collateralized by a portion of our assets 
we are required to mortgage  and grant a security interest in  of the present value of our consolidated proved oil and gas properties 
we have also pledged the stock of several subsidiaries to the lenders to secure the credit facilities 
under certain circumstances  we could be obligated to pledge additional assets as collateral 
if our corporate credit ratings by moody s and s p improve and meet pre established levels  the collateral requirements would not apply and  at our request  the banks would release their liens and security interests on our properties

net cash used by financing activities in of million primarily included the net repayment of bank borrowings of million  more than offset by net proceeds from the exercise of options and warrants of approximately million 
the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in compared to of approximately million was due primarily to an increase in net income and depreciation expense a non cash expense totaling million 
the decrease in cash used by investing activities in of million was due primarily to a decrease in capital expenditures of million and an increase in proceeds from the sale of oil and gas properties of million  which were offset by an increase in cash used for the acquisitions of oil and gas properties of million 
net cash used by financing activities in of million included the net repayment of bank borrowings of million  offset partially by net proceeds from the issuance of common stock and the exercise of options and warrants of approximately million in the aggregate

dispositions of oil and gas properties as part of our ongoing operations  we routinely dispose of non strategic assets 
assets with marginal value or which are not consistent with our operating strategy are identified for sale or trade 
during  we sold assets  including oil and gas assets with estimated proved reserves of approximately bcfe  for total proceeds of approximately million 
during  we disposed of oil and gas assets with estimated proved reserves of approximately bcfe for total proceeds of approximately million 
credit ratings our senior notes are separately rated by two ratings agencies moody s and s p 
in addition  moody s and s p have assigned forest a general corporate credit rating 
from time to time  our assigned credit ratings may change 
in assigning ratings  the ratings agencies evaluate a number of factors  such as our industry segment  volatility of our industry segment  the geographical mix and diversity of our asset portfolio  the allocation of properties and exploration and drilling activities among short lived and longer lived properties  the need and ability to replace reserves  our cost structure  our debt and capital structure and our general financial condition and prospects 
our bank credit facilities include conditions that are linked to our credit ratings 
the fees and interest rates on our commitments and loans  as well as our collateral obligations  are affected by our credit ratings 
the indentures governing our senior notes do not include adverse triggers that are tied to our credit ratings 
the indentures include terms that will allow us greater flexibility if our credit ratings improve to investment grade and other tests have been satisfied 
in this event  we would have no further obligation to comply with certain restrictive covenants contained in the indentures 
our ability to raise funds and the costs of any financing activities may be affected by our credit rating at the time any such activities are conducted

other liabilities represent current and noncurrent liabilities that are comprised of benefit obligations and asset retirement obligations  for which neither the ultimate settlement amounts nor their timings can be precisely determined in advance 
see critical accounting policies  estimates  and assumptions below for a more detailed discussion of the nature of the accounting estimates involved in estimating asset retirement obligations 
derivative liabilities represent the fair value of liabilities for oil and gas commodity derivatives as of december  the ultimate settlement amounts of our derivative liabilities are unknown  because they are subject to continuing market risk

consists of our net share of budgeted expenditures under authorizations for expenditure afe that were approved by us and our joint venture partners as of december  includes afes for which forest is the operator as well as those operated by others 
in addition to the above commitments  we are obligated to make approximately million of capital expenditures over the next two years pursuant to the terms of foreign concession arrangements 
forest also makes delay rental payments to lessors during the primary terms of oil and gas leases to delay drilling or production of wells  usually for one year 
although we are not obligated to make such payments  discontinuing them would result in the loss of the oil and gas lease 
our total maximum commitment under these leases  through totaled approximately million as of december  off balance sheet arrangements from time to time  we enter into off balance sheet arrangements and transactions that can give rise to off balance sheet obligations 
as of december   the off balance sheet arrangements and transactions that we have entered into include i undrawn letters of credit  ii operating lease agreements  iii drilling commitments  and iv contractual obligations for which the ultimate settlement amounts are not fixed and determinable such as derivative contracts that are sensitive to future changes in commodity prices and gas transportation commitments 
forest does not believe that these arrangements are reasonably likely to materially affect its liquidity or availability of  or requirements for  capital resources 
other obligations we hold a equity interest in an affiliate that owns a petroleum pipeline system within the cook inlet area of alaska 
in our capacity as a shareholder  we have agreed to fund our proportionate share of the operating costs and expenses of this affiliate 
we may have contingent obligations in the event the affiliate experiences cash deficiencies 
in addition  we may have other contingent obligations if the affiliate is unable to meet its indemnification requirements or its obligations to the operator of the pipeline 
we are unable to predict or quantify the amount of these obligations  although we have obtained insurance to mitigate the impacts of certain possible outcomes 
surety bonds in the ordinary course of our business and operations  we are required to post surety bonds from time to time with third parties  including governmental agencies 
as of february   we had obtained surety bonds from a number of insurance and bonding institutions covering certain of our operations in the united states and canada in the aggregate amount of approximately million

critical accounting policies  estimates  judgments  and assumptions critical estimates the following items are estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements that management deems to be critical in nature because either i the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made  and different estimates could have reasonably been used for the accounting estimate in the current period  or ii in our judgment changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period would have a material impact on the presentation of forest s financial condition  changes in financial condition  or results of operations 
oil and gas reserve estimates our estimates of proved reserves are based on the quantities of oil and gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate  with reasonable certainty  to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data  engineering and geological interpretation  and judgment 
for example  we must estimate the amount and timing of future operating costs  production  and property taxes  development costs  and workover costs  all of which may in fact vary considerably from actual results 
in addition  as prices and cost levels change from year to year  the estimate of proved reserves also changes 
any significant variance in these assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of our reserves 
despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates  our reserves are used throughout our financial statements 
for example  since we use the units of production method to amortize our oil and gas properties  the quantity of reserves could significantly impact our dd a expense 
our oil and gas properties are also subject to a ceiling test limitation based in part on the quantity of our proved reserves 
finally  these reserves are the basis for our supplemental oil and gas disclosures 
reference should be made to independent audit of reserves under part i  item business  and estimates of oil and gas reserves are uncertain and inherently imprecise  under part i  item a risk factors  in this form k 
fair values of derivatives the fair market value of all derivative instruments is recognized as an asset or liability on our balance sheet 
the accounting treatment for the changes in fair value is dependent upon whether or not a derivative instrument is i a cash flow hedge or ii a fair value hedge  and upon whether or not the derivative qualifies as an effective hedge 
changes in the fair value of effective cash flow hedges are recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
for fair value hedges  to the extent the hedge is effective there is no effect on the statement of operations  because changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument offset changes in the fair value of the hedged item 
for derivative instruments that do not qualify as fair value hedges or cash flow hedges  changes in fair value are recognized in the consolidated statement of operations as other income or expense 
the estimated fair values of the company s derivative instruments require substantial judgment 
these values are based upon  among other things  future prices  volatility  time to maturity  and credit risk 
the values we report in our financial statements change as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results  changes in market conditions  or other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
another factor that can impact our results of operations each period is our ability to estimate the level of correlation between future changes in the fair value of the hedge instruments and the transactions being hedged  both at the inception and on an ongoing basis 
this correlation is complicated  because energy commodity prices  the primary risk we hedge  have quality and location differences that can be difficult to hedge effectively 
the factors underlying our estimates of fair value and our assessment of correlation of our hedging derivatives are impacted by actual results and changes in conditions that affect these factors  many of which are beyond our control 
due to the volatility of oil and natural gas prices  the fair values of our derivative instruments are subject to large fluctuations in estimated fair value from period to period 
for example  a hypothetical increase or decrease in the forward oil and natural gas prices used to calculate the fair value of the derivative instruments at december  of per barrel and 
per mmbtu  respectively  would change the fair values of our derivative instruments at december  by approximately million 
it has been our experience that commodity prices are subject to large fluctuations  and we expect this volatility to continue 
actual gains or losses recognized in conjunction with our commodity derivative contracts will likely differ from those estimated at december  and will depend exclusively on the price of the commodities on the specified settlement dates provided by the derivative contracts 
valuation of deferred tax assets we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  future income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial statement carrying values and their respective income tax bases temporary differences 
future income tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences are likely to reverse 
the effect on future income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is included in operations in the period in which the change is enacted 
the amount of future income tax assets recognized is limited to the amount of the benefit that is more likely than not to be realized 
in assessing the value of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods for which the deferred tax assets are deductible  management believes it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of these deductible differences  net of the existing valuation allowances at december  the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable  however  could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward periods are reduced 
asset retirement obligations the company has obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore locations at the end of the oil and gas production operations 
forest s removal and restoration obligations are primarily associated with plugging and abandoning wells and removing and disposing of offshore oil and gas platforms in the cook inlet of alaska 
estimating the future restoration and removal costs  or asset retirement obligations  is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments  because most of the obligations are many years in the future  and contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what constitutes removal 
asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing  as are regulatory  political  environmental  safety  and public relations considerations 
inherent in the calculation of the present value of our asset retirement obligations aro under sfas are numerous assumptions and judgments  including the ultimate settlement amounts  inflation factors  credit adjusted discount rates  timing of settlement  and changes in the legal  regulatory  environmental  and political environments 
to the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing aro liability  a corresponding adjustment is made to the oil and gas property balance 
increases in the discounted aro liability resulting from the passage of time are reflected as accretion expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
critical policies the accounting for our business is subject to special accounting rules that are unique to the oil and gas industry 
there are two allowable methods of accounting for oil and gas business activities the full cost method and the successful efforts method 
the differences between the two methods can lead to significant variances in the amounts reported in our financial statements 
we have elected to follow the full cost method  which is described below 
full cost method of accounting under the full cost method  separate cost centers are maintained for each country in which we incur costs 
all costs incurred in the acquisition  exploration  and development of properties including costs of surrendered and abandoned leaseholds  delay lease rentals  dry holes  and overhead related to exploration and development activities are capitalized 
the fair value of estimated future costs of site restoration  dismantlement  and abandonment activities is capitalized  and a corresponding asset retirement obligation liability is recorded 
capitalized costs applicable to each full cost center are depleted using the units of production method based on conversion to common units of measure using one barrel of oil as an equivalent to six thousand cubic feet of natural gas 
changes in estimates of reserves or future development costs are accounted for prospectively in the depletion calculations 
assuming consistent production year over year  our depletion expense will be significantly higher or lower if we significantly decrease or increase our estimates of remaining proved reserves 
investments in unproved properties are not depleted pending the determination of the existence of proved reserves 
unproved properties are assessed periodically to ascertain whether impairment has occurred 
unproved properties whose costs are individually significant are assessed individually by considering the primary lease terms of the properties  the holding period of the properties  and geographic and geologic data obtained relating to the properties 
where it is not practicable to assess individually the amount of impairment of properties for which costs are not individually significant  such properties are grouped for purposes of assessing impairment 
the amount of impairment assessed is added to the costs to be amortized in the appropriate full cost pool  or reported as impairment expense in the consolidated statements of operations  as applicable 
companies that use the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and development activities are required to perform a ceiling test each quarter 
the full cost ceiling test is an impairment test prescribed by sec regulation s x rule the ceiling test is performed each quarter on a country by country basis 
the test determines a limit  or ceiling  on the book value of oil and gas properties 
that limit is basically the after tax present value of the future net cash flows from proved crude oil and natural gas reserves  as adjusted for asset retirement obligations and the effect of cash flow hedges 
this ceiling is compared to the net book value of the oil and gas properties reduced by any related net deferred income tax liability 
if the net book value reduced by the related deferred income taxes exceeds the ceiling  an impairment or non cash writedown is required 
a ceiling test impairment could cause forest to record a significant non cash loss for a particular period  however  future dd a expense would be reduced thereafter 
in countries or areas where the existence of proved reserves has not yet been determined  leasehold costs  seismic costs  and other costs incurred during the exploration phase remain capitalized as unproved property costs until proved reserves have been established or until exploration activities cease 
if exploration activities result in the establishment of proved reserves  amounts are reclassified as proved properties and become subject to depreciation  depletion  and amortization  and the application of the ceiling limitation 
if exploration efforts are unsuccessful in establishing proved reserves and exploration activities cease  the amounts accumulated as unproved costs are charged against earnings as impairments 
under the alternative successful efforts method of accounting  surrendered  abandoned  and impaired leases  delay lease rentals  dry holes  and overhead costs are expensed as incurred 
capitalized costs are depleted on a property by property basis under the successful efforts method 
impairments are assessed on a property by property basis and are charged to expense when assessed 
in general  the application of the full cost method of accounting results in higher capitalized costs and higher depletion rates compared to the successful efforts method 
the full cost method is used to account for our oil and gas exploration and development activities  because we believe it appropriately reports the costs of our exploration programs as part of an overall investment in discovering and developing proved reserves 
impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas r is effective for public companies for interim or annual periods beginning after december   supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values  beginning with the first interim or annual period after december   with early adoption encouraged 
the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no 
will no longer be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
sfas r also requires the tax benefits in excess of recognized compensation expenses to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as currently required 
this requirement may serve to reduce forest s future cash provided by operating activities and increase future cash provided by financing activities  to the extent of associated tax benefits that may be realized in the future 
we are required to adopt sfas r in the first quarter of under sfas r  we must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost  and the transition method to be used at date of adoption 
the transition methods include prospective and retroactive adoption options 
under the retroactive options  prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented 
the prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas r  the retroactive methods would record compensation expense for all unvested stock options and restricted stock beginning with the first period restated 
we have elected to adopt sfas r using the prospective transition method and estimate that we will record approximately million in additional compensation expense in related to unvested outstanding stock options 
this estimate is based on the number of stock options outstanding at december  as well as an estimated overhead capitalization rate of approximately  each of which are subject to change 
forest also has an employee stock purchase plan the espp that allows eligible employees to purchase annually forest s common stock at a discount 
the provisions of sfas r will cause the espp to be accounted for as a compensatory plan 
however  the change in accounting for the espp is not expected to have a material impact on forest s financial position  future results of operations  or liquidity 
historically  the espp compensatory amounts that are required to be recorded under sfas r have been nominal 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk  including the effects of adverse changes in commodity prices  foreign currency exchange rates  and interest rates as discussed below 
commodity price risk we produce and sell natural gas  crude oil  and natural gas liquids for our own account in the united states and canada 
as a result  our financial results are affected when prices for these commodities fluctuate 
such effects can be significant 
hedging program in order to reduce the impact of fluctuations in prices on our revenues  or to protect the economics of property acquisitions  we make use of an oil and gas hedging strategy 
under our hedging strategy  we enter into commodity swaps  collars  and other financial instruments with counterparties who  in general  are participants in our credit facilities 
these arrangements  which are based on prices available in the financial markets at the time the contracts are entered into  are settled in cash and do not require physical deliveries of hydrocarbons 
hedging arrangements covered approximately half of our consolidated production  on an equivalent basis  during each of the years ended december    and we do not enter into derivative instruments for trading purposes 
swaps in a typical commodity swap agreement  we receive the difference between a fixed price per unit of production and a price based on an agreed upon published  third party index if the index price is lower than the fixed price 
if the index price is higher  we pay the difference 
by entering into swap agreements  we effectively fix the price that we will receive in the future for the hedged production 
our current swaps are settled in cash on a monthly basis 
as of december   we had entered into the following swaps swaps natural gas nymex hh oil nymex wti bbtu per day weighted average hedged price per mmbtu fair value in thousands barrels per day weighted average hedged price per bbl fair value in thousands first quarter of   second quarter   third quarter    fourth quarter   in connection with the spin off and subsequent merger transactions completed on march   three natural gas swaps included in the above table covering bbtus per day at an average fixed price of were assigned to and assumed by mariner 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation  above  and note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the spin off 
collars forest also enters into collar agreements with third parties 
a collar agreement is similar to a swap agreement  except that we receive the difference between the floor price and the index price only if the index price is below the floor price  and we pay the difference between the ceiling price and the index price only if the index price is above the ceiling price 
costless collars natural gas nymex hh oil nymex wti bbtu per day weighted average hedged floor and ceiling price per mmbtu fair value in thousands barrels per day weighted average hedged floor and ceiling price per bbl fair value in thousands first quarter of   second quarter   third quarter   fourth quarter   the fair value of our hedges based on the futures prices quoted on december  was a net liability of approximately million 
the following table reconciles the changes that occurred in the fair values of our open derivative contracts during  beginning with the fair value of our commodity contracts on december   less the decrease in fair value during the period and the fair value of commodity contracts acquired in connection with the business combinations  plus the contract losses settled and recognized during the period 
fair value of derivative contracts in thousands unrealized losses on contracts as of december   net decrease in fair value  unrealized loss of acquired contracts  net contract losses recognized  unrealized losses on contracts of as december   long term sales contracts a portion of canadian forest s natural gas production is sold in a joint venture with other producers the canadian netback pool 
the canadian netback pool s resale markets are comprised of market based and fixed price contracts 
canadian forest s contractual obligation to deliver natural gas production volumes to these contracts extends through canadian forest s average daily production sold through the canadian netback pool represented approximately of forest s total average daily production in canadian forest supplied of the canadian netback pool sales quantity in  and it is estimated that canadian forest will supply of the canadian netback pool quantity in the contract year 
we expect that canadian forest s pro rata obligations as a gas producer will increase in and future years 
at december   the weighted average price paid under the resale contracts was approximately of market value based on the closing aeco prices on that date 
to the extent the canadian netback pool s supply is insufficient to meet the delivery obligations under the resale contracts  as is currently the case  the canadian netback pool must make up the shortfall by purchasing spot market gas at prices that currently exceed the prices paid under the resale contracts 
this shortfall could increase if individual producers were to default on their supply obligations owed to the canadian netback pool 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
foreign currency exchange risk we conduct business in several foreign currencies and thus are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk on cash flows related to sales  expenses  financing  and investing transactions 
in the past  we have not entered into any foreign currency forward contracts or other similar financial instruments to manage this risk 
expenditures incurred relative to the foreign concessions held by forest outside of north america have been primarily united states dollar denominated  as have cash proceeds related to property sales and farmout arrangements 
substantially all of our canadian revenues and costs are denominated in canadian dollars 
while the value of the canadian dollar does fluctuate in relation to the us dollar  we believe that any currency risk associated with our canadian operations would not have a material impact on our results of operations 
interest rate risk the following table presents principal amounts and related interest rates by year of maturity for forest s debt obligations at december  total fair value dollar amounts in thousands bank credit facilities variable rate    average interest rate long term debt fixed rate      coupon interest rate effective interest rate as of december  the effective interest rate on the senior notes due  the senior notes due  and the senior notes due is reduced from the coupon rate as a result of amortization of gains related to the termination of related interest rate swaps
