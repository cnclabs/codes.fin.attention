item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and their notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements or as a result of certain factors such as those set forth below under forward looking statements 
general we own a fleet of technologically advanced  new generation osvs  which includes two foreign flagged ahts vessels that primarily operate as supply vessels and for towing jack up rigs 
we also own and operate one fast supply vessel and own two former coastwise sulfur tankers that are being converted into mpsvs 
currently  of our osvs are operating in the us gulf of mexico  or gom  four of our osvs are operating offshore trinidad  and one osv and a fast supply vessel are working offshore mexico 
we also own active ocean going tugs and active ocean going tank barges  six of which are double hulled 
currently  of our tank barges are operating in the northeastern united states  primarily new york harbor  and two are operating in puerto rico 
the current fleet count reflects five double hulled barges delivered in under our first tug and tank barge newbuild program  and is net of the retirement of three single hulled tank barges at the end of we also plan to build several new double hulled tank barges with an aggregate  barrels of additional barrel carrying capacity and  unlike our first tank barge newbuild program  we may construct the related ocean going tugs to be used as power units for the new barges 
all of the new vessels to be constructed under the second tug and tank barge newbuild program are expected to be delivered from early mid through mid upon completion of our second tug and tank barge newbuild program  of our tank barge fleet barrel carrying capacity will be double hulled  up from today and at the end of we charter our osvs on a dayrate basis  under which the customer pays us a specified dollar amount for each day during the term of the contract  pursuant to either fixed term or 
table of contents 
index to financial statements spot time charters 
a fixed term time charter is a contract for a fixed period with a specified dayrate  generally paid monthly 
spot time charters in the osv industry are generally charter contracts with either relatively short fixed or indefinite terms 
in all time charters  spot or fixed  the vessel owner absorbs crew  insurance and repair and maintenance costs in connection with the operation of the vessel  while customers absorb all other direct operating costs 
in addition  in a typical time charter  the charterer obtains the right to direct the movements and utilization of the vessel while the vessel owner retains operational control over the vessel 
all of our osvs and our fast supply vessel operate under time charters  including eleven that are chartered under long term contracts with expiration dates ranging from march through june the long term contracts for our supply vessels are consistent with those used in the industry and are typically either fixed for a term of one or more years or are tied to the duration of a long term contract for a drilling rig for which the vessel provides services 
these contracts generally contain  among others  provisions governing insurance  reciprocal indemnifications  performance requirements and  in certain instances  dayrate escalation terms and renewal options 
while osvs service existing oil and gas production platforms as well as exploration and development activities  incremental osv demand depends primarily upon the level of drilling activity  which can be influenced by a number of factors  including oil and natural gas prices and drilling budgets of exploration and production companies 
as a result  utilization rates have historically been tied to oil and natural gas prices and drilling activity 
however  the relatively large capital commitments  longer lead times and investment horizons associated with deepwater and deep well projects have diminished the significance of these factors compared to conventional shelf projects 
we have developed  through a series of three newbuild programs  a proprietary fleet of   and class new generation osvs to meet the diverse needs of our customers 
through acquisitions  we have broadened the mix of our fleet to include additional class vessels that are well suited for deep shelf gas exploration and other complex shelf drilling applications and to fill the increasing demand for modern equipment for conventional drilling on the continental shelf 
we have continued our efforts to expand the services that we offer our customers with the acquisition of two ahts vessels  which primarily serve as class supply vessels and for towing jack up rigs  the ongoing conversion of two coastwise sulfur tankers for use as class mpsvs  and the commencement of our fourth osv newbuild program that will add  in the aggregate  up to  deadweight tons of capacity to our osv fleet  including up to six edf class vessels that were announced in february although the demand for new generation equipment has historically been driven by deepwater  deep shelf and highly complex projects  we are experiencing increased demand for our vessels for all types of projects  including transition zone and shelf activity  irrespective of water depth  drilling depth or project type  and non oil and gas production activities  including military applications 
notably  this prevailing shift in customer preference does not appear to be limited to the us gulf of mexico  as we have also observed this preference in foreign areas such as mexico  trinidad  brazil and west africa 
soft market conditions for osvs in the us gulf of mexico persisted from the second half of through the first half of since the second half of  osv market conditions in the us gulf of mexico have improved substantially 
our average dayrates have risen 
table of contents 
index to financial statements approximately  since april to an average of approximately  per day for the fourth quarter  while our fleetwide osv utilization has risen from roughly to over the same time span 
this combination of increased dayrates and utilization has resulted in our effective  or utilization adjusted  osv dayrate more than doubling since april market conditions in the us gulf of mexico continue to show positive trends such as the increased level of approved applications to drill deepwater wells and certain operators construction commitments for new deepwater floating rigs  deep shelf jack up rigs  floating production units  subsea tie backs and other deepwater production infrastructure  as well as the additional demand for vessels in connection with rehabilitating infrastructure damaged by hurricanes katrina and rita 
another indication of the encouraging visible demand is rising dayrates and utilization for all classes of offshore rigs  which in the past has been a barometer for osv dayrates 
the supply fundamentals for new generation osvs could further impact market conditions 
the average age of conventional class osvs is approximately years  therefore  we expect that there will be a continued and accelerated attrition rate for such vessels working in the us gulf of mexico and abroad 
although osvs have been recently constructed to replace the worldwide conventional class tonnage being removed from service  several us flagged new generation osvs have left the us gulf of mexico for foreign markets  which is a long term trend that we expect to continue 
additionally  there are signs that the improved market conditions in the us gulf of mexico could be a long term trend 
for example  in the offshore oil and natural gas lease sale during by the minerals management service  interest in acquiring leases was the highest it had been since  a increase from  with of the leases bid on being located in ultra deep water 
generally  we operate an ocean going tug and tank barge together as a tow to transport petroleum products between us ports and along the coast of puerto rico 
we operate our tugs and tank barges under fixed time charters  spot time charters  contracts of affreightment and consecutive voyage contracts 
a fixed term time charter is a contract for a fixed period of time with a specified day rate  generally paid monthly 
spot time charters in the tug and tank barge industry are generally single voyage contracts of affreightment  consecutive voyage contracts  or time charter contracts with either relatively short fixed or indefinite terms 
a consecutive voyage contract is a contract for the transportation of cargo for a specified number of voyages between designated ports over a fixed period of time under which we are paid based on the volume of products we deliver per voyage 
under consecutive voyage contracts  in addition to earning revenues for volumes delivered  we earn a standby hourly rate between voyages 
we may also charter vessels to a third party under a bareboat charter 
a bareboat charter is a net lease in which the charterer takes full operational control over the vessel for a specified period of time for a specified daily rate that is generally paid monthly to the vessel owner 
the bareboat charterer is solely responsible for the operation and management of the vessel and must provide its own crew and pay all operating and voyage expenses 
we also provide tug services to third party vessels on a periodic basis 
typically  these services include vessel docking and towage assistance 
the primary demand drivers for our tug and tank barge services are population growth  the strength of the us economy  changes in weather  oil prices and competition from alternate energy sources 
the tug and tank barge market  in general  is marked by steady demand over time 
results for the first and fourth quarters of a given year are typically higher due to normal seasonal winter weather patterns that typically result in a drop off of activity 
table of contents 
index to financial statements during the second and third quarters 
we generally take advantage of this seasonality to prepare our tug and tank barge fleet for peak demand periods by performing our regulatory drydocking and maintenance programs during the second and third quarters 
in addition  we regularly evaluate our customers needs and often elect to accelerate scheduled drydockings to take advantage of certain market opportunities 
however  as we shift more of our fleet from coas to time charters  some of our historic seasonality will be diminished 
as the most recent major opa milestone approached on january  and since that date  customer demand for double hulled equipment has led to increases in dayrates for this equipment  particularly for tank barges in black oil service 
we are actively working to ensure that our fleet is well positioned to take advantage of these opportunities as they develop 
in november  we commenced our first double hulled tank barge newbuild program to replace some of our existing single hulled tank barges that we anticipated retiring from service in accordance with opa under our first newbuild program  two  barrel double hulled tank barges were placed in service in march and december  respectively  and three  barrel double hulled tank barges were placed in service in july  october and december  respectively 
this newbuild program more than replaced the barrel carrying capacity that we lost when we retired three of our single hulled tank barges from service at the end of  as mandated by opa on september   the company announced a second newbuild program that will add double hulled tank barges with  barrels of aggregate carrying capacity plus related offshore tugs to our existing fleet 
the tugs and double hulled tank barges under the second newbuild program are currently expected to be delivered from mid through mid our operating costs are primarily a function of fleet size and utilization levels 
the most significant direct operating costs are wages paid to vessel crews  maintenance and repairs and marine insurance 
because most of these expenses are incurred regardless of vessel utilization  our direct operating costs as a percentage of revenues may fluctuate considerably with changes in dayrates and utilization 
in addition to the operating costs described above  we incur fixed charges related to the depreciation of our fleet and costs for routine drydock inspections and maintenance and repairs necessary to ensure compliance with applicable regulations and to maintain certifications for our vessels with the us coast guard and various classification societies 
the aggregate number of drydockings and other repairs undertaken in a given period determines the level of maintenance and repair expenses and marine inspection amortization charges 
we generally capitalize costs incurred for drydock inspection and regulatory compliance and amortize such costs over the period between such drydockings  typically or months 
applicable maritime regulations require us to drydock our vessels twice in a five year period for inspection and routine maintenance and repair 
if we undertake a large number of drydockings in a particular fiscal period  comparative results may be affected 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles 
in other circumstances  we are required to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon 
table of contents 
index to financial statements available information 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  the following may involve estimates that are inherently more subjective 
purchase accounting 
purchase accounting requires extensive use of estimates and judgments to allocate the cost of an acquired enterprise to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
the cost of each acquired operation is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values 
these estimates are revised during an allocation period as necessary when  and if  information becomes available to further define and quantify the value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
for example  costs related to the recertification of acquired vessels that are drydocked within the allocation period immediately following the acquisition of such vessels are reflected as an adjustment to the value of the vessels acquired and the liabilities assumed related to the drydocking 
the adjusted basis of the vessel is depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the vessel 
the allocation period does not exceed one year from the date of the acquisition 
to the extent additional information to refine the original allocation becomes available during the allocation period  the allocation of the purchase price is adjusted 
for example  if an acquired vessel was subsequently disposed of within the allocation period  the sales price of the vessel would be used to adjust the original assigned value to the vessel at the date of acquisition such that no gain or loss would be recognized upon disposition during the allocation period 
if information becomes available after the allocation period  those items are reflected in operating results 
carrying value of vessels 
we depreciate our tugs  tank barges  and osvs over estimated useful lives of to years  three to years and to years  respectively 
the useful lives used for single hulled tank barges are based on their classification under opa  and for double hulled tank barges it is years 
in assigning depreciable lives to these assets  we have considered the effects of both physical deterioration largely caused by wear and tear due to operating use and other economic and regulatory factors that could impact commercial viability 
to date  our experience confirms that these policies are reasonable  although there may be events or changes in circumstances in the future that indicate the recoverability of the carrying amount of a vessel might not be possible 
examples of events or changes in circumstances that could indicate that the recoverability of a vessel s carrying amount should be assessed might include a change in regulations such as opa  a significant decrease in the market value of a vessel and current period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with a vessel 
if events or changes in circumstances as set forth above indicate that a vessel s carrying amount may not be recoverable  we would then be required to estimate the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the vessel and its eventual disposition 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the vessel  we would be required to recognize an impairment loss 
recertification costs 
our tugs  tank barges and osvs are required by regulation to be recertified after certain periods of time 
these recertification costs are incurred while the vessel is in drydock where other routine repairs and maintenance are performed and  at times  major replacements and improvements are performed 
we expense routine repairs and 
table of contents 
index to financial statements maintenance as they are incurred 
recertification costs can be accounted for in one of three ways defer and amortize  accrue in advance  or expense as incurred 
companies in our industry typically use either the defer and amortize or the expense as incurred accounting method 
we defer and amortize recertification costs over the length of time that the recertification is expected to last  which is generally or months 
major replacements and improvements  which extend the vessel s economic useful life or functional operating capability  are capitalized and depreciated over the vessel s remaining economic useful life 
inherent in this process are estimates we make regarding the specific cost incurred and the period that the incurred cost will benefit 
revenue recognition 
we charter our osvs to customers under time charters based on a daily rate of hire and recognize revenue as earned on a daily basis during the contract period of the specific vessel 
tugs and tank barges are often contracted to customers under contracts of affreightment  under which revenue is recognized based on the number of days incurred for the voyage as a percentage of total estimated days applied to total estimated revenues 
voyage related costs are expensed as incurred 
substantially all voyages under these contracts are less than days in length 
we also contract our tugs and tank barges under time charters based on a daily rate of hire 
revenue is recognized on such contracts as earned on a daily basis during the contract period of the specific vessel 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
our customers are primarily major and independent  domestic and international  oil and oil service companies 
our customers are granted credit on a short term basis and related credit risks are considered minimal 
we usually do not require collateral 
we provide an estimate for uncollectible accounts based primarily on management s judgment 
management uses historical losses  current economic conditions and individual evaluations of each customer to make adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts 
our historical losses have not been significant 
however  because amounts due from individual customers can be significant  future adjustments to the allowance can be material if one or more individual customers balances are deemed uncollectible 
income taxes 
we follow sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
sfas requires the use of the liability method of computing deferred income taxes 
under this method  deferred income taxes are provided for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the assessment of the realization of deferred tax assets  particularly those related to tax operating loss carryforwards  involves the use of management s judgment to determine whether it is more likely than not that we will realize such tax benefits in the future

operating expense 
our operating expense increased to million in  compared to million in  an increase of million or 
the increase in operating expense during is primarily due to prevailing cost inflation trends in the oilfield and the effect of recent vessel acquisitions and newbuild deliveries  offset in part by mandatory vessel retirements at the end of operating expense for our osv segment increased million  or  to million in  compared to million in operating expenses were higher in due to increased crewing requirements on vessels to meet customer demand  higher insurance costs  and the addition of two ahts vessels to our fleet in january and march operating expense for our tug and tank barge segment was million in  compared to million in  an increase of million or 
operating expenses increased due to higher fuel prices and personnel costs and the addition of two higher horsepower  ocean going tugs and five double hulled newbuild tank barges  offset in part by the effect of the mandatory removal of three single hulled tank barges from service at the end of average daily operating expense in for the tug and tank barge segment is expected to increase as a result of a full year contribution of five double hulled tank barges and two higher horsepower tugs 
depreciation and amortization 
our depreciation and amortization expense of million in increased million or compared to million in this increase is primarily related to increased drydocking activity compared to and the impact of adding two ahts vessels  five double hulled tank barges and two  horsepower ocean going tugs to our fleet  offset in part by the effect of the mandatory removal of three single hulled tank barges from service since these expenses are expected to increase further when the vessels under our recently announced expansion programs are placed in service and when these and any other recently acquired and newly constructed vessels undergo their initial and month recertifications

general and administrative expense 
our general and administrative expense was million for  compared to million in  an increase of million or 
this increase resulted from higher personnel and health insurance costs  including variable incentive compensation commensurate with our record financial results  and costs associated with corporate governance initiatives such as compliance with the sarbanes oxley act 
general and administrative expenses were expected to increase due to our continued growth via vessel acquisitions  our newbuild and conversion programs and our increased reporting obligations under federal securities and corporate governance laws and stock exchange requirements 
however  we expect the ratio of general and administrative expenses to revenues to remain at our historical levels of approximately of revenues 
interest expense

we also recorded deferred taxes due to our federal tax net operating loss carryforwards primarily generated by accelerated depreciation for tax purposes of approximately million as of december  these loss carryforwards are available through to offset future taxable income 
our income tax rate is higher than the federal statutory rate due primarily to expected state and foreign tax liabilities and items not deductible for federal income tax purposes 
liquidity and capital resources our capital requirements have historically been financed with cash flow from operations  proceeds from issuances of our debt and common equity securities  and borrowings under our credit facilities 
we require capital to fund ongoing operations  construction of new vessels  acquisitions  vessel recertifications  discretionary capital expenditures and debt service 
the nature of our capital requirements and the types of our financing sources are not expected to change significantly during we have a five year million senior secured revolving credit facility with a current borrowing base of million 
as of december   we had million of credit immediately available under such facility 
on october   we used a portion of the net proceeds from a public offering of common stock and a concurrent private placement of additional senior notes to pay down our revolving credit facility to a zero balance 
we have made  and may make additional  short term draws on our revolving credit facility from time to time to satisfy scheduled capital expenditure requirements or for other corporate purposes 
any liquidity in excess of our planned capital expenditures will be utilized to repay debt or finance the implementation of our growth strategy  which includes expanding our fleet through the construction of new vessels  conversion or retrofit of existing vessels or acquisition of additional vessels  including osvs  mpsvs  ahts vessels  fast supply vessels  ocean going tugs  tank barges and tankers  as needed to take advantage of the demand for such vessels 
on august and september   respectively  we filed with the commission registration statements on form s and form s in connection with a million universal shelf and a million acquisition shelf 
on september   each of these registration statements was declared effective by the commission 
on october   we closed the private placement of million of additional senior notes that were priced at of principal 
on october   we closed an underwritten public offering of million shares of our common stock at a price to the public of per share  for total gross proceeds to us of million before underwriting discounts  commissions and offering expenses 
this public offering also included an additional million shares sold by a selling stockholder  but we did not receive any proceeds from such sale 
we believe that our current working capital  projected cash flow from operations and available capacity under our revolving credit facility  will be sufficient to meet our cash

index to financial statements requirements for the foreseeable future and  together with the proceeds from the october senior notes and common stock offerings  will fund the recently announced vessel newbuild and conversion programs 
although we expect to continue generating positive working capital through our operations  events beyond our control  such as mild winter conditions  a reduction in domestic consumption of refined petroleum products  or declines in expenditures for exploration  development and production activity may affect our financial condition or results of operations 
depending on the market demand for osvs  tugs and tank barges and other growth opportunities that may arise  we may require additional debt or equity financing 
operating activities 
we rely primarily on cash flows from operations to provide working capital for current and future operations 
cash flows from operating activities totaled million in  million in  and million in the increase in operating cash flows from to was primarily related to substantially improved market conditions in both of our business segments  reduced drydock expenditures  the growth of our fleet and the net effect of the bond refinancing that we commenced in november  which resulted in a lower interest rate and a change in the timing of our interest payments 
our cash flow from operations for the year ended december  reflects a full period of revenue contribution from one osv and one fast supply vessel that were added to our fleet during and partial period contributions from two ahts vessels and five new double hulled tank barges that were placed in service during the decrease in operating cash flows from to was due to increased cash outlays associated with osv drydocking activity and the timing of interest payments resulting from the early extinguishment of debt in november our cash flows from operations are expected to trend higher in  as we will have a full year of revenue contribution from the five new double hulled tank barges and two ahts vessels that were delivered and acquired  respectively  during in  we expect to drydock a total of eleven osvs  five tugs  and six tank barges for recertification and or discretionary vessel enhancements  which together with non vessel capital expenditures related primarily to information technology initiatives  is estimated to cost approximately million 
as of december   we had federal tax net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million available through to offset future federal taxable income 
these federal tax net operating losses were generated primarily through accelerated tax depreciation applied to our vessels 
our use of these tax net operating losses and additional tax benefits may be limited due to us tax laws 
based on the age and composition of our current and projected fleet  we expect to continue generating federal tax net operating losses over the near term 
investing activities 
cash invested for was approximately million  which primarily consisted of construction costs incurred for our first tank barge newbuild program and the acquisitions of two foreign flagged ahts vessels and one coastwise tanker  the latter of which will be retrofitted under the mpsv conversion program described below

in may  we announced a conversion program to retrofit two coastwise sulfur tankers into us flagged  new generation class mpsvs 
the total project cost to acquire and convert the two vessels is currently expected to be at least million in the aggregate 
while we are not yet contractually committed to a shipyard for the costs associated with this conversion program  approximately million has been incurred to date for the purchase of owner furnished equipment  prior to construction period interest 
the remaining conversion costs are expected to be incurred during and we plan to fund the project from current cash on hand and projected cash flow from operations 
we anticipate delivery of the converted vessels during the m v wk mcwilliams  jr  which we acquired in november and renamed the energy service  and the m v benno c

in september  we announced new vessel construction programs for each of our two business segments 
these will be our fourth osv newbuild program and second tug and tank barge newbuild program 
in february  we announced an expansion of our fourth osv newbuild program 
based on internal estimates  the incremental cost of these two programs is expected to be approximately million in the aggregate  prior to the allocation of construction period interest 
our fourth osv newbuild program includes the recently announced four purpose built edf class osvs at an estimated cost of approximately million  in the aggregate 
we are now contractually committed to a gulf coast shipyard for two of the four edf class osvs and a west coast shipyard for the two remaining vessels 
the latter contract includes options for two additional vessels 
this osv newbuild program is expected to create up to an additional  deadweight tons of vessel capacity at an estimated cost of approximately million 
the edf class osvs are expected to be delivered by mid  with the first vessel due in late the precise number of remaining vessels to be constructed under our fourth osv newbuild program  their specifications and expected delivery dates will be finalized as certain milestones are completed  including the negotiation of shipyard contracts 
we also plan to build several new double hulled tank barges with an aggregate  barrels of additional barrel carrying capacity and  unlike our first tank barge newbuild program  we may construct the related ocean going tugs to be used as power units for the new barges 
the estimated incremental cost of the new ocean going tugs and ocean going tank barges is expected to be approximately million  in the aggregate 
we are now contractually committed with one domestic shipyard to build three  barrel barges under the second tug and tank barge newbuild program  of which

for those vessels for which we are not contractually committed to a shipyard  projected timing and pricing are subject to change due to delays and cost overruns inherent in any large construction project  including shortages of equipment  lack of shipyard availability  unforeseen engineering problems  work stoppages  weather interference  unanticipated cost increases  inability to obtain necessary certifications and approvals and shortages of materials or skilled labor

this program is expected to cost  prior to construction period interest  approximately million in the aggregate  of which approximately million was incurred and paid from october through december we expect to incur the remaining balance of million in the first quarter of all five double hulled tank barges under our first tug and tank barge newbuild program were delivered in the two remaining  horsepower tugs under that program are being retrofitted and are expected to be placed in service during the late first quarter of in  we expect to drydock a total of eleven osvs  five tugs  and six tank barges for recertification and or discretionary vessel enhancements  which together with non vessel capital expenditures related primarily to information technology initiatives  is estimated to cost approximately million  which includes approximately million for deferred drydocking charges 
for the year ended december   we expended approximately million for our vessel capital maintenance program  of which million was accounted for as deferred drydocking charges and million for other vessel capital improvements

inflation to date  general inflationary trends have not had a material effect on our operating revenues or expenses 
recent accounting pronouncements on december   the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas r  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  or sfas sfas r supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 or apb  accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas r is similar to the approach described in sfas however  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial condition 
the impact of adoption of sfas r is expected to result in additional compensation expense of approximately million  net of tax  for the fiscal year 
in addition  had we adopted sfas r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note to our audited consolidated financial statements 
sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current gaap literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amount of operating cash flows recognized for such excess tax deductions was approximately million for the year ended december  on april   the commission  announced amended compliance 
table of contents 
index to financial statements dates for sfas r 
the commission previously required companies to adopt this standard no later than july   but the new rule allows companies to implement sfas r at the beginning of their next fiscal year  that begins after june  we will not be required to report under sfas r until the quarter ending march  and do not currently intend to adopt this standard for reporting prior to such time

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have not entered into any derivative financial instrument transactions to manage or reduce market risk or for speculative purposes 
changes in interest rates may result in changes in the fair market value of our financial instruments  interest income and interest expense 
our financial instruments that are exposed to interest rate risk are cash equivalents and long term borrowings 
due to the short duration and conservative nature of our cash equivalent investment portfolio  we do not expect any material loss with respect to our investments 
the book value for cash equivalents is considered to be representative of its fair value 
we are subject to interest rate risk on our long term fixed interest rate senior notes 
in general  the fair market value of debt with a fixed interest rate will increase as interest rates fall 
conversely  the fair market value of debt will decrease as interest rates rise 
the currently outstanding senior notes accrue interest at the rate of per annum and mature on december  and the effective interest rate on such notes is 
our revolving credit facility has a variable interest rate and  therefore  is not subject to interest rate risk 
our operations are primarily conducted between us ports  including along the coast of puerto rico  and historically we have not been exposed to foreign currency fluctuation 
however  as we expand our operations to international markets  we may become exposed to certain risks typically associated with foreign currency fluctuation 
we currently have time charters for four of our osvs for service offshore trinidad 
although such contracts are denominated and will be paid in us dollars  value added tax  or vat  payments are paid in trinidad tobago dollars which creates an exchange risk related to currency fluctuations

to date  we have not hedged against any foreign currency rate fluctuations associated with foreign currency vat payments or other foreign currency denominated transactions arising in the normal course of business 
we continually monitor the currency exchange risks associated with conducting international operations 
to date  gains or losses associated with such fluctuations have not been material
