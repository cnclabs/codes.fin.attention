item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation  below 
types of contracts while the basic terms and conditions of the contracts that we perform may vary considerably  generally we perform our work under two groups of contracts cost reimbursable  and guaranteed maximum and fixed price contracts 
as of december   the following table breaks down the percentage and amount of revenue associated with these types of contracts for our existing backlog backlog in millions cost reimbursable guaranteed maximum and fixed price under cost reimbursable contracts  the client reimburses our costs in developing a project and pays us a pre determined fee or a fee based upon a percentage of the costs incurred in completing the project 
our profit may be in the form of a fee  a simple mark up applied to labor costs incurred in the contract  or a combination of the two 
the fee element may also vary 
the fee may be an incentive fee based upon achieving certain performance factors  milestones or targets  it may be a fixed amount in the contract  or it may be based upon a percentage of the costs incurred 
our government segment  as a prime contractor or a major subcontractor for a number of united states government programs  generally performs its services under cost reimbursable contracts although subject to applicable statutes and regulations 
in many cases  these contracts include incentive fee arrangements 
the programs in question often take many years to complete and may be implemented by the award of many different contracts 
despite the fact that these programs are generally awarded on a multi year basis  the funding for the programs is generally approved on an annual basis by congress 
the government is under no obligation to maintain funding at any specific level  or funds for a program may even be eliminated thereby significantly curtailing or stopping a program 
some of our government contracts are known as indefinite delivery indefinite quantity agreements 
under these arrangements  we work closely with the government to define the scope and amount of work required based upon an estimate of the maximum amount that the government desires to spend 
while the scope is often not initially fully defined or requires any specific amount of work  once the project scope is determined  additional work may be awarded to us without the need for further competitive bidding 
guaranteed maximum price contracts  or gmax contracts  are performed in a manner similar to cost reimbursable contracts except that the total fee plus the total cost cannot exceed an agreed upon guaranteed maximum price 
we can be responsible for some or all of the total cost of the project if the cost exceeds the guaranteed maximum price 
where the total cost is less than the negotiated guaranteed maximum price  we will receive the benefit of the cost savings based upon a negotiated agreement with the client 
fixed price contacts include both negotiated fixed price contracts and lump sum contracts 
under negotiated fixed price contracts  we are selected as contractor first  and then we negotiate price with the client 
these types of contracts generally occur where we commence work before a final price is agreed upon 
under lump sum contracts  we bid on a contract based upon specifications provided by the client against competitors  agreeing to develop a 
table of contents project at a fixed price 
another type of fixed price contract is a so called unit price contract under which we are paid a set amount for every unit of work performed 
in some fixed price contracts  we can benefit from some of the cost savings depending upon whether the client is willing to bear some of the risk if the actual cost exceeds the contract award 
as a result  if we perform well  we can benefit from cost savings  however  if the project does not proceed as originally planned  we cannot recover for cost overruns except in certain limited situations 
competition we are one of the world s larger providers of engineering  procurement and construction services 
the markets served by our business are highly competitive and for the most part require substantial resources  particularly highly skilled and experienced technical personnel 
a large number of companies are competing in the markets served by the business  including us based companies such as the bechtel group  inc  jacobs engineering group  halliburton s kellogg brown root  chicago bridge and iron company nv  chm hill companies limited  parsons engineering group  the shaw group and washington group international  and international companies such as foster wheeler ltd  technip coflexip and amec plc 
in the engineering and construction arena  our competition is primarily centered on performance and the ability to provide the design  engineering  planning  management and project execution skills required to complete complex projects in a safe  timely and cost efficient manner 
our engineering  procurement and construction business derives its competitive strength from our diversity  reputation for quality  technology  cost effectiveness  worldwide procurement capability  project management expertise  geographic coverage and ability to meet client requirements by performing construction on either a union or an open shop basis  ability to execute projects of varying sizes  strong safety record and lengthy experience with a wide range of services and technologies 
the various markets served by the global services segment  while containing some similarities  tend also to have discrete issues particularly impacting that unit 
each of the markets we serve has a large number of companies competing in its markets 
in the equipment sector  which operates in numerous markets  the equipment industry is highly fragmented and very competitive  with most competitors operating in specific geographic areas 
the competition for larger capital project services is more narrow and limited to only those capable of providing comprehensive equipment  tool and management services 
temporary staffing is a highly fragmented market with over  companies competing nationally 
the key competitive factors in this business line are price  service  quality  breadth of service  and the ability to identify and retain qualified personnel and geographical coverage 
the barriers to entry in operations and maintenance are both financially and logistically low with the result that the industry is highly fragmented with no single company being dominant 
competition is generally driven by reputation  price and the capacity to perform 
key competitive factors in our government segment are primarily centered on performance and the ability to provide the design  engineering  planning  management and project execution skills required to complete complex projects in a safe  timely and cost efficient manner 
significant customers for  and  revenues earned directly or indirectly from agencies of the united states federal government accounted for  and  respectively  of our total revenues 
however  we are not dependent on any single federal agency or upon any other single customer on an on going basis  and the loss of any single customer would not have a material adverse effect on our business 
except for the united states federal government  no other single customer accounted for over of our revenues in either of the last two years 
raw materials the principal raw materials we use in our business include structural steel  metal plate and concrete 
these and the other raw materials and the components we use and which are necessary for the conduct of our business are generally available from numerous sources 
we do not foresee any unavailability of raw materials and components that would have a material adverse effect on our business in the near term 
however  the price and availability of these raw materials and components may vary significantly from year to year due to various factors including customer demand  producer capacity  market conditions and material shortages and costs 

table of contents research and development while we engage in research and development efforts in the development of new products and services  during the past three fiscal years  we have not incurred costs for company sponsored research and development activities which would be material  special or unusual in any of our business segments 
patents we hold patents and licenses for certain items that we use in our operations 
however  none is so essential that its loss would materially affect our business 
environmental  safety and health matters we believe  based upon present information available to us  that our accruals with respect to future environmental costs are adequate and any future costs will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
some factors  however could result in additional expenditures or the provision of additional accruals in expectation of such expenditures 
these include the imposition of more stringent requirements under environmental laws or regulations  new developments or changes regarding site cleanup costs or the allocation of such costs among potentially responsible parties  or a determination that we are potentially responsible for the release of hazardous substances at sites other than those currently identified 
number of employees the following table sets forth the number of employees of fluor and its subsidiaries engaged in our continuing business segments as of december  total employees oil gas industrial infrastructure government global services power other total with respect to our total number of employees  as of december  we had  salaried employees and  craft and hourly employees 
the number of craft and hourly employees varies in relation to the number and size of projects we have in process at any particular time

risk factors we bear the risk of cost overruns in approximately of the dollar value of our contracts 
we may experience reduced profits or  in some cases  losses under these contracts if costs increase above our estimates 
we conduct our business under various types of contractual arrangements 
in terms of dollar value  the majority of our contracts allocate the risk of cost overruns to our client by requiring our client to reimburse us for our costs 
approximately of the dollar value of our contracts  however  are guaranteed maximum price or fixed price contracts  where we bear a significant portion of the risk for cost overruns 
under these fixed price contracts  contract prices are established in part on cost and scheduling estimates which are based on a number of assumptions  including assumptions about future economic conditions  prices and availability of labor  equipment and materials  and other exigencies 
if these estimates prove inaccurate  or circumstances change such as unanticipated technical problems  difficulties in obtaining permits or approvals  changes in local laws or labor conditions  weather delays  cost of raw materials  our suppliers or subcontractors inability to perform  cost overruns may occur  and we could experience reduced profits or  in some cases  a loss for that project 
from time to time  we may also assume a project s technical risk  which means that we may have to satisfy certain technical requirements of a project despite the fact that at the time of project award  we may not have previously produced the system or product in question 
our backlog is subject to unexpected adjustments and cancellations and is  therefore  an uncertain indicator of our future earnings 
as of december   our backlog was approximately billion 
we cannot guarantee that the revenues projected in our backlog will be realized or  if realized  will result in profits 
projects may remain in our backlog for an extended period of time 
in addition  project cancellations or scope adjustments may occur  from time to time  with respect to contracts reflected in our backlog 
backlog reductions can adversely affect the revenue and profit we actually receive from contracts reflected in our backlog 
future project cancellations and scope adjustments could further reduce the dollar amount of our backlog and the revenues and profits that we actually receive 
finally  poor project or contract performance could also impact our profits 
if we guarantee the timely completion or performance standards of a project  we could incur additional costs to cover our guarantee obligations 
in some instances and in many of our fixed price contracts  we guarantee a customer that we will complete a project by a scheduled date 
we sometimes provide that the project  when completed  will also achieve certain performance standards 
if we subsequently fail to complete the project as scheduled  or if the project subsequently fails to meet guaranteed performance standards  we may be held responsible for cost impacts to the client resulting from any delay or the costs to cause the project to achieve the performance standards  generally in the form of contractually agreed upon liquidated damages 
to the extent that these events occur  the total costs of the project would exceed our original estimates and we could experience reduced profits or  in some cases  a loss for that project 
the nature of our engineering and construction business exposes us to potential liability claims and contract disputes which may reduce our profits 
we engage in engineering and construction activities for large facilities where design  construction or systems failures can result in substantial injury or damage to third parties 
we have been and may in future be named as a defendant in legal proceedings where parties may make a claim for damages or other remedies with respect to our projects or other matters 
these claims generally arise in the normal course of our business 
when it is determined that we have liability  we may not be covered by insurance or  if covered  the dollar amount of these liabilities may exceed our policy limits 
our professional liability coverage is on a claims made basis covering only claims actually made during the policy period currently in effect 
in addition  even where insurance is maintained for such exposures  the policies have deductibles resulting in our assuming exposure for a layer of coverage with respect to any such claims 
any liability not covered by our insurance  in excess of our insurance limits or  if covered by insurance but subject to a high deductible  could result in a significant loss for us  which claims may reduce our profits and cash available for operations 

table of contents we have seen an increase in our claims against project owners for payment and our failure to recover adequately on these and future claims could have a material effect on us 
we have over the past few years seen an increase in the volume and the amount of claims brought by us against project owners for additional costs exceeding the contract price or for amounts not included in the original contract price 
these types of claims occur due to matters such as owner caused delays or changes from the initial project scope  which result in additional costs  both direct and indirect 
often  these claims can be the subject of lengthy arbitration or litigation proceedings  and it is often difficult to accurately predict when these claims will be fully resolved 
when these types of events occur and unresolved claims are pending  we have used significant working capital in projects to cover cost overruns pending the resolution of the relevant claims 
a failure to promptly recover on these types of claims could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and financial condition 
we are vulnerable to the cyclical nature of the markets we serve 
the demand for our services and products is dependent upon the existence of projects with engineering  procurement  construction and management needs 
although downturns can impact our entire business  our telecommunications and power markets exemplify businesses that are cyclical in nature and have recently been affected by a decrease in worldwide demand for these projects 
industries such as these and many of the others we serve have historically been and will continue to be vulnerable to general downturns and are cyclical in nature 
as a result  our past results have varied considerably and may continue to vary depending upon the demand for future projects in these industries 
our continued success requires us to hire and retain qualified personnel 
over the past year  the demand for employees who engage and are experienced in the services we perform has grown as our customers have increased their capital expenditures and the use of our services 
the success of our business is dependent upon being able to attract and retain personnel  including executive  management and craft employees  who have the necessary and required experience and expertise 
in addition  we are moving our corporate headquarters to irving  texas from southern california in the spring 
while we have asked a large number of employees to relocate to irving  we may suffer some employee losses for those employees who elect not to move which could in turn have an impact on our public company reporting and other corporate activities 
if we cannot find and keep the employees necessary to execute our contracts or to perform necessary corporate activities  it could have a material adverse impact on our business or financial results 
our use of the percentage of completion method of accounting could result in a reduction or reversal of previously recorded revenues or profits 
under our accounting procedures  we measure and recognize a large portion of our profits and revenues under the percentage of completion accounting methodology 
this methodology allows us to recognize revenues and profits ratably over the life of a contract by comparing the amount of the costs incurred to date against the total amount of costs expected to be incurred 
the effect of revisions to revenues and estimated costs is recorded when the amounts are known and can be reasonably estimated  and these revisions can occur at any time and could be material 
on a historical basis  we believe that we have made reasonably reliable estimates of the progress towards completion on our long term contracts 
however  given the uncertainties associated with these types of contracts  it is possible for actual costs to vary from estimates previously made  which may result in reductions or reversals of previously recorded revenues and profits 
we have international operations that are subject to foreign economic and political uncertainties 
unexpected and adverse changes in the foreign countries in which we operate could result in project disruptions  increased costs and potential losses 
our business is subject to fluctuations in demand and to changing domestic and international economic and political conditions which are beyond our control 
as of december   approximately of our projected backlog consisted of engineering and construction revenues to be derived from facilities to be constructed in other 
table of contents countries  we expect that a significant portion of our revenues and profits will continue to come from international projects for the foreseeable future 
operating in the international marketplace exposes us to a number of risks including abrupt changes in foreign government policies and regulations  embargoes  trade restrictions  tax increases  united states government policies  and international hostilities 
the lack of a well developed legal system in some of these countries may make it difficult to enforce our contractual rights 
we also face significant risks due to civil strife  acts of war  terrorism and insurrection 
our level of exposure to these risks will vary with respect to each project  depending on the particular stage of each such project 
for example  our risk exposure with respect to a project in an early development stage will generally be less than our risk exposure with respect to a project in the middle of construction 
to the extent that our international business is affected by unexpected and adverse foreign economic and political conditions  we may experience project disruptions and losses 
project disruptions and losses could significantly reduce our revenues and profits 
our government contracts may be terminated at any time 
also  if we do not comply with restrictions and regulations imposed by the government  our government contracts may be terminated and we may be unable to enter into future government contracts 
the termination of our government contracts could significantly reduce our expected revenues 
we enter into significant government contracts  from time to time  such as those that we have with the us department of energy at fernald and hanford 
government contracts are subject to various uncertainties  restrictions and regulations  including oversight audits by government representatives and profit and cost controls 
government contracts are also exposed to uncertainties associated with congressional funding 
the government is under no obligation to maintain funding at any specific level and funds for a program may even be eliminated 
in addition  government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations and a variety of other socio economic requirements 
for example  we must comply with the federal acquisition regulation far  the truth in negotiations act  the cost accounting standards cas  the service contract act and department of defense security regulations 
we must also comply with various other government regulations and requirements as well as various statutes related to employment practices  environmental protection  recordkeeping and accounting 
if we fail to comply with any of these regulations  requirements or statutes  our existing government contracts could be terminated  and we could be temporarily suspended or even debarred from government contracting or subcontracting 
we also run the risk of the impact of government audits  investigations and proceedings  and so called qui tam actions brought by individuals or the government under the federal false claims act that  if an unfavorable result occurs  could impact our profits and financial condition  as well as our ability to obtain future government work 
for example  government agencies such as the us defense contract audit agency the dcaa routinely review and audit government contractors 
if these agencies determine that a rule or regulation has been violated  a variety of penalties can be imposed including criminal and civil penalties all of which would harm our reputation with the government or even debar us from future government activities 
the dcaa has the ability to review how we have accounted for costs under the far and cas  and if they believe that we have engaged in inappropriate accounting or other activities  payments to us may be disallowed 

table of contents if one or more of our government contracts are terminated for any reason including for convenience  if we are suspended from government contract work  or if payment of our costs is disallowed  we could suffer a significant reduction in expected revenues and profits 
some of our projects and new business may be located in environments where anti corruption initiatives are not followed 
we often perform our projects in countries with less robust legal systems or which are in the developmental stage 
transparency international  an international organization which reviews potential governmental and institutional corruption  has rated many of the countries poorly in terms of their acceptance of corruption and their enforcement of anti corruption laws and rules 
it is the policy of the company to comply with all applicable anti bribery laws such as the foreign corrupt practices act the fcpa of the united states and the applicable laws of all foreign countries in which we operate 
under the fcpa  among other things  us based companies such as fluor and our agents or other intermediaries are precluded from offering anything of value to foreign officials or governments with the intent of obtaining or retaining business  or to otherwise obtain an improper advantage 
we train our staff concerning fcpa issues  and we also inform our partners  subcontractors  agents and others who work for us or on our behalf that they must comply with fcpa requirements 
we also have procedures and controls in place to monitor internal and external compliance 
if we are found to be liable for fcpa violations either due to our own acts or our inadvertence  or due to the acts or inadvertence of others  we could suffer from criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we work in international locations where there are high security risks  which could result in harm to our employees or unanticipated costs 
some of our services are performed in high risk locations  such as iraq  where the country or location is suffering from political  social or economic issues  or war or civil unrest 
in those locations where we have employees or operations  we may incur substantial costs such as security costs to maintain the safety of our personnel 
moreover  despite these activities  in these locations  we cannot guarantee the safety of our personnel 
we continue to expand our business in areas where bonding is required  but bonding capacity is limited 
we continue to expand our business in areas where the underlying contract must be bonded  especially in the transportation infrastructure arena 
because of the overall lack of worldwide bonding capacity  we can find it difficult to find sureties who will provide the contract required bonding 
in addition  these contracts are often very large and extremely complex  which often necessitates the use of a joint venture  often with a competitor  to bid on and perform these types of contracts  especially since it may be easier to jointly pursue the necessary bonding 
however  entering into these types of joint ventures or partnerships exposes us to the credit and performance risks of third parties  many of whom are not as financially strong as we are 
if our joint venturers or partners fail to perform  we could suffer negative results 
it can be very difficult or expensive to obtain the insurance we need for our business operations 
as part of business operations  we maintain insurance both as a corporate risk management strategy and in order to satisfy the requirements of many of our contracts 
insurance products have become increasingly expensive and sometimes very difficult to obtain 
although we have in the past been generally able to cover our insurance needs  there can be no assurances that we can secure all necessary or appropriate insurance in the future 
our international operations expose us to foreign currency fluctuations that could increase our us dollar costs or reduce our us dollar revenues 
because our functional currency is the us dollar  we generally try to denominate our contracts in united states dollars 
however  from time to time our contracts are denominated in foreign currencies  which results in our foreign operations facing the additional risk of fluctuating currency values and exchange rates  hard currency shortages and controls on currency exchange 
changes in the value of foreign currencies could increase our us dollar costs for  or reduce our us dollar revenues from  our foreign operations 
any increased costs or reduced revenues as a result of foreign currency fluctuations could affect our profits 

table of contents intense competition in the engineering and construction industry could reduce our market share and profits 
we serve markets that are highly competitive and in which a large number of multinational companies compete  such as the bechtel group  inc  jacobs engineering group  halliburton s kellogg brown root  chicago bridge and iron company nv  chm hill companies limited  parsons engineering group  the shaw group and washington group international  and international companies such as foster wheeler ltd  technip coflexip and amec plc 
in particular  the engineering and construction markets are highly competitive and require substantial resources and capital investment in equipment  technology and skilled personnel 
competition also places downward pressure on our contract prices and profit margins 
intense competition is expected to continue in these markets  presenting us with significant challenges in our ability to maintain strong growth rates and acceptable profit margins 
if we are unable to meet these competitive challenges  we could lose market share to our competitors and experience an overall reduction in our profits 
the success of our joint ventures depend on the satisfactory performance by our joint venture partners of their joint venture obligations 
the failure of our joint venture partners to perform their joint venture obligations could impose on us additional financial and performance obligations that could result in reduced profits or  in some cases  significant losses for us with respect to the joint venture 
we enter into various joint ventures as part of our engineering  procurement and construction businesses  such as ica fluor and project specific joint ventures 
the success of these and other joint ventures depend  in large part  on the satisfactory performance of our joint venture partners of its joint venture obligations 
if our joint venture partners fail to satisfactorily perform their joint venture obligations as a result of financial or other difficulties  the joint venture may be unable to adequately perform or deliver its contracted services 
under these circumstances  we may be required to make additional investments and provide additional services to ensure the adequate performance and delivery of the contracted services 
these additional obligations could result in reduced profits or  in some cases  significant losses for us with respect to the joint venture 
we may have additional tax liabilities 
we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes 
in the ordinary course of our business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
we are regularly under audit by tax authorities 
although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable  the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation could be materially different than that which is reflected in our financial statements 
in addition  prior to the reverse spin off involving our former coal segment  our predecessor in interest received a ruling from the internal revenue service that the reverse spin off qualified as a tax free spin off under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
the ruling was granted based upon certain representations made by our predecessor in interest 
while we are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would cause those representations to be incorrect or incomplete  if those representations were inaccurate  it is possible that the ruling would no longer be valid 
in such event  we could incur a significant corporate tax liability that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
past and future environmental  safety and health regulations could impose significant additional costs on us that reduce our profits 
we are subject to numerous environmental laws and health and safety regulations 
our projects can involve the handling of hazardous and other highly regulated materials which  if improperly handled or disposed of  could subject us to civil and criminal liabilities 
it is impossible to reliably predict the full nature and effect of judicial  legislative or regulatory developments relating to health and safety regulations and environmental protection regulations applicable to our operations 
the applicable regulations  as well as the technology and length of time available to comply with those regulations  continue to develop and change 
in addition  past activities could also have a material impact on us 
for example  when we sold our mining business formerly conducted through st 
joe minerals corporation  we retained responsibility for certain non lead related environmental liabilities  but only to the extent that such liabilities were not covered by st 
joe s comprehensive general liability insurance 
while we are 
table of contents not currently aware of any material exposure arising from our former st 
joe s business or otherwise  the costs of complying with rulings and regulations or satisfying any environmental remediation requirements for which we are found responsible could be substantial and could reduce our profits 
if we experience delays and or defaults in customer payments  we could suffer liquidity problems or we could be unable to recover all expenditures 
because of the nature of our contracts  at times we commit resources to projects prior to receiving payments from the customer in amounts sufficient to cover expenditures on client projects as they are incurred 
delays in customer payments may require us to make a working capital investment 
if a customer defaults in making its payments on a project in which we have devoted significant resources  it could have a material negative effect on our results of operations 
our recent and any future acquisitions may not be successful 
we expect to continue to pursue selective acquisitions of businesses 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to locate suitable acquisitions or that we will be able to consummate any such transactions on terms and conditions acceptable to us  or that such transactions will be successful 
acquisitions may bring us into businesses we have not previously conducted and expose us to additional business risks that are different than those we have traditionally experienced 
we also may encounter difficulties diligencing or integrating acquisitions and successfully managing the growth we expect to experience from these acquisitions 
in the event we make acquisitions using our stock as consideration  we could dilute share ownership 
as we have announced  we intend to grow our business not only organically but also potentially through acquisitions 
one method of paying for acquisitions or to otherwise fund our corporate initiatives is through the issuance of additional equity securities 
if we do issue additional equity securities  this could have the effect of diluting our earnings per share and shareholders percentage ownership 
delaware law and our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover or change of control 
we are a delaware corporation 
various anti takeover provisions under delaware law impose impediments on the ability of others to acquire control of us  even if a change of control would be beneficial to our stockholders 
in addition  certain provisions of our bylaws may impede or discourage a takeover 
for example our board of directors is divided into three classes serving staggered three year terms  vacancies on the board can only be filled by other directors  there are various restrictions on the ability of a shareholder to nominate a director for election  and our board of directors can authorize the issuance of preference shares 
these types of provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us  even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our shareholders 
accordingly  shareholders may be limited in the ability to obtain a premium for their shares 
as a holding company  we are dependent on our subsidiaries for cash distributions to fund debt payments 
because we are a holding company  we have no true operations or significant assets other than the stock we own of our subsidiaries 
we depend on dividends  loans and other distributions from these subsidiaries for us to be able to pay our debt and other financial obligations 
contractual limitations and legal regulations may restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to make such distributions or loans to us or  if made  may be insufficient to cover our financial obligations  or to pay interest or principal when due on our debt 

table of contents we are dependent upon third parties to complete many of our contracts 
much of the work performed under our contracts is actually performed by third party subcontractors we hire 
we also rely on third party equipment manufacturers or suppliers to provide much of the equipment used for projects 
if we are unable to hire qualified subcontractors or find qualified equipment manufacturers or suppliers  our ability to successfully complete a project could be impaired 
if the amount we are required to pay for subcontractors or equipment and supplies exceeds what we have estimated  especially in a lump sum or a fixed price type contract  we may suffer losses on these contracts 
if a supplier  manufacturer or subcontractor fails to provide supplies  equipment or services as required under a negotiated contract for any reason  we may be required to source these supplies  equipment or services on a delayed basis or at a higher price than anticipated which could impact contract profitability 
we maintain a workforce based upon current and anticipated workloads 
if we do not receive future contract awards or if these awards are delayed  significant costs may result 
our estimates of future performance depend on  among other matters  whether and when we will receive certain new contract awards 
while our estimates are based upon our good faith judgment  these estimates can be unreliable and may frequently change based on newly available information 
in the case of large scale domestic and international projects where timing is often uncertain  it is particularly difficult to predict whether and when we will receive a contract award 
the uncertainty of contract award timing can present difficulties in matching our workforce size with our contract needs 
if an expected contract award is delayed or not received  we could incur costs resulting from reductions in staff or redundancy of facilities that would have the effect of reducing our profits 
systems and information technology interruption could adversely impact our ability to operate 
as a global company  we are heavily reliant on computer  information and communications technology and related systems in order to properly operate 
from time to time  we experience occasional system interruptions and delays 
if we are unable to continually add software and hardware  effectively upgrade our systems and network infrastructure and take other steps to improve the efficiency of and protect our systems  systems operation could be interrupted or delayed 
in addition  our computer and communications systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by natural disasters  power loss  telecommunications failures  acts of war or terrorism  acts of god  computer viruses  physical or electronic break ins and similar events or disruptions 
any of these or other events could cause system interruption  delays and loss of critical data  could delay or prevent operations  and could adversely affect our operating results

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the following discussion and analysis is provided to increase understanding of  and should be read in conjunction with  the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
for purposes of reviewing this document  operating profit is calculated as revenues less cost of revenues excluding corporate administrative and general expense  interest expense  interest income  domestic and foreign income taxes  other non operating income and expense items  earnings or loss from discontinued operations  and the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
results of operations summary of overall company results during  revenue and earnings from continuing operations increased by percent and percent  respectively  compared with all of the company s business segments had higher revenue primarily due to increased project execution activity resulting from strong new award levels over the last three years 
the company believes that the global oil and gas industry is in a long term cycle of investment that will continue to develop over the next several years 
the oil gas and global services segments are benefiting from this trend through improved revenue and operating profit 
also contributing to results in the oil gas segment was the completion of a major refinery upgrader project in venezuela and final settlement of all outstanding claims with the owner s consortium on the project 
this performance was  however  partially offset by an operating loss in the industrial infrastructure segment primarily due to settlements related to projects in the dispute resolution process and cost overruns on several projects 
revenue improved in the government segment due to higher activity in iraq and for support of the federal emergency management agency fema in hurricane relief efforts  however  operating profit was essentially flat primarily due to cost overruns and recognized losses on certain embassy projects for the department of state 
the industrial infrastructure segment recognized losses in on various project related settlements  including two resort hotel projects in the caribbean and two life sciences projects 
in addition  a toll road project being executed by a joint venture in which the company has percent participation  recognized losses in due to further increases in estimated costs 
a loss was also recognized in on this project 
the toll road project has experienced increased costs associated with scope changes requested by the client and other delay related costs 
all of these projects were bid under fixed price or guaranteed maximum commercial terms where the risk of certain variances in cost estimates remain with the company 
during  revenue and earnings from continuing operations increased by percent and percent  respectively  compared with the improvement in revenue was concentrated in the oil gas  government and global services segments 
all segments  with the exception of power  had increases in operating profit in compared with revenue and operating profit in the power segment were substantially lower in compared with due to the decline in new awards due to the cyclical downward trend in the demand for new power plant construction and resulting project completions 
the government segment benefited from increased revenue beginning in the first quarter of from business acquisitions completed in and early during the company recognized an accrual in the amount of million for foreign employment related taxes that may be payable primarily on behalf of certain united states expatriate employees working in certain foreign jurisdictions 
the employment taxes primarily relate to stock based compensation where local tax reporting requirements differ in the method of calculation of taxable amounts from the reporting required in the united states 
the accrual recognizes the aggregate of taxes due on compensation as required to be reported in these foreign jurisdictions 
approximately million of the charge was recognized in the oil gas segment with the majority of the balance recognized in industrial infrastructure and minor amounts in the government and global services segments 
earnings from continuing operations before taxes for the three years ended december  were million in  million in and million in because of the decline in power segment earnings  
table of contents which related largely to projects located in the united states  domestic operating profit has continued to decline during and  offset by increases in operating profits from non us operations 
the decrease in the tax rate compared with is primarily attributable to a favorable audit settlement with the internal revenue service  tax benefit associated with the dividends made pursuant to the american jobs creation act of  and the reversal of certain valuation allowances resulting from the realization of tax benefits associated with such items on the tax returns 
these items include certain net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
in addition  the increased foreign activities of the company during the year also produced increased extraterritorial income exclusion tax benefit 
the company had net earnings of per share in compared with per share in and per share in results in were negatively impacted by a loss from discontinued operations of per share and a loss of per share for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
the results of discontinued operations are further discussed below 
the loss from the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle relates to the adoption of financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
r relating to consolidation of entities that owned certain of the company s leased facilities 
additional discussion of these facilities is contained in the financing obligations footnote in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
for a more detailed discussion of operating performance of each business segment  corporate administrative and general expense and other items  see segment operations and corporate and tax matters below 
discussion of critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
estimates are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  and accordingly  actual results in future periods could differ from these estimates 
significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements apply the following critical accounting policies 
engineering and construction contracts 
engineering and construction contract revenues are recognized on the percentage of completion method based on contract costs incurred to date compared with total estimated contract costs 
this method of revenue recognition requires the company to prepare estimates of costs to complete contracts in progress 
in making such estimates  judgments are required to evaluate contingencies such as potential variances in schedule and the cost of materials  labor costs and productivity  the impact of change orders  liability claims  contract disputes and achievement of contractual performance standards 
changes in total estimated contract costs and losses  if any  are recognized in the period they are determined 
the majority of the company s engineering and construction contracts provide for reimbursement of costs plus a fixed or percentage fee 
in the highly competitive markets served by the company  there is an increasing trend for cost reimbursable contracts with incentive fee arrangements 
as of december   percent of the company s backlog was cost reimbursable while percent was for guaranteed maximum  fixed or unit price contracts 
in certain instances  the company has provided guaranteed completion dates and or achievement of other performance criteria 
failure to meet schedule or performance guarantees  as well as increases in contract costs can result in unrealized incentive fees or non recoverable costs  which could exceed revenues realized from the projects 
claims arising from engineering and construction contracts have been made against the company by clients  and the company has made claims against clients for costs 
the company recognizes certain significant claims for recovery of incurred costs when it is probable that the claim will result in additional contract revenue and when the amount of the claim can be reliably estimated 
recognized claims amounted to million and million at december  and  respectively 
unapproved change orders are accounted for in revenue and cost when it is probable that the costs will be recovered through a change in the contract price 
in circumstances where recovery is considered probable but the revenues cannot be reliably estimated  costs attributable to change orders are deferred pending determination of the impact on contract price 

table of contents backlog in the engineering and construction industry is a measure of the total dollar value of work to be performed on contracts awarded and in progress 
although backlog reflects business that is considered to be firm  cancellations or scope adjustments may occur 
backlog is adjusted to reflect any known project cancellations  deferrals and revised project scope and costs  both upward and downward 
engineering and construction partnerships and joint ventures 
certain contracts are executed jointly through partnerships and joint ventures with unrelated third parties 
the company accounts for its interests in the operations of these ventures on a proportional consolidation basis 
under this method of accounting  the company consolidates its proportional share of venture revenues  costs and operating profits in the consolidated statement of earnings and generally uses the one line equity method of accounting in the consolidated balance sheet 
the most significant application of the proportional consolidation method is in the oil gas  industrial infrastructure and government segments 
the company s accounting for project specific joint venture or consortium arrangements is closely integrated with the accounting for the underlying engineering and construction project for which the joint venture was established 
the company engages in project specific joint venture or consortium arrangements in the ordinary course of business to share risks and or to secure specialty skills required for project execution 
frequently  these arrangements are characterized by a percent or less ownership or participation interest that requires only a small initial investment 
execution of a project is generally the single business purpose of these joint venture arrangements 
when the company is the primary contractor responsible for execution  the project is accounted for as part of normal operations and included in consolidated revenues using appropriate contract accounting principles 
financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
revised  consolidation of variable interest entities fin r provides the principles to consider in determining when variable interest entities must be consolidated in the financial statements of the primary beneficiary 
in general  a variable interest entity is an entity used for business purposes that either a does not have equity investors with voting rights or b has equity investors that are not required to provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities without additional subordinated financial support 
fin r requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
a company that consolidates a variable interest entity is called the primary beneficiary of that entity 
contracts that are executed jointly through partnerships and joint ventures are proportionally consolidated in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue  investor balance sheet and income statement display under the equity method for investments in certain partnerships and other ventures eitf and statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts sop issued by the american institute of certified public accountants 
the company evaluates the applicability of fin r to partnerships and joint ventures at the inception of its participation to ensure its accounting is in accordance with the appropriate standards 
foreign currency 
the company generally limits its exposure to foreign currency fluctuations in most of its engineering and construction contracts through provisions that require client payments in us dollars or other currencies corresponding to the currency in which costs are incurred 
as a result  the company generally does not need to hedge foreign currency cash flows for contract work performed 
under certain limited circumstances  such foreign currency payment provisions could be deemed embedded derivatives 
as of december  and  the company had no significant foreign currency arrangements that constitute embedded derivatives in any of its contracts 
managing foreign currency risk on projects requires estimates of future cash flows and judgments about the timing and distribution of expenditures of foreign currencies 
the company generally uses forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency transactions where contract provisions do not contain foreign currency provisions or the transaction is for a non contract related expenditure 
the objective of this activity is to hedge the foreign exchange currency risk due to changes in exchange rates for currencies in which anticipated future cash payments will be made 
the company does not engage in currency speculation 

table of contents deferred taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or tax returns 
at december  the company had deferred tax assets of million which were partially offset by a valuation allowance of million and further reduced by deferred tax liabilities of million 
the valuation allowance reduces certain deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized 
this allowance primarily relates to the deferred tax assets established for certain net operating and capital loss carryforwards for us and us subsidiaries  and certain reserves on investments 
the company evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets by assessing its valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance  if necessary 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are the company s forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets 
failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in the company s effective tax rate on future earnings 
retirement benefits 
the company accounts for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for pensions  as amended sfas 
as permitted by sfas  changes in retirement plan obligations and assets set aside to pay benefits are not recognized as they occur but are recognized over subsequent periods 
assumptions concerning discount rates  long term rates of return on assets and rates of increase in compensation levels are determined based on the current economic environment in each host country at the end of each respective annual reporting period 
the company evaluates the funded status of each of its retirement plans using these current assumptions and determines the appropriate funding level considering applicable regulatory requirements  tax deductibility  reporting considerations and other factors 
the continuing trend in recent years of low long term interest rates has had the effect of increasing plan liabilities and if expected returns on plan assets are not achieved  future funding obligations could increase substantially 
assuming no changes in current assumptions  the company expects to fund between million and million for the calendar year if the discount rate were reduced by basis points  plan liabilities would increase by approximately million 
share based payment 
the company uses stock based compensation to reward key executives and align their interests with those of shareholders 
types of stock based compensation that have been awarded in recent years include restricted stock  options and stock appreciation rights 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which is a revision of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas r supersedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  and amends sfas  statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas r is similar to the approach described in sfas however  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
upon adoption of sfas r  pro forma disclosure of the impact of share based payments to employees is no longer permitted 
the provisions of sfas r apply to awards granted after the required effective date of the statement  which is no later than january  for the company 
initial application to existing unvested stock option awards may be based on either a modified prospective method or a modified retrospective method 
the method of application selected by the company will determine which  if any  previously reported operating results will be restated 
as permitted by sfas  the company currently accounts for share based payments to employees using the intrinsic value method pursuant to apb and  as such  recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas r s fair value method will have an impact on results of operations  although it will have no impact on overall financial position 
the impact of adoption of sfas r will not be material based on unvested options outstanding at december  had sfas r been adopted in prior periods  the impact would be as presented in the disclosure of pro forma earnings and earnings per share in the consolidated financial statements 
adoption of the new standard will also have an impact on the timing of expense recognition for new stock based awards  as discussed in the consolidated financial statements 
sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as currently required 
this requirement will generally impact cash provided or utilized by operating activities with equal offset in cash flows from financing activities in 
table of contents periods after adoption 
while the company cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amounts of operating cash flows recognized for such excess tax deductions were million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
segment operations the company provides professional services on a global basis in the fields of engineering  procurement  construction and maintenance epcm and is organized into five business segments oil gas  industrial infrastructure  government  global services and power 
the oil gas segment provides engineering  procurement and construction professional services for upstream oil and gas production  downstream refining and certain petrochemical markets 
the industrial infrastructure segment provides engineering  procurement and construction professional services for manufacturing and life sciences facilities  commercial and institutional buildings  mining  microelectronics  telecommunications and transportation projects and other facilities 
the government segment provides project management  engineering  construction  and contingency response services to the united states government 
the global services segment includes operations and maintenance  construction equipment  temporary staffing and global sourcing and procurement services 
the power segment provides professional services to engineer and construct power generation facilities 
oil gas 
in the first quarter of  the chemicals business line  which had been part of the industrial infrastructure segment  was realigned under the oil gas segment 
this change was made to better match the needs for the large number of petrochemical projects anticipated over the next few years with the oil gas segment s large project support infrastructure 
all prior periods have been restated to reflect this change 
commencing in the third quarter of  as the result of a shift in the markets served by and the types of projects awarded to ica fluor daniel ica fluor  its operating results  new awards and backlog are included in the oil gas segment 
ica fluor was previously included in the power segment 
prior periods have not been restated for the change in segment classification of ica fluor 
revenue in the oil gas segment amounted to billion  billion and billion for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the percent increase during and percent increase during resulted from the strength of new contract awards over the past several years due to the higher level of global oil and gas exploration and refining  and also included million in from the hamaca project settlement discussed further below 
operating profit margin in the oil gas segment was percent in compared with percent in and percent in although operating margin was favorably impacted by the million settlement discussed in the following paragraph  margin was reduced by the impact of the million employment tax charge discussed above under summary of overall company results 
during the third quarter of  the company settled all outstanding claims with the owners consortium on the hamaca crude upgrader project in jose  venezuela 
the pending arbitration proceedings have been dismissed 
the settlement reimbursed the company for its incurred costs arising from change orders on the project and for its cost of capital in funding those incurred costs 
the settlement was recorded in revenue and resulted in recognition of million in operating profit in the oil gas segment 
new awards in the oil gas segment were billion in  billion in and billion in the segment is participating in an expanding market that includes very large mega projects in diverse geographical locations  which are very well suited for fluor s global execution and project management capabilities and strong financial position 
new project awards in included billion for two large international petrochemical projects  billion for a gas complex in the united arab emirates and million from a canadian oil sands project 
new project awards in included a million oil sands project and a million clean fuels project  which are both in canada  a million refinery complex modernization project in mexico and a million refinery upgrade project in south africa 
new project awards in include the tengizchevroil tco project  a major oil and gas development in kazakhstan 
backlog for the oil gas segment was billion  up sequentially from billion at december  and billion at december  the growth relates principally to the continued strength of new awards and 
table of contents project scope adjustments to existing projects 
the backlog growth included the impacts of new awards and the reclassification of ica fluor during the year 
total assets in the oil gas segment decreased to million at december  from million at december   reflecting the net impact of the settlement on the hamaca project  partially offset by additional costs associated with the higher level of project execution activities 
total assets in the oil gas segment were million at december  the increase includes the impact of the growth in segment revenues  as well as incurred costs that were deferred on the hamaca project of million 
industrial infrastructure 
as mentioned above  in the first quarter of  the chemicals business line  which had been part of the industrial infrastructure segment  was realigned under the oil gas segment 
again  this change was made to better match the needs for the large number of petrochemical projects anticipated over the next few years with the oil gas segment s large project support infrastructure 
all prior periods have been restated to reflect this change 
the industrial infrastructure segment had revenues of billion  billion and billion for the years ended december   and  respectively 
revenues increased significantly during  primarily as the result of the strength of contract awards 
the percent decline in revenues during resulted from slow start up progress on recently awarded projects and a lower level of new awards in the latter half of in addition  certain projects that were removed from backlog in also had a negative impact on the volume of work performed in the industrial infrastructure segment reported an operating loss of million for  compared with operating profits of million and million for and  respectively 
operating results for the segment have been impacted in all three years by provisions relating to specific projects 
during  a million charge relating to the no liability resolution of a cayman islands project was recorded 
on june   fluor daniel caribbean  inc fd caribbean  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  received an unfavorable jury verdict awarding million to the developer of a resort hotel project in the caribbean 
fd caribbean was the general contractor on the project  which is located in the cayman islands 
as a consequence  the company recorded a million charge in its second quarter to recognize the jury award  estimated attorney fees and pre judgment interest  and reversal of previously billed accounts receivable for work performed on the project 
at the time of the original jury decision  the company strongly believed the verdict was not supported by the facts or by applicable law 
on september   the judge who tried the case granted the company s motion for a new trial  setting aside the unfavorable verdict in its totality 
on september   in lieu of a new trial  the parties stipulated to a judgment of no liability in favor of either side  and the action was dismissed with prejudice 
as a result  the company reversed the provision for the jury award  estimated attorney fees and pre judgment interest in the third quarter of the company participates in a joint venture that is executing a fixed price transportation infrastructure project in california 
the project continues to be subject to circumstances including owner directed scope changes leading to quantity growth  cost escalation  and additional labor  resulting in additional costs due to schedule delays 
the company continues to evaluate the impact of these circumstances on estimated total project costs  as well as claims for recoveries and other contingencies on the project 
during and  provisions of million and million  respectively  were recorded due to these increasing estimated costs 
while the estimate of total project costs is based on the final design including changes directed by the client  any future changes in these estimates will be recognized when identified 
to date  the joint venture has submitted claims totaling approximately million to the client 
costs totaling million have been incurred by the joint venture against these claims as of december  and the company has recognized its million proportionate share of these costs in revenue 
in addition to charges arising from the cayman islands and transportation infrastructure projects discussed above  during the segment recorded provisions totaling approximately million relating to a number of other projects that have been the subject of dispute resolution activities 
project losses recognized in include settlements on a resort hotel project in the bahamas and two life sciences projects 
these projects were bid under 
table of contents fixed price or guaranteed maximum commercial terms where the risk of variances in cost estimates remain with the company 
where the company had determined that costs incurred in excess of the contract price should be the responsibility of the owner  the company made claims against the owners for recovery of costs incurred 
dispute resolution activities have now been concluded on these matters and settlements have been finalized 
several other matters of lesser significance were concluded and incurred costs deemed to be unrecoverable including certain legal fees were recognized in during  operating profit included the recorded provision for the transportation infrastructure project discussed above and a million positive impact from a recovery of insurance proceeds relating to the verde gold project 
in  operating profit was negatively impacted by a million charge relating to the write down of an equity investment in a magnesium smelter project in australia 
the company is involved in arbitration proceedings in connection with its london connect project lul  a million lump sum project to design and install a telecommunications network that allows reception and transmissions throughout the london underground system 
in february  the company sought relief through arbitration proceedings for two issues 
first  the company is seeking relief for the overall delay and disruption to the project that relates to the contract time period of through the arbitration hearing on this matter is scheduled to commence in may in addition  a claim for delay and disruption subsequent to will be submitted to the dispute resolution process shortly 
the total costs incurred amounting to million relating to delay and disruption for the entire contract period have been recognized as claims 
the second issue concerns the responsibility for enabling the various train stock to accept the new telecommunication network equipment 
hearings involving lul  the company and motorola  a subcontractor  are completed and the parties await the arbitration award 
new awards in the industrial infrastructure segment were billion during  following a very strong level of billion in and billion during the lower level of new awards in includes the impact of reduced spending by life sciences customers and the timing of receipt of large mining awards 
new awards in included a variety of mining  life sciences and manufacturing projects throughout the world 
backlog for the industrial infrastructure segment declined to billion at the end of from billion at the end of for  ending backlog was billion 
the decline includes the impact of the lower level of new awards during the year and reductions relating primarily to the cancellations of a number of life sciences projects 
the growth during was reflective of the substantial new awards during the year 
government 
the government segment had revenues of billion  billion and billion for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the percent increase in revenue during resulted principally from fema contracts associated with hurricane relief efforts in certain states bordering the gulf of mexico and an increase in reconstruction activity in iraq 
the percent increase in revenue during resulted principally from reconstruction activity in iraq  strong performance on environmental remediation programs for the department of energy doe  and approximately million from businesses acquired in and del jen  inc del jen was acquired late in the first quarter of and ja jones was acquired in the fourth quarter of in addition  trend western was acquired by del jen in the first quarter of revenue in all three years includes work for ongoing environmental restoration  engineering  construction  site operations and maintenance services at two major doe sites the fernald environmental management project fernald in ohio and the hanford environmental management project in washington 
the operating profit for the government segment during of million  or percent of revenues  was essentially unchanged compared with although operating profit increased due to the year s revenue growth  that improvement was offset by a million charge related to the settlement of a civil lawsuit with the us department of justice and provisions totaling million recognized on four embassy projects 
these embassy projects have been adversely impacted by higher costs due to scope changes  unexpected execution problems  increases in material cost and subcontractor difficulties 
the company has embassy projects that are in various stages of completion under contracts with the united states department of state 
claims for equitable adjustment on seven of these projects totaling approximately million have been identified to date and as of december   million in costs relating to these claims have been incurred and recognized in revenue 
additional claim recoveries continue to be evaluated 

table of contents for the year ended december   operating profit of million  or percent of revenue  compares with million  or percent of revenue  during the earnings growth resulted from strong performance on environmental nuclear projects and from the full year effect of the del jen and trend western acquisitions 
new awards in the government segment were billion during  compared with billion during and billion in during the past two years new awards have increased due to new fema contracts  reconstruction activities in iraq and business acquisitions 
many projects performed on behalf of us government clients under multi year contracts provide for annual funding 
as a result  new awards for the government segment only reflect the annual award of work to be performed over the ensuing months for annually funded contracts 
backlog has remained fairly constant over the past three years  at billion for and billion for and total assets in the government segment increased to million at december   up from million at december  and million at december  the increase was the combined result of significant increases in accounts receivable and contract work in progress relating to fema and iraq reconstruction projects  the embassy claims  and unbilled fees on the fernald project 
the increase related principally to iraq reconstruction projects and unbilled fees on the fernald project 
the segment has recognized unbilled fees totaling million related to the fernald project 
the project has moved into the closeout stage and contract terms provide that a portion of the earned fees will not be billed until project completion in deferred fees recognized in revenue in  and were million  million and million  respectively 
global services 
the global services segment had revenues of billion  billion and billion for the years ended december   and  respectively 
increased operations and maintenance and equipment rental activities have been the primary drivers of these increases 
operating profit margin in the global services segment was percent  percent and percent for the years ended december   and respectively 
the small decline during resulted from a shift in the mix of business among the segment s various service lines 
the decline was the result of lower levels of self perform construction activity and reduced margins resulting from competitive factors in the operations and maintenance business 
the equipment  temporary staffing and global sourcing and procurement operations do not report backlog due to the short turnaround between the receipt of new awards and the recognition of revenue 
accordingly  new awards and backlog for the segment relate to the operations and maintenance activities only 
new awards in the global services segment increased percent  to billion during  and percent  to billion during  from billion during continued growth in the number of client sites served gave rise to these increases 
during  backlog for the global services segment increased by percent  to billion  from billion at the end of backlog increased percent during  from billion at december  this growth was principally the result of the increase in new awards discussed in the preceding paragraph  although a change in scope on a large maintenance contract resulted in the removal of million in materials costs from backlog during total assets in the global services segment increased to million at december   up from million at december  and million at december  these increases were the combined result of significant increases in capital expenditures  accounts receivable and contract work in progress relating to hurricane relief projects and equipment rentals associated with iraq reconstruction contracts 
power 
in july  the company jointly announced with duke energy corporation the decision to terminate the duke fluor daniel partnership d fd as a result of the significant decline in the construction of new power plants 
the dissolution was substantially completed in and did not have a material impact on results of 
table of contents operations or financial position of the company 
the power segment continues to identify and pursue power generation opportunities with its own resources 
commencing in the third quarter of  as the result of a shift in the markets served by and the types of projects awarded to ica fluor  its operating results  new awards and backlog are included in the oil gas segment rather than the power segment where it was previously reported 
prior periods have not been restated for the change in segment classification of ica fluor 
the power segment has reported significantly lower revenue in and  of million and million  respectively  than during  when million was reported 
this decline resulted from the reduced level of construction of new power plants discussed above 
operating profit margin in the power segment declined to percent during from percent during the margin reflects the negative impact of a loss on one project  partly offset by favorable performance on a number of other projects 
the margin reflects performance on projects that were either completed or nearing completion  where profit recognition is strongest and a favorable settlement for a dispute relating to a project that was completed in the favorable results were partly offset by unexpected costs associated with a waste coal power plant start up and commissioning 
operating margin during was a very strong percent  which was attributable to highly successful execution resulting in early completion of a number of projects 
projects in the power segment are often bid and awarded on a fixed price basis 
this method of contracting provides opportunities for margin improvement resulting from successful execution  but also exposes the segment to the risk of cost overruns due to factors such as material cost and labor productivity variances or schedule delays 
new awards in the power segment recovered due to a modest strengthening in the power generation market during and new awards were to billion in and million in  compared with million during new awards in included a contract for the installation of three flue gas desulphurization units at a coal fired power facility in kentucky and a megawatt power plant in nevada 
new awards in included one for the recommissioning of a power plant in south africa and a contract for the completion of a partially constructed natural gas fired plant in nevada
