item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations change in accounting principle  beginning at page below  for a discussion of this change 
fiscal fab impairment charge during the september quarter  we recorded a million asset impairment charge as described below 
during july  we acquired a semiconductor manufacturing facility in puyallup  washington  referred to as fab the original purchase consisted of semiconductor manufacturing facilities and real property 
it was our intention to bring fab to productive readiness and commence volume production of inch wafers using its and micron process technologies by august due to deteriorating business conditions in the semiconductor industry during fiscal  we delayed the intended production start up of fab fab has never been brought to productive readiness 
in august we acquired a semiconductor manufacturing facility in gresham  oregon  referred to as fab after the acquisition of fab was completed  we undertook an analysis of the potential production capacity at fab the results of the production capacity analysis at that time led us to determine that fab s capacity would not be needed in the foreseeable future and during the second quarter of fiscal we committed to a plan to sell fab subsequently  we retained a third party broker to market fab on our behalf and began actively seeking potential buyers 
accordingly  fab was classified as an asset held for sale as of september  and maintained that classification until march  management determined the value assigned to the fab assets through various methods including assistance from a third party appraisal 
the independent third party used the market approach and considered sales of comparable properties in determining the fair value of fab the comparable sales included eight properties  including our purchases of fab in july and fab in august based on the results of this appraisal  we recorded an asset impairment charge on fab of million  including estimated costs to sell 
the remaining value of million was classified as an asset held for sale and was included as a component of other current assets until march  during the quarter ended september   we recorded an asset impairment charge of million to write down certain excess manufacturing equipment located at fab to its net realizable value of million 
this manufacturing equipment became excess as a result of duplicate equipment acquired in the purchase of fab the net realizable value for the excess manufacturing equipment was determined based on management estimates 
substantially all of the other manufacturing equipment located at fab has been transferred to and will be used in our other wafer fabrication facilities located in tempe  arizona fab and gresham  oregon fab 
at march   we changed the classification of fab from an asset held for sale to an asset held for future use 
fab had been on the market for over two years  and we had not received any acceptable offers on the facility 
over that period of time  our business had increased significantly and over the next several years we will need to begin planning for future wafer fabrication capacity as a larger percentage of fab s clean room capacity is utilized 
we determined that the appropriate action to take was to stop actively marketing the fab facility and hold it for its future use 
as a result of this change in classification  we had to assess the fair value of the fab asset to determine if any additional impairment charge was required upon the change in classification from held for sale to held for future use under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
we performed a discounted cash flow analysis of the fab asset based on various financial projections in developing the fair value estimate given that it was the best available valuation technique for the asset 
the discounted cash flow analysis confirmed the carrying value of the fab asset at march  was not in excess of its fair value 
we began to depreciate the fab asset in april powersmart in process research and development charge on june   we completed the acquisition of powersmart  inc in which we acquired all of powersmart s outstanding capital stock and assumed certain stock options for consideration of million in cash plus other acquisition related costs of million 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase business combination in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations  and accordingly  the results of powersmart s operations are included in our consolidated results from the date of the acquisition 
the acquisition was not considered significant under the rules and regulations of the sec rule of regulation s x 
the purchase price was allocated among powersmart s tangible and intangible assets  in process research and development and goodwill 
management determined the value assigned to the assets acquired through various methods including assistance from a third party appraisal 
an allocation of million of the purchase price was assigned to in process research and development and was written off at the date of the acquisition 
the amount paid in excess of the fair value of the net tangible assets was allocated to separately identifiable intangible assets based upon an independent valuation analysis 
an allocation of million of the purchase price was made to core technology and other identifiable intangible assets and is being amortized over an estimated useful life of seven years 
an allocation of approximately million of the purchase price was made to goodwill 
none of the goodwill is deductible for tax purposes 
the goodwill related to the powersmart acquisition was reduced by million to million in the year ended march  due to a favorable settlement of a liability that was recorded as of the original acquisition date
