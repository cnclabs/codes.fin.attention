item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and note business segment information to the consolidated financial statements 
eft processing segment overview our eft processing segment provides outsourcing and network services to banks and mobile phone companies primarily in the developing markets of central and southern europe hungary  poland  the czech republic  croatia  romania  slovakia  albania  serbia and montenegro and greece  africa egypt  uganda and nigeria  india and china  as well as in developed countries of western europe germany and the uk we provide these services either through our euronet owned atms or through contracts under which we operate banks atms 
although all of these markets present market opportunities for expanding the sales of our services  we believe opportunities for transaction growth in the atm services business are greater in the developing countries 
the major source of revenue generated by our atm network is recurring monthly management fees and transaction based revenue 
we receive fixed monthly fees under many of our outsourced management contracts 
this element of revenue has been increasing over the last few years 
revenue sources of the eft processing segment also include pos and card network management revenue and prepaid mobile phone recharge revenue from atm or mobile phone handsets and atm advertising revenue 
the number of atms we operated increased from  at december  to  at december  we monitor the number of transactions made by cardholders on our atm network 
these include cash withdrawals  balance inquiries  deposits  mobile phone airtime recharge purchases and certain denied unauthorized transactions 
we do not bill certain transactions on our network to banks  and we have excluded these transactions for reporting purposes 
the number of transactions processed over our entire atm network has increased over the last five years as indicated in the following table total transactions per year million million million million million the number of transactions processed monthly grew from approximately million in december to approximately million in december our processing centers for the eft processing segment are located in budapest  hungary  mumbai  india  athens  greece  belgrade  serbia and montenegro  and beijing  china 
they are staffed hours a day  seven days a week and consist of production ibm iseries computers  which run the euronet goldnet atm software package 
our significant processing centers in budapest and mumbai both have an off site real time back up iseries computer 
this backup serves to replicate our existing data center and in the event of failure  it would be used to bring up our system using data from our principal processing center 
the processing centers data backup systems are designed to prevent the loss of transaction records due to power failure and permit the orderly shutdown of the switch in an emergency 
our software package is state of the art and conforms to all relevant industry standards 
the processing centers computers operate our atms and interface with banks and international transaction authorization centers  including over host to host connections with banks and card organizations 
our eft processing centers have been certified by a number of transaction exchange entities  such as visa  link and europay mastercard 
eft processing products and services outsourced management solutions euronet offers outsourced management services to banks and other organizations using our processing centers electronic financial transaction processing software 
our outsourced management services include management of existing bank networks of atms  development of new atm networks on a complete turn key basis  management of pos networks  management of credit and debit card databases and other financial processing services 
these services include hour monitoring of each atm s status and cash condition  coordinating the cash delivery and management of cash levels in each atm and providing automatic dispatches for necessary service calls 
we also provide real time transaction authorization  advanced monitoring  network gateway access  network switching  hour customer service  maintenance  and cash settlement  forecasting and reporting 
since our infrastructure is sufficiently robust to support a significant increase in transactions  any new outsourced management services agreements should provide additional revenue with lower incremental cost 
our outsourced management agreements generally provide for fixed monthly management fees and  in most cases  fees payable for each transaction 
the transaction fees under these agreements are generally lower than card acceptance agreements  described below 
euronet branded atm transaction processing euronet has a network of atms in central european countries that are branded as euronet atms 
to manage this atm network  our operations center uses our software solutions segment s integrated transaction management itm core software solution 
the atms in our networks are able to process transactions for holders of credit and debit cards issued by or bearing the logos of banks and international card organizations such as american express  diners club international  visa  mastercard  china union pay and europay organizations 
this ability is accomplished through our agreements and relationships with these banks  international credit and debit card issuers and international associations of card issuers 
in a typical atm transaction  the transaction is routed from the atm to our processing center  and then to the card issuer for authorization 
once authorization is received  the authorization message is routed back to the atm and the transaction is completed 
the card issuer is responsible for authorizing atm transactions processed on our atms 
when a bank cardholder conducts a transaction on a euronet owned atm  we receive a fee from the cardholder s bank for that transaction 
the bank pays us this fee either directly or indirectly through a central switching and settlement network 
when paid indirectly  this fee is referred to as the interchange fee 
all of the banks in a shared atm and pos switching system establish the amount of the interchange fee by agreement 
we receive transaction processing fees for successful transactions and  in certain circumstances  for transactions that are not completed because they fail to receive authorization 
the fees paid to us by the card issuers are independent of any fees charged by the card issuers to cardholders in connection with the atm transactions 
we do not charge cardholders a transaction or access fee for using our atms 
we generally receive fees from our customers for four types of atm transactions cash withdrawals  balance inquiries  transactions not completed because the relevant card issuer does not give authorization  and prepaid telecommunication recharges 
card acceptance or sponsorship agreements our agreements with banks and international card organizations generally provide that all credit and debit cards issued by the customer bank or organization may be used at all atm machines we operate in a given market 
in most markets  we have agreements with a bank under which we are designated as a service provider which we refer to as sponsorship agreements for the acceptance of cards bearing international logos  such as visa and mastercard 
these card acceptance or sponsorship agreements allow us to receive transaction authorization directly from the card issuing bank or international card organization 
our agreements generally provide for a term of three to seven years and are automatically renewed unless either party provides notice of non renewal prior to the termination date 
in some cases  the agreements are terminable by either party upon six months notice 
we are generally able to connect a bank to our network within to days of signing a card acceptance agreement 
generally  the bank provides the cash needed to complete transactions on the atm  although we have contracted for cash supply with a cash supply bank in the czech republic 
under our card acceptance agreements  the atm transaction fees we charge vary depending on the type of transaction and the number of transactions attributable to a particular card issuer 
our agreements generally provide for payment in local currency 
transaction fees are sometimes denominated in us dollars or are adjusted for inflation 
transaction fees are billed to banks and card organizations with payment terms typically no longer than one month 
other products and services our network of owned or operated atms allows for the sale of financial and other products or services at a low incremental cost 
we have developed value added services in addition to basic cash withdrawal and balance inquiry transactions 
these value added services include electronic bill payment  atm advertising and recharge purchasing prepaid airtime from atm and mobile phone devices transactions 
we are committed to the ongoing development of innovative new products and services to offer our eft processing customers and intend to implement additional services as markets develop 
in poland  hungary  croatia  romania  czech republic  uk  egypt  and india  we have established electronic connections to some or all of the major mobile phone operators 
these connections permit us to transmit to them electronic requests to recharge mobile phone accounts 
we have either established or adapted networks of atms in these markets to offer customers of the mobile operators the ability to credit their prepaid mobile phone accounts 
we began to distribute prepaid mobile telephone vouchers on our networks in hungary and poland in november in may and october  we added this service to our czech republic and croatian atm networks  respectively 
in poland  hungary and croatia  we have contracts with all of the local mobile operators 
we include transaction fees payable under the electronic recharge solutions that we distribute through our atms in eft processing segment revenues 
fees for recharge transactions vary substantially from market to market and are based on the specific prepaid solution and the denomination of prepaid usage purchased 
any or all of these fees may come under pricing pressure in the future 
in an automatic atm recharge transaction  our atm prompts a consumer through a series of atm screens  during which the customer s credit or debit card is used to make payment for the recharge transaction 
the card transaction is processed and settled to us in the same fashion as a typical atm transaction 
we then send a signal to the mobile operator requesting credit to the customer s account for the amount of the transaction 
the credit takes place automatically  and the customer receives a message confirming the transaction 
our mobile recharge transaction follows the same pattern  but the transaction occurs with screens directly on the mobile phone 
these recharge transactions are similar to top up transactions in our prepaid processing segment  but since they are transmitted from our atms or mobile phone handsets and proceed through our atm operations center and managed by our atm operations group  they will continue to be reported in the eft processing segment 
our agreements with mobile operators for the atm recharge business vary in term from one to five years 
they provide for the maintenance of the electronic connection necessary to provide recharge transactions to customers and define operational and commercial terms regarding the method by which we will provide that transaction atm and mobile phone  settlement and the liability for transactions processed 
we have expanded our outsourced management solutions beyond atms to include card and pos terminal management and additional services  such as bill payment and prepaid mobile operator solutions 
we support these services using our proprietary software products 
since  we have sold advertising on our network 
clients can display their advertisements on our atm video screens  on the atm receipts and on coupons dispensed with cash from the atms 
eft processing segment strategy we believe banks in both the developing and developed markets are becoming more receptive to outsourcing the operation of their atms  pos and card networks 
the operation of these devices requires expensive hardware and software and specialized personnel 
these resources are available to us and we offer them to banks under outsourcing contracts 
the expansion and enhancement of our outsourced management solutions  in new and existing markets  will remain an important business opportunity for euronet 
increasing the number of bank owned atms that we operate under management agreements should provide continued growth while minimizing the capital we place at risk 
we continually strive to make our own atm networks more efficient by eliminating the underperforming atms and installing atms in more desirable locations 
moreover  we will make selective additions to our own atm network if we see market demand and profit opportunities 
the eft segment s atm and mobile recharge line of services was substantially strengthened through complementary services offered by our prepaid processing segment  where we provide top up services through pos terminals 
we intend to expand our technology and business methods into other markets where we operate and expect to leverage our relationships with mobile operators and banks in those markets to cross sell and to facilitate expansion 
seasonality our business is significantly impacted by seasonality 
we normally experience our highest revenue level during the fourth quarter of each year  followed in order by the second quarter  third quarter and first quarter 
we have estimated that  absent unusual circumstances such as the impact of new acquisitions or unusually high levels of growth due to market factors  the overall revenue realized from our three business segments is likely to be approximately to lower during the first quarter of each year than in the fourth quarter of the year 
we have historically experienced a less than difference between the second and third quarters of each year 
the impact of seasonality has been masked for the last two years due to significant growth rates resulting from the addition of large retail customers in mid fourth quarter  continued shifts from scratch cards to electronic top up and acquisitions 
there can be no assurance that this will be the case for future years 
segment significant customers and government contracts no individual customer makes up greater than of consolidated total revenue and we do not have any government contracts in the eft processing segment 
our outsourcing contracts generally provide for a term of three to seven years and are automatically renewed unless either party provides written notice of non renewal prior to the termination date 
in some cases  the contracts are terminable by either party upon six months notice 
competition our principal eft processing competitors include atm networks owned by banks and national switches consisting of consortiums of local banks that provide outsourcing and transaction services to banks and independent atm deployers in that country 
large  well financed companies that operate atms offer atm network and outsourcing services also compete with us in various markets 
none of these competitors have a dominant market share 
competitive factors in our eft processing segment include network availability and response time  price to both the bank and to its customers  atm location and access to other networks 
certain independent non bank owned companies provide electronic recharge on atms in individual markets in which we provide this service 
we are not aware of any independent companies providing electronic recharge on atms across multiple markets in which we provide this service 
in this area  we believe competition will come principally from banks providing such services on their own atms through relationships with mobile operators or from card transaction switching networks that add recharge transaction capabilities to their offerings as is the case in the uk through the link network 
prepaid processing segment overview we currently offer prepaid mobile phone top up services in the us  europe  africa and asia pacific  money transfer services to customers from the us to destinations in latin america  and bill payment services to customers within the us and poland we are one of the largest providers of prepaid processing  or top up services  for prepaid mobile airtime 
we provide electronic top up services for prepaid mobile airtime primarily in the uk  germany  spain  poland  ireland  australia  new zealand  malaysia  indonesia and the us on a network of more than  pos terminals across more than  retailer locations 
we began reporting the results of this segment in the first quarter after we acquired e pay 
as discussed above  we have continually expanded this business and plan to further expand our top up business in our existing markets and other markets by taking advantage of our existing expertise together with relationships with mobile operators and retailers 
for more details on our prepaid acquisitions  see general overview historical perspective 
in may  we launched our money transfer and bill payment services  euronet payments and remittance  with the acquisition of telecommusa  a licensed money transfer and bill payment company in the us our patented card based money transfer and bill payment system allows transactions to be initiated primarily through pos terminals and integrated cash register systems icr 
transactions can also be initiated through pc  fax or telephone 
we plan to expand our card based money transfer and bill payment services by offering the product on many of our existing pos terminals in the us and internationally 
our processing centers for the prepaid processing segment are located in basildon  uk  munich  germany  monzon and madrid  spain  and leawood  kansas  usa the basildon  madrid and munich processing centers have off site real time backup processing centers that are capable of providing high availability in the event of failure of the primary processing centers 
our processing centers in monzon and the usa have on site backup systems designed to prevent the loss of transaction records due to power failure 
sources of revenue the major source of revenue generated by our prepaid processing segment is commissions or processing fees received from mobile operators and other telecommunications service providers or from distributors of prepaid wireless products for the distributions and or processing of prepaid mobile airtime and other telecommunication products 
revenue sources of the prepaid processing segment also includes revenue earned through the charging of a transaction fee  as well as the difference between purchasing currency at wholesale exchange rates and selling the currency to consumers at retail exchange rates for our money transfer and bill payment services 
we have origination and distribution agents in place for our money transfer services  which each earn a fee for the cash collection and distribution services 
these fees are recognized as direct operating costs at the time of sale 
customers using mobile phones pay for their usage in two ways through postpaid accounts  where usage is billed at the end of each billing period  and through prepaid accounts  where customers pay in advance by crediting their accounts prior to usage 
although mobile operators in the us and certain european countries have provided service principally through postpaid accounts  the trend in most european and other countries offering wireless services has shifted toward prepaid accounts 
this shift is driven  according to ofcom  formerly oftel the uk telecommunications regulator surveys  by customers belief that prepaid products better meet their needs and enable them to better control their monthly wireless expenditures 
moreover  the mobile operators in developing markets favor prepaid because they do not take the credit risk with respect to payment for airtime usage 
in certain developing markets  the majority of mobile phone subscriptions are prepaid 
currently  two principal methods are available to credit prepaid accounts referred to as top up of accounts 
the first is through the purchase of scratch cards bearing a pin personal identification number that  when entered into a customer s mobile phone account  credits the account by the value of airtime purchased 
scratch cards are sold predominantly through retail outlets 
the second is through various electronic means of crediting accounts using pos terminals 
electronic top up or e top up methods have several advantages over scratch cards  primarily because electronic methods do not require the cost of creation  distribution and management of a physical inventory of cards or involve the risk of losses stemming from fraud  theft and mismanagement 
prior to  scratch cards were the predominant method of crediting mobile phone accounts in most developed markets 
however  a shift has occurred in these markets away from usage of scratch cards to more efficient e top up methods 
in the uk  for example  we estimate that in early approximately of all top ups were performed through e top ups and through scratch cards 
by december  we estimate that as much as of all uk top ups in the retail channel were performed through e top ups and only through scratch cards 
this estimation excludes other methods of top up through channels such as atms and or directly with a mobile network operator 
our prepaid processing segment processes the distribution of prepaid mobile phone minutes to consumers through networks of pos terminals and direct connections to the electronic payment systems of retailers 
in some markets  we enter into agreements with mobile phone operators and connect directly to their back office systems 
in other markets such as germany  poland and the us  we distribute mobile phone time by connecting directly to the mobile operators or by purchasing pins that enable airtime top up from third party sources who have negotiated with the mobile operator 
we then distribute the mobile phone time electronically through pos terminals  either via a direct credit from the mobile operator to the mobile phone  or via the sales of pins 
the business has grown rapidly over the past few years as new retailers have been added and prepaid airtime distribution has switched from scratch cards to electronic means 
in our prepaid markets  we expand our distribution networks through the signing of new contracts with retailers  and in some markets  through acquisition of existing networks 
we also seek to improve the results of our existing networks through the addition of new mobile operators in markets where we do not already distribute all of the available prepaid time and the addition of other prepaid products not necessarily related to the mobile operators 
in addition  in the us we are expanding our sales presence in all sales segments 
we are continuing to focus on our growing network of distributors  generally referred to as independent sales organizations isos that are paid a commission for delivering us contracts with retailers in their network to distribute pins from their terminals 
given the role of the isos  we typically classify this as indirect sales 
in addition to indirect sales  we are increasing our focus on direct relationships with independent convenience store retailers and chains  where we can negotiate direct agreements with the merchant on a multiyear basis 
to distribute pins  we establish an electronic connection with the pos terminals and maintain systems that monitor transaction levels at each terminal 
as sales to customers of mobile airtime are completed  the customer pays the retailer and the retailer becomes obligated to make settlement to us of the principal amount of the phone time sold 
we maintain systems that enable us to monitor the payment practices of each retailer 
at e pay  these amounts are deposited in accounts that are held in trust for the mobile operators 
in other countries  retailer accounts are directly debited on a contractually defined basis 
no trust arrangements are required currently in other countries with respect to amounts settled to us 
prepaid processing products and services prepaid mobile airtime transaction processing we process prepaid mobile airtime top up transactions for two types of clients  distributors and retailers  across the us  europe  africa and asia pacific  where we currently process pos transactions through retail shops 
both types of client transactions start with a consumer in a retail shop 
the consumer uses a specially programmed pos terminal in the shop or the retailer s electronic cash register ecr system that is connected to our network to buy prepaid airtime 
the customer will select a predefined amount of prepaid airtime from the carrier of his choice  and the retailer enters the selection into the pos terminal 
the consumer will pay that amount to the retailer in cash or other payment methods accepted by the retailer 
the pos device then transmits the selected transaction to our processing center 
using the electronic connection we maintain with the mobile operator or drawing from our inventory of pins  the purchased amount of airtime will be either credited directly to the account of the consumer s account or delivered via a pin printed by the terminal and given to the customer 
in the case of pins printed by the terminal  the customer must then call a mobile operator s toll free number to activate the purchased airtime to this customer s mobile account 
one difference in our relationships with various retailers and distributors is how we charge for our services 
for distributors and certain very large retailers we charge a processing fee 
however  the majority of our transactions occur with smaller retailer clients 
with these clients  we receive a commission on each transaction that is withheld from the payments made to the mobile operator  and we share that commission with the retailers 
we monitor the number of transactions made on our prepaid networks 
the number of transactions processed on our entire pos network has increased over the last three years as indicated in the following table total transactions per year million million million the number of transactions processed monthly grew from approximately million in december to approximately million in december at more than  pos terminals across more than  retailer locations in the us  europe  africa and asia pacific 
retailer and distributor contracts we provide our prepaid services through pos terminals installed in retail outlets or  in the case of major retailers  through direct connections to their ecr systems  which are connected to our processing centers 
in markets where we operate e pay technology the uk  australia  poland  ireland  new zealand  spain and the us  we own and maintain the pos terminals 
in germany  the terminals are sold to the retailers or to distributors who service the retailer 
in all cases  we have contracts with the retailers 
our agreements with major retailers for the pos services typically have two or three year terms 
these agreements include terms regarding the connection of our networks to the respective retailer s registers or payment terminals or the maintenance of pos terminals  and obligations concerning settlement and liability for transactions processed 
generally  our agreements with individual or small retailers have shorter terms and provide that either party can terminate the agreement upon six months notice 
in germany  distributors have historically controlled the sale of mobile phone scratch cards  and they now are key intermediaries in the sale of e top up 
our business in germany is substantially concentrated in and dependent upon relationships with our major distributors 
the termination of any of our agreements with major distributors could materially and adversely affect our business in germany 
however  we have been establishing agreements with independent retailers in order to diversify our exposure to such distributors 
money transfer and bill payment transaction processing our patented card based money transfer and bill payment system allows transactions to be initiated primarily through pos terminals and integrated cash register systems icr at retail locations 
we currently provide money transfer services from the us to destinations in latin america and bill payment services within the us  where we process pos and icr transactions through retail shops 
both types of transaction services start with a consumer in a retail shop 
the cashier at the retail shop takes the consumer s card and cash to process a money transfer or bill payment transaction 
the cashier swipes the card on a specially programmed pos terminal in the shop or the retailer s icr system that is connected to our network  enters the beneficiary number available on the back of the card  dollar amount of the transaction and finally the cashier s pin number 
the pos device or icr system then transmits the selected transaction to our data center and using our electronic connection we maintain with the retailer we approve the transaction  which enables the cashier to generate two receipts 
the cashier returns the consumer s card and the first receipt and keeps the second one for his records to show the transaction was completed 
it takes approximately seconds to complete a money transfer or bill payment transaction with our patented card based system on the sender s side 
we also started offering bill payment services to our prepaid merchant base in poland  where we process pos transactions through retail shops 
other products and services our pos network can be used for the distribution of other products and services 
although prepaid mobile airtime is the primary product distributed through our prepaid processing segment  additional products include prepaid long distance calling card plans  prepaid internet plans and prepaid mobile content such as ring tones and games 
in certain locations  the terminals used for prepaid services can also be used for electronic funds transfer eft to process credit and debit card payments for retail merchandise 
prepaid processing segment strategy we plan to expand our prepaid mobile phone top up business in our existing markets and new markets by taking advantage of our existing relationships with mobile phone operators and retailers 
although all of these markets present market opportunities for expanding the sales of our services  we believe opportunities for transaction growth in the prepaid processing segment are greater in poland  germany and the us  where there is significant organic growth in the prepaid markets or a shift is occurring from scratch cards to electronic top up 
we also anticipate potential transaction growth opportunities in spain through the addition of certain mobile operator agreements 
growth in our money transfer and bill payment services business will be driven by the continuation of global worker migration patterns  our ability to manage rapid growth  our ability to maximize the opportunity to sell our card based product over our existing pos terminals in the us and internationally  and our ability to obtain licenses to operate in many of the states within the us as well as other countries 
currently focused on the us and latin america market  we plan to expand our money transfer services to other markets 
within the us  we are focusing on increasing our sending locations in existing licensed states by leveraging our access to over  terminals in the us  and obtaining licenses to operate in other key states 
expansion of our money transfer business internationally will require resolution of numerous licensing and regulatory issues in each of the sending markets we intend to develop 
seasonality our business is significantly impacted by seasonality 
we normally experience our highest revenue level during the fourth quarter of each year  followed in order by the second quarter  third quarter and first quarter 
we have estimated that  absent unusual circumstances such as the impact of new acquisitions or unusually high levels of growth due to market factors  the overall revenue realized from our three business segments is likely to be approximately to lower during the first quarter of each year than in the fourth quarter of the year 
we have historically experienced a less than difference between the second and third quarters of each year 
the impact of seasonality has been masked for the last two years due to significant growth rates resulting from the addition of large retail customers in mid fourth quarter  continued shifts from scratch cards to electronic top up and acquisitions 
there can be no assurance that this will be the case for future years 
significant customers and government contracts no individual customer makes up greater than of consolidated total revenue and we do not have any government contracts in any country within the prepaid processing segment 
competition we face competition in the prepaid business in all of our markets 
a few multinational companies operate in several of our markets  and we  therefore  compete with them in a number of countries 
in other markets  our competition is from smaller  local companies 
none of these companies is dominant in any of the markets where we do business 
we believe  however  that we currently have a competitive advantage due to various factors 
first  in the uk  germany and australia  our acquired subsidiaries have been concentrating on the sale of prepaid mobile airtime for longer than most of our competitors and have significant market share in those markets 
we have approximately of the pos recharge market in each of these countries 
in addition  we offer complementary atm and mobile recharge solutions through our eft processing centers 
we believe this will improve our ability to solicit the use of networks of devices owned by third parties for example  banks and switching networks to deliver recharge services 
in selected developing markets  we hope to establish a first to market advantage by rolling out terminals rapidly before competition is established 
we also have an extremely flexible technical platform that enables us to tailor pos solutions to individual merchant and mobile operator requirements where appropriate 
the gprs wireless technology  designed by our transact subsidiary  will also give us an advantage in remote areas where landline phone lines are of lesser quality or nonexistent 
the principal competitive factors in this area include price that is  the level of commission paid to retailers for each recharge transaction  breadth of mobile operator product and up time offered on the system 
major retailers with high volumes are in a position to demand a larger share of the commission  which increases the amount of competition among service providers 
our primary competitors in the money transfer and bill payment business include other independent processors and electronic money transmitters  as well as certain major national and regional banks  financial institutions and independent sales organizations 
our competitors include first data corporation  global payments  moneygram and others who are larger than we are and have greater resources than us 
recently  we are seeing signs that mobile operators may wish to take over and expand their own distribution networks of prepaid time  and in doing so  they may become our competitors 
software solutions segment overview through our software solutions segment  we offer an integrated suite of card and retail transaction delivery applications for the ibm iseries platform and some applications on nt server environments 
these applications are generally referred to as euronet software 
the core system of this product  called integrated transaction management itm  provides for transaction identification  transaction routing  security  transaction detail logging  network connections  authorization interfaces and settlement 
front end systems in this product support atm and pos management  telephone banking  internet banking  mobile banking and event messaging 
these systems provide a comprehensive solution for atm  debit or credit card management and bill payment facilities 
we also offer increased functionality to authorize  switch and settle transactions for multiple banks through our goldnet module 
we use goldnet for our own eft requirements  processing transactions across multiple countries in europe and the asia pacific 
although our software solutions segment is headquartered in the us  the majority of our software customer base is international and  in particular  located in developing markets 
this international customer mix is largely because our software products  based on the itm core system  consist of relatively small and inexpensive packages that are appropriate for smaller banks with up to billion in assets and various transaction processing needs 
euronet software is the preferred transaction processing software for banks that operate their back office using the ibm iseries platform  which is also a relatively inexpensive  expandable hardware platform 
we believe demand will continue for our software from banks in many markets and throughout the developing world as new banks are established 
once a customer purchases our software and installs the core system  we provide a series of modules  upgrades and maintenance services that often result in recurring revenues 
our customer services support follow the sun initiatives  which represent the company s commitment to providing same time zone support for our customers worldwide 
we have three centers covering europe  the middle east and africa emea  the americas  and asia pacific 
this coverage presents several benefits to our customers  including immediate access to live technical support  infrastructure expansion to aid in faster problem resolution and in depth knowledge of the uniqueness of conducting business in the various regions 
software solutions segment strategy software products are an integral part of our product lines  and our investment in research  development  delivery and customer support reflects our ongoing commitment to an expanded customer base 
we have found opportunities for cross selling processing services to our software solutions customers and that our ability to develop  adapt and control our own software gives us credibility with our processing services customers 
we have been able to enter into agreements under which we use our software in lieu of cash as our initial capital contributions to new transaction processing joint ventures 
such contribution permits us to enter new markets without significant cash outlay 
therefore  although revenues from our software solutions segment are not currently growing significantly  we view it as a valuable element of our overall business strategy 
our software is used by our budapest  mumbai  athens  beijing and belgrade processing centers in our eft processing segment  including our euronet middle east jv processing center in bahrain  resulting in cost savings and added value compared to third party license and maintenance options 
our strategy in the software solutions segment in continued to include improvement of the application functionality for our core debit and credit solutions  internet and telephone banking 
additionally  we focused on expanding our point release process significantly 
this process allows existing customers to annually upgrade their systems to current versions of software components  adding new features and functionality and improving the process of installing new products 
our software continues to be upgraded as new compliance mandates from the international card organizations involving initiatives such as emv europay  mastercard and visa chip card support are announced 
in  we realized opportunities to sell emv software to new and existing customers especially in the emea region 
during the last five years  we continued our strategy of signing customers to extended long term software maintenance agreements 
we continue to invest in emerging markets and technologies that complement our processing and software solutions 
seasonality the software solutions segment is not materially affected by seasonality 
significant customers and government contracts no individual consumer makes up greater than of consolidated total revenue and there are no government contracts with any country within the software solutions segment 
backlog we define software sales backlog as fees specified in contracts  which have been executed by us and for which we expect recognition of the related revenue within one year 
at december   the revenue backlog was million  compared to million at december  the average backlog was million in and million for we intend to continue to focus on expediting the delivery and implementation of software in an effort to deliver existing backlog sales  while simultaneously replenishing the backlog through continuing product sales growth 
competition we are the leading supplier of electronic financial transaction processing software for the ibm iseries formerly as platform in a largely fragmented market  which is made up of competitors that offer a variety of solutions that compete with our products  ranging from single applications to fully integrated electronic financial processing software 
other industry suppliers service the software requirements of large mainframe systems and unix based platforms  and accordingly are not considered competitors 
we have specific target customers consisting of financial institutions that operate their back office systems with the ibm iseries 
the software solutions segment has different types of competitors that compete across all eft software components in the following areas i atm  network and pos software systems  ii internet banking software systems  iii credit card software systems  iv mobile banking systems  v mobile operator solutions  vi telephone banking  and vii full eft software 
competitive factors in the software solutions business include price  technology development and the ability of software systems to interact with other leading products 
product research  development and enhancement we have made an ongoing commitment to the maintenance and improvement of our products and services 
we regularly engage in product development and enhancement activities in each of our business segments aimed at the development and delivery of new products  services and processes to our customers  including bill payment and presentment  telephone and internet banking products  applications for mobile devices and wireless banking software products 
we also engage in research and development activities in our software solutions segment to continually improve our core software products 
our research and development costs for software products to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed totaled million in and and million in amounts capitalized were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
amounts capitalized are included on our consolidated balance sheet in other long term assets 
these costs were capitalized under our accounting policy requiring the capitalization of development costs on a product by product basis once technological feasibility is established through the completion of a detailed program design or the creation of a working model of the product 
technological feasibility of computer software products is established when we have completed all planning  designing  coding  and testing activities necessary to establish that the product can be produced to meet its design specifications including functions  features and technical performance requirements 
see note research and development to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed summary of the prior three years research and development capitalized costs and related amortization expense 
financial information by geographic area for a discussion of results from operations  property and equipment  and total assets by geographic location  please see note business segment information to the consolidated financial statements 
employees our business is highly automated and we outsource many specialized  repetitive functions such as atm maintenance and installation  cash delivery and security 
as a result  our labor requirements for ongoing operation of our eft and prepaid networks are relatively modest and are centered on monitoring activities to ensure service quality and cash reconciliation and control 
we also have customer service departments in all divisions to interface  investigate and resolve reported problems in processing transactions 
we have technical service departments to implement new connections with banks and mobile operators and adapt pos terminals to our central processing centers 
we had and employees as of december  and  respectively 
as of december   the number of employees has increased to due to acquisitions and additional administrative and implementation staff to address our large contracts 
we believe our future success will depend in part on our ability to continue to recruit  retain and motivate qualified management  technical and administrative employees 
currently  no union represents any of our employees except in spain  where we have a union sponsored workers representative personnel delegate elected among our staff 
we have never experienced any work stoppages or strikes by our workforce 
government regulation with the exception of our money transfer business  our business activities do not constitute financial activities subject to licensing in any of our current markets 
our money transfer business in the united states is subject to licensing in all of the states where it operates and will be subject to licensing in all foreign markets where it operates 
any expansion of our activity into areas that are qualified as financial activity under local legislation may subject us to licensing and we may be required to comply with various conditions to obtain such licenses 
moreover  the interpretations of bank regulatory authorities as to the activity we currently conduct might change in the future 
we monitor our business for compliance with applicable laws or regulations regarding financial activities 
under german law  only licensed financial institutions may operate atms in germany 
therefore  we may not operate our own atm network in germany without a sponsor 
in that market  we act only as a subcontractor providing certain atm related services to a sponsor bank 
as a result  our activities in the german market currently are entirely dependent upon the continuance of our agreement with our sponsor bank  or the ability to enter into a similar agreement with another bank in the event of the termination of such agreement 
in january  we entered into a new sponsorship agreement with bankhaus august lenz bal canceling an agreement with diba bank  our previous sponsor bank 
we believe  based on our experience  we should be able to find a replacement for bal if the agreement with bal is terminated for any reason 
the inability to maintain the bal agreement or to enter into a similar agreement with another bank upon a termination of the bal agreement could have a material adverse effect on our operations in germany 
for further information  see item a risk factors we are required under german law and the rules of financial transaction switching networks in all of our markets to have sponsors to operate atms and switch atm transactions 
our failure to secure sponsor arrangements in any market could prevent us from doing business in that market 
intellectual property we have registered or applied for registration of our trademarks including the names euronet and bankomat and or the blue diamond logo in most markets in which we use those trademarks 
certain trademark authorities have notified us that they consider these trademarks to be generic and therefore not protected by trademark laws 
this determination does not affect our ability to use the euronet trademark in those markets but it would prevent us from stopping other parties from using it in competition with euronet 
we have purchased a registration of the euronet trademark in the class of atm machines in germany  the uk and certain other western european countries 
we have registered the e pay logo trademark in the uk and australia and will be extending such registration as we expand that business to new markets 
we cannot be sure that we will be entitled to use the e pay trademark in any markets other than those in which we have registered the trademark 
other trademarks euronet has registered or has registrations pending in various countries include integrated transaction management  itm  payspot  arksys  cashnet  bank and bank access additionally  through the acquisition of telecommusa  a money transfer and bill payment business  we acquired telecommusa s patented card based money transfer and bill payment system that allows transactions to be initiated primarily through pos terminals and integrated cash register systems 
during and  we filed patent applications for a number of our new software products and our new processing technology  including our recharge services and a browser based atm operating system 
in  we filed a patent application with the us patent office for our pos recharge products in support of e pay and payspot technology 
as of the date of this report  these patents are still pending 
technology in the areas in which we operate is developing very rapidly and we are aware that many other companies have filed patent applications for similar products 
the procedures of the us patent office make it impossible for us to predict whether our patent applications will be approved or will be granted priority dates that are earlier than other patents that have been filed for similar products or services 
if other applicants are granted priority dates that are earlier than ours  and if their patents are considered to cover technology that has been incorporated into our systems  we may be required to obtain licenses and pay royalties to the holders of such patents to continue to use the affected technology or be prohibited from continuing the offering of such services if licenses are not obtained 
this could materially and adversely affect our business

item a 
risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our company 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occurs  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
in that case  the trading price of our common stock could decline substantially 
this annual report also contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors  including the risks described below and elsewhere in this annual report 
risks related to our business we have a substantial amount of debt and other contractual commitments  and the cost of servicing those obligations could adversely affect our business  and such risk could increase if we incur more debt 
we have a substantial amount of indebtedness 
as of december   our total liabilities were million and our total assets were million 
in addition  we estimate that we will have to pay approximately million to million during the years through as deferred consideration in connection with the movilcarga and dynamic telecom acquisitions 
a portion of these obligations may be paid in stock 
while we expect to satisfy any payment obligations from available cash and operating cash flows  we may not have sufficient funds to satisfy all such obligations as a result of a variety of factors  some of which may be beyond our control 
if the opportunity of a strategic acquisition arises or if we enter into new contracts that require the installation or servicing of atm machines on a faster pace than anticipated  we may be required to incur additional debt for these purposes and to fund our working capital needs  which we may not be able to obtain 
the level of our indebtedness could have important consequences to investors  including the following our ability to obtain any necessary financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service requirements or other purposes may be limited or financing may be unavailable  a substantial portion of our cash flows must be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness and other obligations and will not be available for use in our business  our level of indebtedness could limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the markets in which we operate  our high degree of indebtedness will make us more vulnerable to changes in general economic conditions and or a downturn in our business  thereby making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations  and because a portion of our indebtedness and other obligations are denominated in other currencies  and because a portion of our debt bears interest at a variable rate of interest  our actual debt service obligations could increase as a result of adverse changes in currency exchange and interest rates 
if we fail to make required debt payments  or if we fail to comply with other covenants in our debt service agreements  we would be in default under the terms of these agreements 
this default would permit the holders of the indebtedness to accelerate repayment of this debt and could cause defaults under other indebtedness that we have 
although we have reported net income in recent periods  our concentration on expansion of our business in the future may significantly impact our ability to continue to report net income 
during the period from january  through december   we reported a net loss in each of these fiscal years  primarily attributable to our investments for the expansion of our business 
we believe these investments have recently started to produce positive results for us  as evidenced by our reporting of net income of approximately million and million fiscal years ended december  and  respectively 
we may experience operating losses again in the future while we continue to concentrate on expansion of our business and increasing our market share 
restrictive covenants in our credit facilities may adversely affect us 
our credit facilities contain a variety of restrictive covenants that limit our ability to incur debt  make investments  pay dividends and sell assets 
in addition  these facilities require us to maintain specified financial ratios as defined  including debt to ebitda and ebitdar to fixed charges  and satisfy other financial condition tests  including a minimum ebitda test 
see description of credit facility 
our ability to meet those financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control  and we cannot assure you that we will meet those tests 
a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our credit facilities 
upon the occurrence of an event of default under our credit facilities  the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the credit facilities to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit 
if we were unable to repay those amounts  the lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness 
we have pledged a substantial portion of our assets as security under the credit facilities 
if the lenders under either credit facility accelerate the repayment of borrowings  we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to repay our credit facilities and our other indebtedness 
our business may suffer from risks related to our recent acquisitions and potential future acquisitions 
a substantial portion of our recent growth is due to acquisitions  and we continue to evaluate and engage in discussions concerning potential acquisition opportunities  some of which could be material 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to consummate such future transactions 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully integrate  or otherwise realize anticipated benefits from  our recent acquisitions or any future acquisitions  which could adversely impact our long term competitiveness and profitability 
the integration of our recent acquisitions and any future acquisitions will involve a number of risks that could harm our financial condition  results of operations and competitive position 
in particular the integration plan for our acquisitions assumes benefits based on analyses that involve assumptions as to future events  including leveraging our existing relationships with mobile phone operators and retailers  as well as general business and industry conditions  many of which are beyond our control and may not materialize 
unforeseen factors may offset components of our integration plan in whole or in part 
as a result  our actual results may vary considerably  or be considerably delayed  compared to our estimates  the integration process could disrupt the activities of the businesses that are being combined 
the combination of companies requires  among other things  coordination of administrative and other functions 
in addition  the loss of key employees  customers or vendors of acquired businesses could materially and adversely impact the integration of the acquired business  the execution of our integration plans may divert the attention of our management from operating our business  we may assume unanticipated liabilities and contingencies  or our acquisition targets could fail to perform in accordance with our expectations at the time of purchase 
future acquisitions may be affected through the issuance of our common stock  or securities convertible into our common stock  which could substantially dilute the ownership percentage of our current stockholders 
in addition  shares issued in connection with future acquisitions could be publicly tradable  which could result in a material decrease in the market price of our common stock 
a lack of business opportunities or financial or other resources may impede our ability to continue to expand at desired levels  and our failure to expand operations could have an adverse impact on our financial condition 
our expansion plans and opportunities are focused on four separate areas i our network of owned and operated atms  ii outsourced atm management contracts  iii our prepaid mobile airtime services  and iv our money transfer and bill payment services 
the continued expansion and development of our atm business will depend on various factors including the following the demand for our atm services in our current target markets  the ability to locate appropriate atm sites and obtain necessary approvals for the installation of atms  the ability to install atms in an efficient and timely manner  the expansion of our business into new countries as currently planned  entering into additional card acceptance and atm management agreements with banks  the ability to obtain sufficient numbers of atms on a timely basis  and the availability of financing for the expansion 
we carefully monitor the growth of our atm networks in each of our markets  and we accelerate or delay our expansion plans depending on local market conditions  such as variations in the transaction fees we receive  competition  overall trends in atm transaction levels and performance of individual atms 
we cannot predict the increase or decrease in the number of atms we manage under outsourcing agreements  because this depends largely on the willingness of banks to enter into outsourcing contracts with us 
banks are very deliberate in negotiating these agreements and the process of negotiating and signing outsourcing agreements typically takes six to twelve months or longer 
moreover  banks evaluate a wide range of matters when deciding to choose an outsource vendor and generally this decision is subject to extensive management analysis and approvals 
the process is exacerbated by the legal and regulatory considerations of local countries  as well as local language complexities 
these agreements tend to cover large numbers of atms  so significant increases and decreases in our pool of managed atms could result from signature or termination of these management contracts 
in this regard  the timing of both current and new contract revenues is uncertain and unpredictable 
increasing consolidation in the banking industry could make this process less predictable 
we currently offer prepaid mobile airtime top up services in the us  europe  africa and asia pacific and we currently offer money transfer services from the us to latin america and bill payment services within the us we plan to expand these services in these and other markets by taking advantage of our existing relationships with mobile phone operators  banks and retailers 
this expansion will depend on various factors  including the following the ability to negotiate new agreements in these markets with mobile phone operators  banks and retailers  the continuation of the trend of increased use of electronic prepaid mobile airtime among mobile phone users  the continuation of the trend of increased use of electronic money transfer and bill payment among immigrant workers  the development of mobile phone networks in these markets and the increase in the number of mobile phone users  and the availability of financing for the expansion 
in addition  our continued expansion may involve acquisitions that could divert our resources and management time and require integration of new assets with our existing networks and services and could require financing that we may not be able to obtain 
our ability to manage our rapid expansion effectively will require us eventually to expand our operating systems and employee base 
an inability to do this could have a material adverse effect on our business  growth  financial condition or results of operations 
we are subject to business cycles and other outside factors that may negatively affect mobile phone operators  retailers and our customers 
a recessionary economic environment or other outside factors could have a negative impact on mobile phone operators  retailers and our customers and could reduce the level of transactions  which could  in turn  negatively impact our financial results 
if mobile phone operators experience decreased demand for their prepaid products and services including due to increasing usage of postpaid services or if the retail locations where we provide pos top up services decrease in number  we will process fewer transactions  resulting in lower revenue 
in addition  a recessionary economic environment could result in a higher rate of bankruptcy filings by mobile phone operators  retailers and our customers and could reduce the level of atm transactions  which will have a negative impact on our business 
the growth of our prepaid business is dependent on certain factors that vary from market to market but may reduce or eliminate growth in fully mature markets 
growth in our prepaid business in any given market is driven by a number of factors  including the extent to which conversion from scratch cards to electronic distribution solutions is occurring or has been completed  the overall pace of growth in the prepaid mobile telephone market  our market share of the retail distribution capacity and the level of commission that is paid to the various intermediaries in the prepaid mobile airtime distribution chain 
in mature markets  such as the uk  australia and ireland  the conversion from scratch cards to electronic forms of distribution is either complete or nearing completion 
therefore  these factors will cease to provide the organic increases in the number of transactions per terminal that we have experienced historically 
also in mature markets  competition among prepaid distributors results in the reduction of commissions and margins by mobile operators as well as retailer churn 
the combined impact of these factors in fully mature markets is a flattening of growth in the revenues and profits that we earn in these markets 
these factors could adversely impact our financial results as the markets in which we conduct the prepaid business mature 
our prepaid mobile airtime top up business may be susceptible to fraud occurring at the retailer level 
in our prepaid processing segment  we contract with retailers that accept payment on our behalf  which we then transfer to a trust or other operating account for payment to mobile phone operators 
in the event a retailer does not transfer to us payments that it receives for mobile airtime  we are responsible to the mobile phone operator for the cost of the airtime credited to the customer s mobile phone 
although  in certain circumstances  we maintain credit enhancement insurance polices and take other precautions to mitigate this risk  we can provide no assurance that retailer fraud will not increase in the future or that any proceeds we receive under our insurance policies will be adequate to cover losses resulting from retailer fraud  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
because we typically enter into short term contracts with mobile phone operators and retailers  our top up business is subject to the risk of non renewal of those contracts 
our contracts with mobile phone operators to process prepaid mobile airtime recharge services typically have terms of two to three years or less 
many of those contracts may be canceled by either party upon three months notice 
our contracts with mobile phone operators are not exclusive  so these operators may enter into top up contracts with other service providers 
in addition  our top up service contracts with major retailers typically have terms of one to two years and our contracts with smaller retailers typically may be canceled by either party upon three months notice 
the cancellation or non renewal of one or more of our significant mobile phone operator or retail contracts  or of a large enough group of our contracts with smaller retailers  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  our contracts generally permit operators to reduce our fees at any time 
commission revenue or fee reductions by any of the mobile phone operators could also have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in the us and certain other countries  processes and systems we employ may be subject to patent protection by other parties 
in the us and certain other countries  patent protection legislation permits the protection of processes and systems 
we employ certain processes and systems in various markets that have been used in the industry by other parties for many years  and which we or other companies that use the same or similar processes and systems consider to be in the public domain 
however  we are aware that certain parties believe they hold patents that cover some of the processes and systems employed in the prepaid processing industry in the us and elsewhere 
we believe the processes and systems we use have been in the public domain prior to patents we are aware of 
the question whether a process or system is in the public domain is a legal determination  and if this issue is litigated we cannot be certain of the outcome of any such litigation 
if a person were to assert that it holds a patent covering any of the processes or systems we use  we would be required to defend ourselves against such claim 
if unsuccessful  we may be required to pay damages for past infringement which could be trebled if the infringement was found to be willful 
we may also be required to seek a license to continue to use the processes or systems 
such a license may require either a single payment or an ongoing license fee 
no assurance can be given that we will be able to obtain a license which is reasonable in amount and scope 
if a patent owner is unwilling to grant such a license  or we decide not to obtain such a license  we may be required to modify our processes and systems to avoid future infringement 
any such occurrences could materially and adversely affect our prepaid processing business in any affected markets and could result in our reconsidering the rate of expansion of this business in those markets 
the level of transactions on our atm and prepaid processing networks is subject to substantial seasonal variation  which may cause our quarterly results to fluctuate materially and create volatility in the price of our shares 
our experience is that the level of transactions on our networks is subject to substantial seasonal variation 
transaction levels have consistently been much higher in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year due to increased use of atms and prepaid mobile airtime top ups during the holiday season 
the level of transactions drops in the first quarter  during which transaction levels are generally the lowest we experience during the year 
since revenues of the eft processing and prepaid processing segments are primarily transaction based  these segments are directly affected by this seasonality 
as a result of these seasonal variations  our quarterly operating results may fluctuate materially and could lead to volatility in the price of our shares 
the stability and growth of our atm business depend on maintaining our current card acceptance and atm management agreements with banks and international card organizations  and on securing new arrangements for card acceptance and atm management 
the stability and future growth of our atm business depend in part on our ability to sign card acceptance and atm management agreements with banks and international card organizations 
card acceptance agreements allow our atms to accept credit and debit cards issued by banks and international card organizations 
atm management agreements generate service income from our management of atms for banks 
these agreements are the primary source of our atm business 
these agreements have expiration dates and banks and international card organizations are generally not obligated to renew them 
in some cases  banks may terminate their contracts prior to the expiration of their terms 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to sign or maintain these agreements on terms and conditions acceptable to us or whether those international card organizations will continue to permit our atms to accept their credit and debit cards 
the inability to continue to sign or maintain these agreements  or to continue to accept the credit and debit cards of local banks and international card organizations at our atms in the future  could have a material adverse effect on our business  growth  financial condition or results of operations 
retaining the founders of our company  and of companies that we acquire  and finding and retaining qualified personnel in europe may be important to our continued success 
our strategy and its implementation depend in large part on the founders of our company  in particular michael brown and daniel henry  and their continued involvement in euronet in the future 
in addition  the success of the expansion of businesses that we acquire may depend in large part upon the retention of the founders of those businesses 
our success also depends in part on our ability to hire and retain highly skilled and qualified management  operating  marketing  financial and technical personnel 
the competition for qualified personnel in central europe and the other markets where we conduct our business is intense and  accordingly  we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to hire or retain the required personnel 
our officers and some of our key personnel have entered into service or employment agreements containing non competition  non disclosure and non solicitation covenants and providing for the granting of incentive stock options with long term vesting requirements 
however  most of these contracts do not guarantee that these individuals will continue their employment with us 
the loss of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business  growth  financial condition or results of operations 
our operating results depend in part on the volume of transactions on atms in our network and the fees we can collect from processing these transactions 
transaction fees from banks and international card organizations for transactions processed on our atms have historically accounted for a substantial majority of our revenues 
these fees are set by agreement among all banks in a particular market 
although we are less dependent on these fees due to our prepaid processing segment  the future operating results of our atm business depend on the following factors the increased issuance of credit and debit cards  the increased acceptance of our atm processing and management services in our target markets  the maintenance of the level of transaction fees we receive  the installation of larger numbers of atms  and the continued use of our atms by credit and debit cardholders 
although we believe that the volume of transactions in developing countries will tend to increase due to growth in the number of cards being issued by banks in these markets  we anticipate that transaction levels on any given atm in developing markets will not increase significantly 
we can improve the levels of transactions on our atm network overall by acquiring good sites for our atms  eliminating poor locations  entering new less developed markets and adding new transactions to the sets of transactions that are available on our atms 
however  we may not be successful in materially increasing transaction levels through these measures 
per transaction fees have declined in certain markets in recent years 
if we cannot continue to increase our transaction levels and per transaction fees generally decline  our results would be adversely affected 
our operating results depend in part on the volume of transactions for prepaid phone services and the commissions we receive for these services 
our prepaid processing segment derives revenues based on processing fees and commissions from mobile and other telecommunication operators or distributors of prepaid wireless products 
generally  these operators have the right to reduce the overall fee paid for each transaction  although a portion of such reductions can be passed along to retailers 
in the last year  processing fees and commissions per transaction have been declining in most markets  and we expect that trend to continue 
we have been able to improve our results despite that trend due to substantial growth in transactions  driven by acquisitions and organic growth 
we do not expect to continue this rate of growth 
if we cannot continue to increase our transaction levels and per transaction fees and commissions continue to decline  our results would be adversely affected 
our operating results in the money transfer business depend in part on continued worker immigration patterns  our ability to expand our share of the existing electronic market and to expand into new markets and our ability to continue complying with regulations issued by the office of foreign assets control ofac  bank secrecy act bsa  financial crimes enforcement network fincen and patriot act regulations 
our money transfer business primarily focuses on customers who immigrate to the united states from latin american countries in search of employment and then send a portion of their earnings to family members in latin america 
our ability to continue complying with the requirements of ofac  bsa  fincen and the patriot act will be important to our success in achieving growth and an inability to do this could have an adverse impact on our revenue and earnings 
changes in federal policies toward immigration may have a negative affect on immigration in the us  which could also have an adverse impact on our money transfer revenues 
future growth and profitability depend upon expansion within the markets in which we currently operate and the development of new markets for our money transfer services 
to achieve this expansion  we plan to initially focus on growth in the us and latin america market by increasing our sending locations in existing states and then expanding into other states by leveraging our prepaid processing terminal base 
expansion of our money transfer business to other states in the us and internationally will require resolution of numerous licensing and regulatory issues in each of the sending markets we intend to develop 
if we are unable to successfully apply the money transfer product to our existing terminal base or obtain the necessary licensing and other regulatory approvals  we may not realize expected results 
our expansion into new markets is also dependent upon our ability to apply our existing technology or to develop new applications to satisfy market demand 
we may not have adequate financial and technological resources to expand our distribution channels and product applications to satisfy these demands  which may have an adverse impact on our ability to achieve expected growth in revenues and earnings 
changes in state  federal or foreign laws  rules and regulations could impact the money transfer industry making it more difficult for our customers to initiate money transfers 
we are subject to regulation by the us states in which we operate  by the federal government and by the foreign governments of the countries in which we operate 
changes in the laws  rules and regulations or these governmental entities could adversely impact our money transfer business and make it more difficult for our customers to initiate money transfers 
this could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flow 
changes in banking industry regulation and practice could make it more difficult for us and our agents to maintain depository accounts with banks 
the banking industry  in light of increased regulatory oversight  is continually examining its business relationships with companies who offer money transfer services and with retail agents who collect and remit cash collected from end consumers 
should banks decide to not offer depository services to companies engaged in processing money transfer transactions  or to retail agents who collect and remit cash from end customers  our ability to administer and collect fees from money transfer transactions could be adversely impacted 
developments in electronic financial transactions  such as the increased use of debit cards by customers and pass through of atm transaction fees by banks to customers or developments in the mobile phone industry  could materially reduce atm transaction levels and our revenues 
certain developments in the field of electronic financial transactions may reduce the amount of cash that individuals need on a daily basis  including the promotion by international card organizations and banks of the use of bank debit cards for transactions of small amounts 
these developments may reduce the transaction levels that we experience on our atms in the markets where they occur 
banks also could elect to pass through to their customers all  or a large part of  the fees we charge for transactions on our atms 
this would increase the cost of using our atm machines to the banks customers  which may cause a decline in the use of our atm machines and  thus  have an adverse effect on our revenues 
if transaction levels over our existing atm network do not increase  growth in our revenues from the atms we own will depend primarily on rolling out atms at new sites and developing new markets  which requires capital investment and resources and reduces the margin we realize from our revenues 
the mobile phone industry is a rapidly evolving area  in which technological developments  in particular the development of new methods or services  may affect the demand for other services in a dramatic way 
the development of any new technology that reduces the need or demand for prepaid mobile phone time could materially and adversely affect our business 
we generally have little control over the atm transaction fees established in the markets where we operate  and therefore cannot control any potential reductions in these fees 
the amount of fees we receive per transaction is set in various ways in the markets in which we do business 
we have card acceptance agreements or atm management agreements with some banks under which fees are set 
however  we derive the bulk of our revenues in most markets from interchange fees that are set by the central atm processing switch 
the banks that participate in these switches set the interchange fee  and we are not in a position in any market to greatly influence these fees  which may increase or decrease over time 
a significant decrease in the interchange fee in any market could adversely affect our results in that market 
in some cases  we are dependent upon international card organizations and national transaction processing switches to provide assistance in obtaining settlement from card issuers of funds relating to transactions on our atms 
our atms dispense cash relating to transactions on credit and debit cards issued by banks 
we have in place arrangements for the settlement to us of all of those transactions  but in some cases we do not have a direct relationship with the card issuing bank and rely for settlement on the application of rules that are administered by international card associations such as visa or mastercard or national transaction processing switching networks 
if a bankcard association fails to settle transactions in accordance with those rules  we are dependent upon cooperation from such organizations or switching networks to enforce our right of settlement against such banks or card associations 
failure by such organizations or switches to provide the required cooperation could result in our inability to obtain settlement of funds relating to transactions and adversely affect our business 
we derive a significant amount of revenue in our business from service agreements signed with financial institutions to own and or operate their atm machines 
certain contracts have been and  in the future  may be terminated by the financial institution resulting in a substantial reduction in revenue 
contract termination payments  if any  may be inadequate to replace revenues and operating income associated with these contracts 
because our business is highly dependent on the proper operation of our computer network and telecommunications connections  significant technical disruptions to these systems would adversely affect our revenues and financial results 
our business involves the operation and maintenance of a sophisticated computer network and telecommunications connections with banks  financial institutions  mobile operators and retailers 
this  in turn  requires the maintenance of computer equipment and infrastructure  including telecommunications and electrical systems  and the integration and enhancement of complex software applications 
our atm segment also uses a satellite based system that is susceptible to the risk of satellite failure 
there are operational risks inherent in this type of business that can result in the temporary shutdown of part or all of our processing systems  such as failure of electrical supply  failure of computer hardware and software errors 
excluding germany  transactions in the eft processing segment are processed through our budapest  belgrade  athens  beijing and mumbai operations centers 
our e top up transactions are processed through our basildon  munich  monzon  madrid and leawood  kansas operations centers 
our us money transfer and bill payment transactions are contracted through a charlotte  north carolina third party processing center 
any operational problem in these centers may have a significant adverse impact on the operation of our networks generally 
to mitigate these risks  our significant processing centers in budapest  basildon  madrid  and munich have off site real time backup processing centers that are capable of providing high availability in the event of failure of the primary processing centers 
our processing centers in mumbai  monzon  athens  belgrade and the us have on site backup systems designed to prevent the loss of transaction records due to power failure 
even with disaster recovery procedures in place  these risks cannot be eliminated entirely and any technical failure that prevents operation of our systems for a significant period of time will prevent us from processing transactions during that period of time and will directly and adversely affect our revenues and financial results 
we have the risk of liability for fraudulent bankcard and other card transactions involving a breach in our security systems  as well as for atm theft and vandalism 
we capture  transmit  handle and store sensitive information in conducting and managing electronic  financial and mobile transactions  such as card information and pin numbers 
these businesses involve certain inherent security risks  in particular the risk of electronic interception and theft of the information for use in fraudulent or other card transactions  by persons outside the company or by our own employees 
we incorporate industry standard encryption technology and processing methodology into our systems and software  and maintain controls and procedures regarding access to our computer systems by employees and others  to maintain high levels of security 
although this technology and methodology decrease security risks  they cannot be eliminated entirely  as criminal elements apply increasingly sophisticated technology to attempt to obtain unauthorized access to the information handled by atm and electronic financial transaction networks 
any breach in our security systems could result in the perpetration of fraudulent financial transactions for which we may be found liable 
we are insured against various risks  including theft and negligence  but such insurance coverage is subject to deductibles  exclusions and limitations that may leave us bearing some or all of any losses arising from security breaches 
in addition to electronic fraud issues  the possible theft and vandalism of atms present risks for our atm business 
we install atms at high traffic sites and consequently our atms are exposed to theft and vandalism 
although we are insured against such risks  deductibles  exclusions or limitations in such insurance may leave us bearing some or all of any losses arising from theft or vandalism of atms 
in addition  we have experienced increases in claims under our insurance  which has increased our insurance premiums 
we are required under german law and the rules of financial transaction switching networks in all of our markets to have sponsors to operate atms and switch atm transactions 
our failure to secure sponsor arrangements in germany or any other market could prevent us from doing business in that market 
under german law  only a licensed financial institution may operate atms 
because we are not a licensed financial institution we are required to have a sponsor bank to conduct our german atm operations 
in addition  in all of our markets  our atms are connected to national financial transaction switching networks owned or operated by banks  and to other international financial transaction switching networks operated by organizations such as citibank  visa and mastercard 
the rules governing these switching networks require any company sending transactions through these switches to be a bank or a technical service processor that is approved and monitored by a bank 
as a result  the operation of our atm network in all of our markets depends on our ability to secure these sponsor arrangements with financial institutions 
to date  we have been successful in reaching contractual arrangements that have permitted us to operate in all of our target markets 
however  we cannot assure you that we will continue to be successful in reaching these arrangements  and it is possible that our current arrangements will not continue to be renewed 
if we are unable to secure sponsor arrangements in germany or any other market  we could be prevented from doing business in the applicable market 
our competition in the eft processing segment and prepaid processing segment include large  well financed companies and banks and  in the software market  companies larger than us with earlier entry into the market 
as a result  we may lack the financial resources and access needed to capture increased market share 
eft processing segment our principal eft processing competitors include atm networks owned by banks and national switches consisting of consortiums of local banks that provide outsourcing and transaction services only to banks and independent atm deployers in that country 
large  well financed companies that operate atms offer atm network and outsourcing services that compete with us in various markets 
none of these competitors have dominant market share 
competitive factors in our eft processing segment include network availability and response time  price to both the bank and to its customers  atm location and access to other networks 
certain independent non bank owned companies provide electronic recharge on atms in individual markets in which we provide this service 
we are not aware of any individual independent companies providing electronic recharge on atms across multiple markets in which we provide this service 
in this area  we believe competition will come principally from the banks providing such services on their own atms through relationships with mobile operators or from card transaction switching networks that add recharge transaction capabilities to their offerings as is the case in the uk through the link network 
prepaid processing segment we face competition in the prepaid business in all of our markets 
a few multinational companies operate in several of our markets  and we therefore compete with them in a number of countries 
in other markets  our competition is from smaller  local companies 
the principal competitive factors in this area include price that is  the level of commission charged for each recharge transaction and up time offered on the system 
major retailers with high volumes are in a position to demand a larger share of the commission  which increases the amount of competition among service providers 
our primary competitors in the money transfer and bill payment business include other independent processors and electronic money transmitters  as well as certain major national and regional banks  financial institutions and independent sales organizations 
our competitors include first data corporation  global payments  moneygram and others who are larger than we are and have greater resources than we have 
this may allow them to offer better pricing terms to customers  which may result in a loss of our potential or current customers or could force us to lower our prices 
either of these actions could have an adverse impact on our revenues 
in addition  our competitors may have the ability to devote more financial and operational resources than we can to the development of new technologies that provide improved functionality and features to their product and service offerings 
if successful  their development efforts could render our product and services offerings less desirable  resulting in the loss of customers or a reduction in the price we could demand for our services 
software solutions segment we believe we are the leading supplier of electronic financial transaction processing software for the ibm iseries formerly as platform in a largely fragmented market  which is made up of competitors that offer a variety of solutions that compete with our products  ranging from single applications to fully integrated electronic financial processing software 
other industry suppliers service the software requirements of large mainframe systems and unix based platforms  and accordingly are not considered competitors 
we have specific target customers consisting of financial institutions that operate their back office systems with the ibm iseries 
the software solutions segment has multiple types of competitors that compete across all eft software components in the following areas i atm  network and pos software systems  ii internet banking software systems  iii credit card software systems  iv mobile banking systems  v mobile operator solutions  vi telephone banking  and vii full eft software 
competitive factors in the software solutions business include price  technology development and the ability of software systems to interact with other leading products 
we conduct a significant portion of our business in central and eastern european countries  and we have subsidiaries in the middle east and asia  where the risk of continued political  economic and regulatory change that could impact our operating results is greater than in the us or western europe 
we have subsidiaries in hungary  poland  the czech republic  romania  slovakia  spain  greece  croatia  india  serbia  bulgaria  russia  egypt and china  and have operations in other countries in central europe  the middle east and asia 
we expect to continue to expand our operations to other countries in these areas 
we sell software in many other markets in the developing world 
some of these countries have undergone significant political  economic and social change in recent years and the risk of new  unforeseen changes in these countries remains greater than in the us or western europe 
in particular  changes in laws or regulations or in the interpretation of existing laws or regulations  whether caused by a change in government or otherwise  could materially adversely affect our business  growth  financial condition or results of operations 
for example  currently there are no limitations on the repatriation of profits from any of the countries in which we have subsidiaries although us tax laws discourage repatriation  but foreign currency exchange control restrictions  taxes or limitations may be imposed or increased in the future with regard to repatriation of earnings and investments from these countries 
if exchange control restrictions  taxes or limitations are imposed  our ability to receive dividends or other payments from affected subsidiaries could be reduced  which may have a material adverse effect on us 
in addition  corporate  contract  property  insolvency  competition  securities and other laws and regulations in hungary  poland  the czech republic  romania  slovakia  croatia  bulgaria  russia and other countries in central europe have been  and continue to be  substantially revised during the completion of their transition to the european union 
therefore  the interpretation and procedural safeguards of the new legal and regulatory systems are in the process of being developed and defined  and existing laws and regulations may be applied inconsistently 
also  in some circumstances  it may not be possible to obtain the legal remedies provided for under these laws and regulations in a reasonably timely manner  if at all 
transmittal of data by electronic means and telecommunications is subject to specific regulation in most central european countries 
although these regulations have not had a material impact on our business to date  changes in these regulations  including taxation or limitations on transfers of data across national borders  could have a material adverse effect on our business  growth  financial condition or results of operations 
we conduct business in many international markets with complex and evolving tax rules  including value added tax rules  which subjects us to international tax compliance risks 
while we obtain advice from legal and tax advisors as necessary to help assure compliance with tax and regulatory matters  most tax jurisdictions that we operate in have complex and subjective rules regarding the valuation of intercompany services  cross border payments between affiliated companies and the related effects on income tax  value added tax vat  transfer tax and share registration tax 
our foreign subsidiaries frequently undergo vat reviews  and from time to time undergo comprehensive tax reviews and may be required to make additional tax payments should the review result in different interpretations  allocations or valuations of our services 
because we are a public company  we will continue to incur costs for compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of  and we are exposed to future risks of non compliance with these regulations 
as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act of  on an annual basis  we evaluate our internal controls over financial reporting 
although our assessment  testing  and evaluation resulted in our conclusion that as of december   our internal controls over financial reporting were effective  we cannot predict the outcome of our testing in future periods 
if our internal controls are ineffective in future periods  our financial results or the market price of our stock could be adversely affected 
we will incur additional expenses and commitment of management s time in connection with further evaluations and there can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to comply with these regulations 
as allowable under the internal revenue code the code  the interest deduction from our convertible debentures are based on a comparable interest rate for a traditional  nonconvertible  fixed rate debt instrument with similar terms 
this allowable deduction is in excess of the stated interest rate 
this deduction may be deferred  limited or eliminated under certain conditions 
the u 
s treasury regulations contain an anti abuse regulation  set forth in section g  that grants the commissioner of the internal revenue service authority to depart from the regulations if a result is achieved which is unreasonable in light of the original issue discount provisions of the code  including section e 
the anti abuse regulation further provides that the commissioner may  under this authority  treat a contingent payment feature of a debt instrument as if it were a separate position 
if such an analysis were applied to our convertible debentures and ultimately sustained  our deductions attributable to the convertible debentures could be limited to the stated interest thereon 
the scope of application of the anti abuse regulations is unclear 
however  we are of the view that application of the contingent payment debt instrument regulations to our convertible debentures is a reasonable result such that the anti abuse regulation should not apply 
if a contrary position were asserted and ultimately sustained  our tax deductions would be severely diminished with a resulting adverse effect on our cash flow and ability to service the convertible debentures 
under the code  no deduction is allowed for interest expense in excess of million on convertible subordinated indebtedness incurred to acquire stock or assets of another corporation reduced by any interest paid on other obligations which have provided consideration for an acquisition of stock in another corporation 
if a significant portion of the proceeds from the issuance of the convertible debentures  either alone or together with other debt proceeds  were used for a domestic acquisition and the convertible debentures and other debt  if any  were deemed subordinated to certain trade creditors or were expressly subordinated to a substantial amount of unsecured creditors of the affiliated group  interest deductions for tax purposes in excess of million on such debt reduced by any interest paid on other obligations which have provided consideration for an acquisition of stock in another corporation would be disallowed 
this would adversely impact our cash flow and our ability to pay down the convertible debentures 
we previously applied a significant portion of the proceeds from our december issuance of convertible senior debentures due to acquisitions of foreign corporations 
the interest expense attributable to these acquisitions exhausted all of the million annual interest expense deduction permitted under the code for certain convertible subordinated debt incurred for corporation acquisitions 
accordingly  if this limitation were to apply  no interest deductions would be allowed with respect to our october convertible debentures due we do not currently anticipate that this limitation will apply but there can be no assurance of that fact 
the us senate has drafted proposed tax relief legislation that contains a provision that would eliminate the comparable interest rate deduction on future issuances of convertible debentures such as ours 
we cannot predict what the final proposed tax relief legislation  or future tax legislation  will include or whether it will be approved 
as a result of our us federal and state net operating loss carryforwards  we have not recognized the benefit of the comparable interest deduction 
however  the elimination of this provision could accelerate our future payment of us federal and state income taxes  if any 
because we are an international company conducting a complex business in many markets worldwide  we are subject to legal and operational risks related to staffing and management  as well as a broad array of local legal and regulatory requirements 
operating outside of the us creates difficulties associated with staffing and managing our international operations  complying with local legal and regulatory requirements 
because we operate financial transaction processing networks that offer new products and services to customers  the laws and regulations in the markets in which operate are subject to rapid change 
although we have local staff in countries in which we deem it appropriate  we cannot assure you that we will continue to be found to be operating in compliance with all applicable customs  currency exchange control regulations  data protection  transfer pricing regulations or any other laws or regulations to which we may be subject 
we also cannot assure you that these laws will not be modified in ways that may adversely affect our business 
because we derive our revenue from a multitude of countries with different currencies  our business is affected by local inflation and foreign currency exchange rates and policies 
we attempt to match any assets denominated in a currency with liabilities denominated in the same currency 
nonetheless  substantially all of our indebtedness is denominated in us dollars  euro and british pounds 
while a significant amount of our expenditures  including the acquisition of atms  executive salaries and certain long term telecommunication contracts  are made in us dollars  most of our revenues are denominated in other currencies 
as exchange rates among the us dollar  the euro  and other currencies fluctuate  the translation effect of these fluctuations may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition as reported in us dollars 
moreover  exchange rate policies have not always allowed for the free conversion of currencies at the market rate 
future fluctuations in the value of the dollar could continue to have an adverse effect on our results 
our consumer money transfer operations subject us to foreign currency exchange risks as our customers deposit us dollars at our retail locations in the united states and we typically deliver funds denominated in the destination country currencies to beneficiaries in mexico and other latin american countries 
we have various mechanisms in place to discourage takeover attempts  which may reduce or eliminate our stockholders ability to sell their shares for a premium in a change of control transaction 
various provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and of delaware corporate law may discourage  delay or prevent a change in control or takeover attempt of our company by a third party that is opposed to by our management and board of directors 
public stockholders who might desire to participate in such a transaction may not have the opportunity to do so 
these anti takeover provisions could substantially impede the ability of public stockholders to benefit from a change of control or change in our management and board of directors 
these provisions include preferred stock that could be issued by our board of directors to make it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or to discourage a third party from acquiring  a majority of our outstanding voting stock  classification of our directors into three classes with respect to the time for which they hold office  supermajority voting requirements to amend the provision in our certificate of incorporation providing for the classification of our directors into three such classes  non cumulative voting for directors  control by our board of directors of the size of our board of directors  limitations on the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders  and advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by our stockholders at stockholder meetings 
we have also approved a stockholders rights agreement the rights agreement between euronet and equiserve trust company  na  subsequently renamed computershare limited as rights agent 
pursuant to the rights agreement  holders of our common stock are entitled to purchase one one thousandth  of a share a unit of junior preferred stock at a price of per unit upon certain events 
the purchase price is subject to appropriate adjustment for stock splits and other similar events 
generally  in the event a person or entity acquires  or initiates a tender offer to acquire  at least of euronet s then outstanding common stock  the rights will become exercisable for common stock having a value equal to two times the exercise price of the right  or effectively at one half of euronet s then current stock price 
the existence of the rights plan may discourage  delay or prevent a change of control or takeover attempt of our company by a third party that is opposed to by our management and board of directors 
our directors and officers  together with the entities with which they are associated  owned about of our common stock as of december   giving them significant control over decisions related to our company 
this control includes the ability to influence the election of other directors of our company and to cast a large block of votes with respect to virtually all matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders 
this concentration of control may have the effect of delaying or preventing transactions or a potential change of control of our company 
an additional million shares of common stock could be added to our total common stock outstanding through the exercise of options or the issuance of additional shares of our common stock pursuant to existing agreements 
once issued  these shares of common stock could be traded into the market and result in a decrease in the market price of our common stock 
as of december   we had an aggregate of million options and restricted share awards outstanding held by our directors  officers and employees  which entitles these holders to acquire an equal number of shares of our common stock upon exercise 
of this amount  million options are currently vested  which means they can be exercised at any time 
approximately million additional shares of our common stock are issuable in connection with our employee stock purchase plan 
additionally  we may be required to issue approximately million shares of our common stock based on current prices and estimated earn out payments to the former shareholders or owners of the movilcarga assets and dynamic telecom under contingent earn out payments in connection with these acquisitions 
the number of shares issued under the earn outs will depend upon performance of the businesses acquired and the trading price of our common stock at the time we make the earn out payments 
another million shares of common stock could be issued upon conversion of the company s convertible debentures issued in december and october accordingly  approximately million shares based on current prices and estimated earn out payments could potentially be added to our total current common stock outstanding through the exercise of options or the issuance of additional shares  which could adversely impact the trading price for our stock 
the actual number of shares issuable could be higher depending upon the actual amounts of the earn outs and our stock price at the time of payment more shares could be issuable if our share price declines 
of the million total options and restricted share awards outstanding  an aggregate of million options and restricted shares are held by persons who may be deemed to be our affiliates and who would be subject to rule thus  upon exercise of their options  these affiliates shares would be subject to the trading restrictions imposed by rule the remainder of the common shares issuable under options or as earn outs described above would be freely tradable in the public market 
over the course of time  all of the issued shares have the potential to be publicly traded  perhaps in large blocks

item legal proceedings the company is from time to time a party to litigation arising in the ordinary course of its business

we operate the largest independent pan european atm network  the largest national shared atm network in india  and we are one of the largest providers of prepaid mobile airtime processing 
we operate in three principal business segments an eft processing segment  in which we process transactions for a network of  atms and more than  pos terminals across europe  the middle east  africa and india 
we provide comprehensive electronic payment solutions consisting of atm network participation  outsourced atm and pos management solutions  and electronic recharge services for prepaid mobile airtime via an atm or directly from the handset 
a prepaid processing segment  through which we provide processing of prepaid mobile airtime and other prepaid products 
we operate a network of more than  pos terminals providing electronic processing of prepaid mobile airtime top up services in the us  europe  africa and asia pacific 
this segment also includes euronet payments and remittance  which was formed upon the acquisition of telecommusa  and provides money transfer services to customers from the us to destinations in latin america and bill payment services to customers within the us a software solutions segment  through which we offer a suite of integrated eft software solutions for electronic payment and transaction delivery systems 
we have processing centers in the us  europe and asia and have principal offices in europe  four in the asia pacific region  three in the us and one in the middle east 
our executive offices are located in leawood  kansas  usa 
with approximately of our revenues denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  any significant changes in currency exchange rates will likely have a significant impact on our growth in revenues  operating income and diluted earnings per share for more discussion  see item a risk factors and item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk sources of revenues and cash flow euronet earns revenues and income based on atm management fees  transaction fees and commissions  professional services  software licensing fees and software maintenance agreements 
each business segment s sources of revenue are described below 
eft processing segment revenue in the eft processing segment  which represents of total consolidated revenue for the year ended december   is derived from fees charged for transactions effected by cardholders on our proprietary network of atms  as well as fixed management fees and transaction fees we charge to banks for operating atms under outsourcing agreements 
on our proprietary network  we generally charge fees for four types of atm transactions i cash withdrawals  ii balance inquiries  iii transactions not completed because the relevant card issuer does not give authorization and iv prepaid telecommunication recharges 
for the year ended december   approximately of total segment revenue was derived from atms we owned excluding those leased by us in connection with outsourcing agreements  as discussed below and the remainder was primarily derived from atms that we operate for banks on an outsourced basis see comparison of operating results for the years ended december   and by business segment compared to revenues 
the percentage of revenues we generate from our proprietary network of atms has fallen significantly over the past two years 
we believe this shift from a largely proprietary  euronet owned atm network  to a greater focus on atms operated under outsourcing agreements will provide higher marginal returns on investment 
this is because we bear all costs of owning and operating atms on our proprietary network  including the capital investment represented by the cost of the atms themselves  whereas customer owned atms operated under outsource service agreements require a nominal up front capital investment because we do not purchase the atms 
additionally  in many instances operating costs are the responsibility of the owner and  therefore  recurring operating expenses per atm are lower 
in connection with certain long term outsourcing agreements  we lease many of our atms under capital lease arrangements where  generally  we purchase a bank s atms  simultaneously sell the atms often to an entity related to the bank  we then lease back the atms for purposes of fulfilling the atm outsourcing agreement with the bank 
we fully recover the related lease costs from the bank under the outsourcing agreements 
prepaid processing segment revenue in the prepaid processing segment  which represents of total consolidated revenue for the year ended december   is derived from commissions or processing fees received from mobile and other telecommunication operators or from distributors of prepaid wireless products for the distribution and or processing of prepaid mobile airtime and other telecommunication products 
due to certain provisions in our mobile phone operator agreements  the operators have the ability to reduce the overall commission paid on each top up transaction 
however  by virtue of our agreements with retailers distributors where pos terminals are located in certain markets  not all of these reductions are absorbed by us because we are able to pass a significant portion of the reductions to retailers 
accordingly  under these retailer agreements  the effect is to reduce revenues and reduce our direct operating costs resulting in only a small impact  if any  on gross margin and operating income 
in australia  certain retailers negotiate directly with the mobile phone operators for their own commission rates 
agreements with mobile operators are important to the success of our business 
these agreements permit us to distribute prepaid mobile airtime to the mobile operators customers 
the loss of any agreements with mobile operators in any market could materially and adversely affect our results 
during  we launched our money transfer and bill payment services  euronet payments and remittance  inc euronet payments and remittance  through the acquisition of telecommusa 
euronet payments and remittance s patented card based money transfer and bill payment system allows transactions to be initiated primarily through pos terminals and integrated cash register systems 
transactions can also be initiated through the internet  fax or telephone 
revenue in the money transfer and bill payment business is earned through the charging of a transaction fee  as well as a commission representing the difference between purchasing foreign currency at wholesale exchange rates and selling the foreign currency to consumers at retail exchange rates 
we have origination and distribution agents in place and each earns a fee for the cash collection and distribution services 
these fees are recognized as direct operating costs at the time of sale 
as discussed in other trends and uncertainties below  we incurred an operating loss of million for the year ended december  and we expect to continue incurring operating losses of more than million during as we expand this business 
software solutions segment revenue in the software solutions segment  which represents of total consolidated revenue for the year ended december   is derived from licensing  professional services and maintenance fees for software and sales of related hardware 
software license fees are the initial fees we charge to license our proprietary application software to customers 
professional fees consist of charges for customization  installation and consulting services to customers 
software maintenance revenue represents the ongoing fees charged for maintenance and support for customers software products 
hardware sales are derived from the sale of computer equipment necessary for the respective software solution 
opportunities and challenges our expansion plans and opportunities are focused on four primary areas within our business segments i outsourced atm management contracts  ii transactions processed on our network of owned and operated atms  iii our prepaid mobile airtime top up processing services  and iv our money transfer and bill payment services 
eft processing segment the continued expansion and development of our atm business will depend on various factors including the following the impact of competition by banks and other atm operators and service providers in our current target markets  the demand for our atm outsourcing services in our current target markets  the ability to develop products or services to drive increases in transactions  the expansion of our various business lines in markets where we operate and new markets  entering into additional card acceptance and atm management agreements with banks  the ability to obtain required licenses in markets we intend to enter or expand services  the availability of financing for expansion  and the ability to efficiently convert atms contracted under newly awarded outsourcing agreements 
we carefully monitor the revenue and transactional growth of our atm networks in each of our markets  and we adjust our plans depending on local market conditions  such as variations in the transaction fees we receive  competition  overall trends in atm transaction levels and performance of individual atms 
we consistently evaluate and add prospects to our list of potential atm outsource customers 
however  we cannot predict the increase or decrease in the number of atms we manage under outsourcing agreements  because this depends largely on the willingness of banks to enter into outsourcing contracts with us 
due to the thorough internal reviews and extensive negotiations conducted by existing and prospective banking customers in choosing outsource vendors  the process of entering into or renewing outsourcing agreements can take approximately nine months to more than one year 
the process is further complicated by the legal and regulatory considerations of local countries 
these agreements tend to cover large numbers of atms  so significant increases and decreases in our pool of managed atms could result from signature or termination of these management contracts 
therefore  the timing of both current and new contract revenues is uncertain and unpredictable 
in january  through jiayintong beijing technology development co 
ltd  our owned joint venture with ray holdings in china  we entered into an atm outsourcing pilot agreement with postal savings and remittance bureau psrb  a financial institution located and organized in china 
this pilot agreement makes us the first and currently the only provider of end to end atm outsourcing services in china  a market that has been projected in a report by retail banking research  ltd 
to deploy approximately  additional atms by this compares to a projected deployment of approximately an aggregate of  atms during the same period in central and eastern european countries such as poland  slovakia  croatia  the czech republic and hungary 
this is an indicator of the potential growth opportunities in some of the markets where we currently operate 
under the pilot contract we have agreed to deploy and provide all of the day to day outsourcing services for a total of atms in beijing  shanghai and guandong  the three largest commercial centers in china 
we expect these atms to become operational during the next several months 
if this pilot agreement meets certain success criteria  we have agreed to take over additional existing atms and install new atms  at psrb s request 
we have established a processing center in beijing to drive these atms 
our future success in china will depend on our ability to be successful in this pilot agreement  the willingness of psrb to outsource additional atms to us and our ability to take over and install additional atms as required by the agreement 
while we believe that we have the proper resources and skills in place to be successful  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in the pilot agreement or that we will be successful in our ability to take over existing atms or install new atms as expected by psrb 
prepaid processing segment we currently offer prepaid mobile phone top up services in the us  europe  africa and asia pacific  money transfer services to customers from the us to destinations in latin america  and bill payment services to customers in the us we plan to expand our top up business in these and other markets by taking advantage of our existing expertise together with relationships with mobile phone operators and retailers 
we plan to expand our card based money transfer and bill payment services by offering the product on many of our existing pos terminals in the us and internationally 
expansion will depend on various factors  including  but not necessarily limited to  the following the ability to negotiate new agreements for other markets with mobile phone operators  agent banks and retailers  the continuation of the trend of conversion from scratch card solutions to electronic processing solutions for prepaid mobile airtime among mobile phone users and the continued use of third party providers such as ourselves to supply this service  the development of mobile phone networks in these markets and the increase in the number of mobile phone users  the continuation of the trend of increased use of electronic money transfer and bill payment among immigrant workers and the unbanked population in our markets  the overall pace of growth in the prepaid mobile phone market  our market share of the retail distribution capacity  the level of commission that is paid to the various intermediaries in prepaid mobile airtime distribution chain  our ability to obtain licenses to operate in many of the states within the us and internationally  the ability to rapidly maximize the opportunity to sell our card based money transfer and bill payment product over our existing pos terminals in the us and internationally  and the availability of financing for further expansion 
in mature markets  such as the uk  australia and ireland  the conversion from scratch cards to electronic forms of distribution is either complete or nearing completion 
therefore  this factor will cease to provide the organic increases in the number of transactions per terminal that we have experienced historically 
also in mature markets  competition among prepaid distributors results in the reduction of commissions and margins paid by mobile operators  as well as retailer churn 
the combined impact of these factors in developed markets is a flattening of growth in the revenues and profits that we earn 
in other markets in which we operate  such as poland  germany  spain and the us  many of the factors that may contribute to rapid growth conversion from scratch cards to electronic distribution  growth in the prepaid market  expansion of our network of retailers and access to all mobile operators products remain present 
growth in our money transfer and bill payment services business  euronet payments and remittance  will be driven by the continuation of global worker migration patterns  our ability to manage rapid growth  our ability to maximize the opportunity to sell our card based product over our existing pos terminals in the us and internationally  and our ability to obtain licenses to operate in many of the states within the us as well as other countries 
currently focused on the us and latin american market  we plan to expand our money transfer services to other markets 
we have access to over  pos terminals in the us and we are focusing on increasing our sending locations in existing licensed states and obtaining licenses to operate in other key states 
throughout and into early  we expanded these operations from the original three states into four additional states 
we also have six other states where we are currently introducing these services and an additional states where licenses are pending approval 
combined  we have access to more than  pos terminals in these states 
according to the inter american development bank report  sending money home remittances to latin america from the us   money transfers originating in these states accounted for approximately of money transfer from the us to latin america in expansion of our money transfer business internationally will require resolution of numerous licensing and regulatory issues in each market we intend to develop and no assurance can be given that these issues will be resolved 
software solutions segment software products are an integral part of our product lines  and our investment in research  development  delivery and customer support reflects our ongoing commitment to an expanded customer base 
we have been able to enter into agreements under which we use our software in lieu of cash as our initial capital contributions to new transaction processing joint ventures 
such contribution sometimes permits us to enter new markets without significant capital investment 
additionally  this segment supports our eft processing segment and is a valuable element of our overall business strategy 
the competitive factors in the software solutions business include price  technology development and the ability of software systems to interact with other leading products 
our success is dependent on our ability to design and implement software applications 
technical disruptions or errors in these systems could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and financial results 
in january  we acquired the assets of essentis limited essentis  a uk company that owns a leading card issuing and merchant acquiring software package 
the assets  primarily consisting of the software package  were purchased out of an administration proceeding for approximately million  including the assumption of certain liabilities 
the essentis software product allows us to add additional outsourcing and software offerings to banks 
corporate services  eliminations and other in addition to operating in our principal business segments described above  corporate services  elimination and other includes non operating results  certain inter segment eliminations and the cost of providing corporate and other administrative services to the business segments 
these services are not directly identifiable with our business segments 
the accounting policies of each segment are the same as those referenced in the summary of significant accounting policies see note summary of significant accounting policies and practices to the consolidated financial statements 
we evaluate performance of our segments based on income or loss from continuing operations before income taxes  foreign exchange gain loss  minority interest and other nonrecurring gains and losses 
for all segments  our continued expansion may involve acquisitions that could divert our resources and management time and require integration of new assets with our existing networks and services 
our ability to effectively manage our rapid growth has required us to expand our operating systems and employee base  particularly at the management level  which has added incremental operating costs 
an inability to continue to effectively manage expansion could have a material adverse effect on our business  growth  financial condition or results of operations 
inadequate technology and resources would impair our ability to maintain current processing technology and efficiencies as well as deliver new and innovative services to compete in the marketplace

additionally  in we acquired instreamline and began consolidating europlanet after increasing our ownership to from to 
instreamline was acquired in october and provides credit card and pos outsourcing services and transaction gateway switching services in greece and the balkan region 
our ownership in europlanet was increased through two transactions  one in april  in which we increased our ownership from to  and one in december  in which we acquired the final ownership 
europlanet provides debit card processing services and manages a network of atms and pos terminals in serbia 
revenue per average atm was  for compared to  for and revenue per transaction was for compared to for the decrease in revenue per transaction is mainly the result of a continued shift from owning atms to managing them under outsourcing agreements 
under outsourcing agreements  we primarily earn revenue based on fixed recurring monthly management fee  with less dependence on transaction based fees because incremental transactions have little impact on the fixed or variable costs of managing atms 
therefore  an overall increase in the number of transactions processed on atms that are managed under outsourcing agreements generally does not generate commensurate increases in revenues 
we believe this shift from a largely proprietary  euronet owned atm network to operating atms under outsourcing arrangements has provided  and will continue to provide  higher marginal returns on investment 
see source of revenues and cash flow 
while expansion of our network of owned atms is not one of our strategic initiatives  if opportunities were available to us  we would consider increasing future capital expenditures to expand this network in new or existing markets 
of total segment revenue for  was from atms we owned  was from atms operated under management outsourcing agreements with capital lease arrangements  was from management outsourcing agreements only and the remaining was from other sources 
this compares to   and  respectively  for direct operating costs direct operating costs consist primarily of site rental fees  cash delivery costs  cash supply costs  maintenance  insurance  telecommunications and the cost of data center operations related personnel  as well as the processing centers facility related costs and other processing center related expenses 
the increase in direct operating cost for compared to is attributed to the increase in the number of atms under operation 
direct operating costs decreased to of revenues for  compared to of revenues for this reduction resulted from operating a greater percentage of outsourced atms  for which direct costs per atm  and on an average per transaction basis  are lower than the existing installed base of atms  together with leveraging the fixed or semi fixed data center costs 
gross margin gross margin  which is revenue less direct operating costs  increased to million for from million for gross margin per average atm was  for  an increase compared to  for the increase in gross margin per average atm is largely the result of increasing transactions and related fees from the installed atm base  together with the leveraged effect of adding additional atm outsourcing revenues and profits to a direct cost structure that is more fixed than variable with volume 
gross margin per transaction decreased to for  compared to for under certain outsourcing agreements  revenue and gross margin are derived increasingly from fixed charges based upon atms under management and other charges and not from incremental transactions 
accordingly  in such arraignments increased transaction volumes do not drive commensurate increases in total revenue and gross margin dollars 
further  because we realize the benefit of certain economies of scale within our atm network  increased transaction volumes do not drive commensurate increases the amount of in direct costs or direct costs on a per transaction basis 
of total segment gross margin  approximately was from atms we owned  approximately was from atms operated under management outsourcing agreements with capital lease arrangements  was from management outsourcing agreements without capital lease arrangements and the remaining was from other sources 
this compares to   and  respectively  for the changes are the result of increasing our outsourcing of atms and not expanding our ownership of atms 
salaries and benefits the increase in salaries and benefits for compared to is due to our growing business in india and romania  the acquisitions of instreamline and europlanet  staffing costs to expand in emerging markets such as china  and general merit increases awarded to employees 
certain staffing increases were also necessary due to the larger number of atms under operation and transactions processed 
these expenses as a percentage of revenue  however  continued to trend downward during decreasing to  compared to for the this decrease as a percentage of revenue reflects increased leverage and scalability in our markets 
selling  general and administrative similar to the increase in salaries and benefits  the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses over is also due to our growing businesses in india and romania  the acquisitions of instreamline and europlanet and costs incurred to expand into emerging markets  including china 
however  these costs remained flat at of revenue for both and offsetting these costs for was million for an insurance recovery recorded during the first quarter this insurance recovery related to a loss recorded in the fourth quarter on certain atm disbursements resulting from a card association s change in their data exchange format 
depreciation and amortization the increase in depreciation and amortization expense from to is due to depreciation on additional atms under capital lease arrangements related to outsourcing agreements in poland and india  depreciation and intangible amortization related to the acquisitions of instreamline and europlanet  additional processing center computer equipment necessary to handle increased transaction volumes and technology upgrades to certain of our owned atms throughout and as a percentage of revenue  these expenses continued to trend downward to of revenue for from of revenue for as a result of our shift from owned atms to outsourced atms discussed above 
we expect that depreciation as a percentage of revenue will continue to decrease as more atms reach the end of their depreciable lives and atms are not replaced  and we continue to increase the number of atms that we operate under atm management agreements rather than as owner operators 
operating income the increase in operating income for the segment is generally the result of increased revenue  and the related gross margins  from new atm outsourcing and network participation agreements combined with leveraging certain management cost structures 
operating income as a percentage of revenue was for  compared to for operating income per transaction was for  compared to for operating income per average atm was  for  compared to  for the continuing increases in operating income as a percentage of revenue  per transaction and per atm is due to increased leverage and scalability in our markets  as well as the continuing migration toward operating atms under management through outsourcing agreements rather than ownership arrangements 
additionally  operating income for includes a net operating loss of million related to our owned joint venture in china 
we expect to generate a similar operating loss in china during as we continue to focus on expansion in this market

these increases primarily relate to atm management agreements in poland  romania and india 
revenue per average atm was  in  compared to  in  or a decrease 
revenue per transaction decreased to for from for as further discussed in compared to above  generally  the decrease in revenue per transaction was the result of a continued shift from euronet proprietarily owned atms to atms managed under outsourcing agreements 
under outsourcing agreements  the company primarily earns revenue based on fixed recurring monthly management fee  with less dependence on transaction based fees because incremental transactions have little impact on the fixed or variable costs of managing atms 
therefore  an overall increase in the number of transactions processed on atms that are managed under outsourcing agreements generally does not generate commensurate increases in revenues

this compares to   and  respectively  for direct operating costs direct operating costs increased to of revenue for from for direct operating costs per atm were  and  for and  respectively 
the increase for was attributed to a gain of million recorded as an offset to direct operating expenses during for the sale of hungarian atms 
direct operating costs per transaction decreased to per transaction during from per transaction during the improvement in direct operating costs per transaction was the result of increasing transaction volumes at existing sites  without commensurate increases in direct operating costs  costs associated with these sites increase at a slower rate  or not at all  compared to transaction volumes 
additional improvements resulted from installing outsourced atms whose direct costs per atm and on an average per transaction basis were lower than the existing installed base of atms 
as discussed under revenues above  the number of atms that we operate under atm management outsourcing agreements increased as compared to atms that we own and operate 
outsourced atms generally have lower direct operating expenses telecommunications  cash delivery  security  maintenance and site rental because  depending on the customer  the customer retains the responsibility for certain operational costs 
gross margin gross margin per atm  which is revenue less direct operating costs  was  and  for and  respectively 
gross margin per transaction was and for and  respectively 
the decreases in gross margin per atm and gross margin per transaction were the result of a non recurring million gain on the sale of hungarian atms in recognized as a reduction in direct operating costs and as a result of a significant increase in transactions related to atms managed under outsourcing agreements where the average number of transactions per atm was significantly higher than the average transactions per atm of the existing installed base 
of total segment gross margin  approximately was from atms we owned  approximately was from atms operated under management outsourcing agreements with capital lease arrangements  was from management outsourcing agreements without capital lease arrangements and the remaining was from other sources 
this compares to   and  respectively  for salaries and benefits and selling  general and administrative expenses salaries and benefits increased by  and selling  general and administrative expenses increased by during compared to due to euronet s growing business in asian markets  staffing for the outsourcing agreement in romania and certain incentive compensation payments earned based on meeting or exceeding performance plans and general merit increases awarded to employees 
certain staffing increases were also necessary due to the larger number of atms under operation and transactions processed 
these expenses as a percentage of revenue  however  continued to trend downward during decreasing to a total of for compared to for this decrease as a percentage of revenue reflects the leverage and scalability associated with increases in revenue without commensurate increases in salaries and benefits and selling  general and administrative expenses 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense for increased compared to this increase is due to additional depreciation on more than atms under capital lease arrangements related to an outsourcing agreement in poland implemented in the first half of  additional atms under capital lease arrangement for our growing business in india  additional processing center computer equipment necessary to handle increased transaction volumes and technology upgrades to certain of our owned atms during operating income operating income for increased over and operating income as a percentage of revenue increased to during from for operating income per transaction was during and  and operating income per atm increased to  in from  in the continuing increases in operating income as a percentage of revenue and per atm was due to significant growth in revenues and transactions without commensurate increases in operating expenses  as well as the continuing migration toward operating atms under management outsourcing agreements rather that ownership arrangements 
in addition  in our eft operations in india began managing a number of atms under outsourcing agreements sufficient to produce positive operating results in the latter part of asia pacific operating losses were reduced from million in to million in prepaid processing segment the prepaid processing segment was established in with the acquisition of e pay  limited 
this segment has been further expanded through the acquisitions of aim and transact in  precept  eps  cpi and movilcarga in  and dynamic telecom  telerecarga  telecommusa and atx in these transactions are more fully described in note acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements 
compared to due to the rapid growth of this segment of our operations  the following discussion and analysis will focus on comparisons of both actual results for the years ended december  and and  as appropriate  pro forma results prepared as if all acquisitions had taken place as of january  our pro forma data is only adjusted for the timing of acquisitions and does not include adjustments for costs related to integration activities  cost savings or synergies that have or may be achieved by the combined businesses 
in the opinion of management  this information is neither indicative of what our results would have been had we operated these businesses since january   nor is it indicative of our future results

transaction growth reflects growth from existing operations  the full year effects of all our acquisitions and additional revenue from our current year acquisitions 
since the date of acquisition  acquisitions contributed increased revenues of million for and our acquisitions contributed revenues of million 
additionally  revenues have grown from the effects of retailer agreements implemented during and revenue growth from all of our subsidiaries subsequent to the date of acquisition 
although we experienced revenue growth of and at our e pay subsidiaries in the u 
k and australia  respectively  during due to increases in the number of transactions processed  we do not expect growth rates at these significant levels to continue 
in these mature markets we expect revenue growth to slow substantially because conversion from scratch cards to electronic top up is approaching completion and certain mobile operators and retailers are driving competitive reductions in pricing and margins 
we expect most of our revenue growth from and beyond to be derived from developing markets or markets in which there is organic growth in the prepaid sector overall  from continued conversion from scratch cards to electronic top up from additional products sold over the base of prepaid processing terminals and  possibly  acquisitions 
on a pro forma basis  revenues increased over by million as a result of the addition of pos terminals throughout all of our markets  and increased volumes driven by mobile operators shifting from scratch card distribution to electronic distribution 
revenue per transaction was for  compared to for this decrease is due to our expansion into markets such as spain  germany and poland where we earn less revenue per transaction  but are able to keep a greater percentage of the commission  thus having little if any impact on gross margin 
additionally  our atx subsidiary  which was acquired at the end of the first quarter  provides only transaction processing services without direct costs and other operating costs associated with installing and managing terminals  therefore  the revenue we recognize from these transactions is less than one tenth of that recognized on average transactions  but with virtually no costs 
direct operating costs direct operating costs in the prepaid processing segment include the commissions we pay to retail merchants for the distribution and sale of prepaid mobile airtime and other prepaid products  as well as communication and paper expenses required to operate pos terminals 
because of their nature  these expenditures generally track directly with revenues and processed transactions 
accordingly  the increase in direct operating costs generally corresponds to increases in revenues and transactions processed 
however  direct costs as a percentage of revenue are slightly higher in our mature markets  such as the uk and australia 
these higher costs were mostly offset in by lower direct costs as a percentage of revenue in other markets and by atx 
as discussed above  atx is a transaction processor  with very few direct costs and  accordingly  a high gross margin percentage 
gross margin gross margin  which represents revenue less direct costs  increased by million  or  to million for  compared to million for this increase is generally correlated to the increase in transactions processed 
gross margin per transaction was for  compared to per transaction for gross margin as a percentage of revenue was for both periods presented 
as discussed under direct operating costs above  reduced margins in our mature markets  such as the uk and australia  have been largely offset by improved margins in other markets as well as the effects of atx 
salaries and benefits salaries and benefits increased to of revenue for from of revenue for this increase was related to costs of approximately million incurred in connection with our money transfer and bill payment product and additional sales resources in the us and australian markets added in the last quarter of and first half of selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expense for increased to of revenue compared to of revenue for similar to the increase in salaries and benefits  this increase is due to our continued focus on expanding operations in the us and costs incurred to grow our money transfer and bill payment product 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense primarily represents amortization of acquired intangibles and the depreciation of pos terminals we install in retail stores 
as a percentage of revenue  depreciation and amortization was for and for this increase is due to higher depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of revenue related to our subsidiaries in the us  spain and poland  many of which were acquired or established during and  because each of these entities owns a majority of its pos terminals 
additionally  we recorded higher amortization expense of approximately million for our transact subsidiary during  as compared to due to an adjustment to our preliminary purchase price allocation increasing intangible assets  such as customer relationships  which are amortized  and decreasing goodwill  which is not amortized 
see note goodwill and acquired intangible assets  net  to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this adjustment 
operating income the improvement in operating income for over was due to the significant growth in revenues and transactions processed  together with contributions from our and acquisitions 
operating income for includes approximately million in operating losses related to our money transfer and bill payment business acquired in the second quarter operating income as a percentage of revenues decreased to for  from for and per transaction decreased to for  from in this decrease is due to our focus on expansion in the us  poland and australia  and costs incurred in connection with our new money transfer and bill payment business 
we expect to incur a similar annualized operating loss during related to our money transfer and bill payment business 
pro forma operating margin percentage decreased to for  compared to for as a result of the inclusion of our acquisitions in the us and spain in the pro forma results for  which included the positive impact of operating margin rich  opportunistic  short lived wholesale arrangements that were not ongoing in nature 
compared to due to the rapid growth of this segment  the following discussion and analysis will focus on comparisons of both actual results for the years ended december  and and  as appropriate  pro forma results prepared as if our and acquisitions had taken place as of january  our pro forma data is only adjusted for the timing of acquisitions and does not include adjustments for costs related to integration activities  cost savings or synergies that have or may be achieved by the combined businesses

total transactions processed during increased over  reflecting growth in existing operations  the impact of our acquisitions and the full year effects of our acquisitions 
our acquisitions contributed million to revenues 
the full year impact of the acquisitions resulted in increased revenues of million for additionally  revenues increased due to the full year effects of retailer agreements implemented in  as well as the expansion of operations in new zealand  ireland and poland during approximately of our revenue increase over was from the acquired entities growth subsequent to the date of acquisition resulting from contracts with many new retailers and through increased prepaid traffic over our existing terminals 
on a pro forma basis  revenues increased due to the addition of pos terminals throughout all of our markets  combined with mobile operators shifting from scratch card distribution to electronic distribution 
revenue per transaction decreased to for compared to for due in large part to the full year impact of decreases in uk commissions from mobile operators during this decrease in commissions has had minimal impact on margins because we are often able to pass the reductions through to retailers 
moreover  further contributing to this decrease in average revenue per transaction was the full year inclusion of transact  which we acquired in november the majority of the transactions processed by transact earn revenues based on transaction fees from distributors  where the distributor directly contracts with the mobile operators for prepaid mobile airtime distribution and pay transact a fee to process the related transactions 
direct operating costs the increase in direct operating costs generally corresponded to the increase in both transactions and revenues 
direct operating expenses per transaction were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in cost per transaction was primarily due to two aspects of our businesses i mobile operator rate decreases in the uk  which were passed through to retailers  and ii the full year impact of the operations of transact  which was acquired during november  the majority of the transactions currently processed by transact earn revenues based on a transactional fee structure with minimal or no related direct costs 
gross margin gross margin  which represents revenue less direct costs  increased by million  or  to million for  compared to million for gross margin was and for and  respectively  and gross margin per transaction was for both years 
salaries and benefits salaries and benefits for increased by over  however  remained flat at of revenue for both and the increase in expense over was the result of the inclusion of salaries of acquired entities  staffing to accommodate the transactional volume growth and annual merit increases 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expense for increased as a result of acquisitions and increased to of revenue compared to of revenue for the expansion of prepaid processing in us market contributed to the increase in selling  general and administrative expense in total and as a percentage of revenue 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense  which primarily represents amortization of acquired intangibles  was higher for than for due to the full year impact of the amortization of intangible assets acquired during  as well as the current year amortization of intangible assets acquired during however  depreciation and amortization as a percentage of revenue decreased to for from for  reflecting growth in revenues from e pay  transact and aim subsequent to their acquisition  without commensurate increases in depreciation and amortization expense 
operating income operating income for increased compared to and increased to of revenue for from of revenue for due to the significant growth in revenues and transactions processed  while slightly lowering our total operating costs as a percentage of revenue to for compared to for on a pro forma basis  operating income for increased compared to and remained relatively flat at of revenue for  compared to of revenue for software solutions segment the following table summarizes the results of operations for the software solutions segment for the years ended december   and year over year change increase increase year ended december  decrease decrease dollar amounts in thousands percent percent total revenues operating expenses direct operating costs salaries and benefits selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization total operating expenses operating income the software solutions segment recognizes revenue from license fees  professional services and maintenance fees for software and sales of related hardware 
software license fees are the fees we charge to license our proprietary application software to customers 
professional service fees consist of charges for customization  installation and consulting services to customers 
software maintenance revenue represents the ongoing fees charged for maintenance and support for customers software products 
hardware sales are derived from the sale of computer equipment necessary for the respective software solution 
the components of software solutions revenue are summarized in the following table year ended december  in thousands software license fees professional service fees maintenance fees hardware sales total revenue revenues during  the business mix reflected a larger percentage related to professional service contracts to upgrade our clients to a standardized release level  which typically generate lower revenues 
this is consistent with the software solutions long term strategy to position our client base to take advantage of our new license offerings 
in  we realized a shift back to increased license fees that resulted in increased license revenue 
this resulted in an increase in revenues in this segment in over of  compared to a decrease in revenues in over of 
the decline from to was due to a decrease in revenue recognized from the sale of software licenses to fidelity national financial  formerly alltel information systems 
revenues recognized related to this contract totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
together  both software license fees and professional service fees were million for  as compared to million for and million for maintenance fees have remained relatively flat for all three years 
since hardware sales are an incidental component to the segment s software license and professional service products  the decreases from to and the increase from to are also related to the increase or decrease in software license fees and professional service fees 
software sales backlog software sales backlog is defined as fees specified in contracts that have been executed and for which we expect recognition of the related revenue within one year 
our backlog was million  million and million as of december   and  respectively 
the average backlog was million and million for and  respectively 
there can be no assurance that the contracts included in these backlog figures will generate revenue within the one year period 
operating expenses direct operating costs consist of hardware costs and distributor commissions 
hardware costs are incidental to our software license fee and professional service products and have increased relative to hardware sales 
direct operating costs increased for as compared to and decreased for as compared to the majority of the increase for related to increases in distributor commissions as we enhanced our distributor relationships and signed distributor contracts 
the majority of the decrease for related to reductions in distributor commissions commensurate with the decrease in sales 
we expect to continue pursuing strategic distributor relationships during salary and benefits expense remained relatively flat for as compared to and decreased for as compared to the decreases are the result of our cost control efforts 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased for as compared to and decreased for as compared to these decreases related to the continuing efforts to control expenses by reducing bad debt  rental  professional fees and travel related expenses 
we capitalize software development costs on a product by product basis once technological feasibility is established 
technological feasibility is established after the completion of all planning  designing  coding and testing activities necessary to establish that the product can be produced to meet its design specifications  including functions  features and technical performance requirements 
amounts capitalized were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we are continuing the development  maintenance and enhancement of our products  and total research and development costs for software products to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed  including amounts capitalized were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
operating income the segment s total operating income increased from to and from to this overall improvement is due largely to increased license fees together with continued cost management efforts 
corporate services and other the components of corporate services operating expenses were year over year change increase year ended december  decrease increase dollar amounts in thousands percent percent salaries and benefits selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization total operating expenses operating expenses for corporate services increased by for the year ended december  from the year ended december   and increased for the year ended december  from the year ended december  the increase for is primarily attributable to increased salary expense related to overall growth 
the increase in is primarily attributable to professional fees for sarbanes oxley compliance and resources to support the significant growth in the business 
we estimate that we incurred approximately million in incremental and recurring costs in to fulfill the requirements of sarbanes oxley compliance 
interest income interest income increased to million for the year ended december  from million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase for was primarily due to the interest earned on the unused proceeds from the million december  and million october convertible debt issuances 
interest income for both and also increased due to higher average cash deposits held in our trust accounts related to the administration of customer collections and vendor remittance activities of the growing prepaid processing segment and continual increases in average interest rates 
interest expense interest expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million in and million in and  as a result of the debt transactions described in liquidity and capital resources below 
our weighted average interest rate decreased to for  from for both and the increase in interest expense for was primarily due to interest expense  including amortization of deferred debt issuance costs  related to our million in outstanding contingent convertible debentures described in note debt obligations to the consolidated financial statements 
the million  debentures that we issued december were outstanding for all of and our million  debentures issued during october were outstanding for the fourth quarter our interest expense for was relatively flat compared the amount incurred during  although our overall debt level increased to as of december  from million as of december  substantially all of this increase occurred on december  after we completed our million contingent convertible debenture offering 
since this transaction occurred so close to the end of the year and accrues interest at  the impact on the amount of interest expense incurred during was not significant 
gain on sale of uk atm network in january  we sold of the shares in our uk subsidiary for million 
concurrently with this sale  we signed a services agreement with the buyer whereby the eft processing segment will provide atm operating  monitoring and transaction processing services to the buyer through december  as a result of this sale  we recognized a gain on the sale of million and deferred the recognition of million in revenue  which is being recognized ratably over the five year service agreement 
moreover  we recognized no tax expense on this sale as a result of the favorable treatment of such gains between the netherlands  where the parent of the uk subsidiary is incorporated  and the uk the uk s results continue to be included in continuing operations due the ongoing outsourcing revenues as well as those deferred 
income from unconsolidated affiliates euronet recorded million  million and million in equity in income from unconsolidated affiliates during  and  respectively 
the improvement over prior years is primarily due to improved results from our investment in e pay malaysia and million in dividends recorded related to europlanet and atx  which were declared before we obtained control of these entities 
loss on early retirement of debt we recorded a loss on early retirement of debt of million during related to the redemption and repayment of the remaining million in senior discount notes 
this transaction is further described in note debt obligations to the consolidated financial statements 
net foreign exchange loss foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities give rise to foreign exchange gains and losses as a result of us dollar to local currency exchange movements 
we recorded net foreign exchange losses of million  million and million for  and  respectively 
exchange gains and losses that result from re measurement of certain assets and liabilities are recorded in determining net income 
a significant portion of our assets and liabilities are denominated in euros  british pounds  and other currencies 
the foreign exchange gain or loss recorded is a result of the net receivable or payable position of our foreign currency based subsidiaries  together with the fluctuation foreign exchange rates 
we attempt to match local currency receivables and payables  thereby minimizing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations 
income tax expense income tax expense was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in tax expense is due to the growing profitability of individual companies in the prepaid processing and eft processing segments  particularly in western europe and australia 
our effective tax rate on pretax income from continuing operations was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
since we are in a net operating loss position for our us operations and  accordingly  have valuation allowances to reserve for net deferred tax assets  we do not currently recognize the tax benefit or expense associated with foreign currency exchange gains or losses incurred by our us entities 
additionally  foreign currency exchange gains and losses represent a significant permanent difference for purposes of calculating book tax expense for certain of our foreign holding companies 
excluding foreign currency gains and losses from pre tax book income  our effective tax rate was for  compared to for the effective tax rate for the year ended december  included a non taxable gain on the sale of the uk atm network  which resulted in a lower effective tax rate 
accordingly  excluding the gain in the effective tax rate for the years ended december  and would have been significantly lower than the substantial decrease in the year over year effective tax rates  excluding foreign currency gains and losses and the non taxable gain  was largely attributable to the relative increase in profitability of individual companies located in lower than average tax rate jurisdictions  particularly hungary  poland and romania  and the consolidation of europlanet  which operates in the low tax rate jurisdiction of serbia  together with increasing operating profits in countries with remaining net operating loss carryforwards  such as the us  poland and india 
we determine income tax expense and remit income taxes based upon enacted tax laws and regulations applicable in each of the taxing jurisdictions where we conduct business 
based on our interpretation of such laws and regulations  and considering the evidence of available facts and circumstances and baseline operating forecasts  we have accrued the estimated tax effects of certain transactions  business ventures  contractual and organizational structures  projected business unit performance  and the estimated future reversal of timing differences 
should a taxing jurisdiction change its laws and regulations or dispute our conclusions  or should management become aware of new facts or other evidence that could alter our conclusions  the resulting impact to our estimates could have a material adverse effect to our consolidated financial statements 
minority interest minority interest represents the elimination of the net income loss attributable to the minority shareholders portion of our consolidated subsidiaries that are not wholly owned  including movilcarga  of which we own  europlanet  of which we owned until the end of  atx  of which we own  and our subsidiary in china  of which we own discontinued operations discontinued operations for the year ended december  include a million loss on the final liquidation of the france atm network processing services business sold in this loss consists primarily of the reclassification to net income of the cumulative translation adjustment that had previously been recorded as a component stockholders equity accumulated other comprehensive income due to the prior years consolidation of the france operations 
discontinued operations for the year ended december  included million in operating expenses related to remaining administrative functions of the france operations 
there were no results from discontinued operations for the year ended december  net income we recorded net income of million  million and million for  and  respectively 
as more fully discussed above  the increase of million for compared to was the result of an increase in operating income of million  an increase in equity from unconsolidated subsidiaries of million and a decrease in net interest expense of million  offset by an increase in foreign exchange losses of million  an increase in income tax expense of million and other items of million 
the increase of million for compared to was the result of an increase in operating income of million  a decrease in net interest expense of million and a decrease in foreign exchange losses of million  offset by an increase in income tax expense of million  a loss on the early retirement of debt of million and a decrease in income from unconsolidated subsidiaries of million 
additionally  included an million gain on the sale of the uk atm network 
these changes are more fully discussed above 
liquidity and capital resources working capital as of december   we had working capital  which is the difference between total current assets and total current liabilities  of million  compared to working capital of million as of december  our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was at december   compared to as of december  the increase in working capital and the improvement in the ratio of current assets to current liabilities were due to the unused proceeds from the october issuance of million in convertible debentures 
these proceeds are included in current assets  while the debt incurred is reflected as a long term liability 
therefore  these unused proceeds have the impact of both increasing working capital and improving our ratio of current assets to current liabilities 
operating cash flows cash flows provided by operating activities increased to million in  compared to million in the improvement over last year was mainly due to stronger operating profit in all segments 
investing activity cash flow cash flows used in investing activities were million in  compared to million in our investing activities include million in cash paid related primarily to the acquisitions of telerecarga  movilcarga  atx  telecommusa  europlanet and instreamline  as well as the cash earn out payment to the former owners of transact 
additionally  cash outflows for purchases of property and equipment and other investing activities totaled million 
our investing activities included million for the acquisition of precept  eps  cpi and movilcarga  and capital expenditures of million 
financing activity cash flows cash flows from financing activities were million in  compared to million in our financing activities for consist primarily of the october issuance of million in contingent convertible debentures 
the increase for was primarily a result of the proceeds from the december issuance of million contingent convertible debentures  offset by repayments of other long term borrowings 
expected future financing and investing cash requirements primarily depend on our acquisition activity and the related financing needs 
other sources of capital credit agreements during  we amended our million revolving credit agreement signed in october with bank of america  increasing the amount available for borrowing to million and allowing for more flexibility within certain debt covenants 
the revolving credit agreement comprises a million facility among euronet and certain us subsidiaries  and a million facility among euronet and certain european subsidiaries 
the revolving credit facilities have been  and can be  used to repay existing debt  for working capital needs  to make acquisitions or for other corporate purposes 
these agreements expire during october and contain customary events of default and covenants related to limitations on indebtedness and the maintenance of certain financial ratios 
we were in compliance with all covenants as of december  for more information regarding these facilities see note debt obligations to the consolidated financial statements 
as of december   we have borrowings of million  included in short term debt obligations in the consolidated balance sheet  and stand by letters of credit totaling million outstanding against our million revolving credit agreements  the remaining million was available for borrowing 
short term debt obligations short term obligations consist primarily of credit lines  overdraft facilities and short term loans to support atm cash needs and supplement short term working capital requirements 
as of december   and as mentioned above  we had million outstanding against our lines of credit 
we also incurred million in bank debt in connection with our fourth quarter acquisition of instreamline and million in borrowings by our subsidiaries in india  spain and the czech republic 
the borrowings in india  spain  the czech republic and on our lines of credit are being used to fund short term working capital requirements 
we believe that the short term debt obligations can be refinanced at terms acceptable to us 
however  if acceptable refinancing options are not available  we believe that amounts due under these obligations can be funded through cash generated from operations  together with cash on hand 
accounts receivable financed with recourse beginning in  our prepaid processing segment subsidiaries in spain entered into agreements with financial institutions to receive cash in advance of collections on customers accounts 
these arrangements can be with or without recourse and the financial institutions charge the spanish subsidiaries transaction fees and or interest in connection with these advances 
cash received can be up to days prior to the customer invoice due dates 
accordingly  the spanish subsidiaries remain obligated to the banks on the cash advances until the underlying account receivable is ultimately collected 
where the risk of collection remains with euronet  the receipt of cash continues to be carried on the consolidated balance sheet in each of trade accounts receivable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities 
as of december   we have million recorded under these arrangements 
convertible debt during october  we completed the sale of million in principal amount of convertible debentures due the net proceeds  after transaction fees totaling million  were million 
the million in transaction fees have been deferred and are being amortized over seven years  the term of the initial put option by the holders of the debentures 
the convertible debentures have an annual interest rate of and are convertible into a total of million shares of euronet common stock at a conversion price of per share upon the occurrence of certain events relating to the closing prices of euronet common stock exceeding certain thresholds for specified periods 
we will pay contingent interest  during any six month period commencing with the period from october  through april   and for each six month period thereafter from april to october or october to april  for which the average trading price of the debentures for the applicable five trading day period preceding such applicable interest period equals or exceeds of the principal amount of the debentures 
contingent interest will equal per annum of the average trading price of a debenture for such five trading day periods 
the debentures may not be redeemed for seven years but are redeemable at par at any time thereafter 
holders of the debentures have the option to require us to purchase their debentures at par on october   and  or upon a change in control of the company 
when due  these debentures can be settled in cash or euronet common stock  at our option  at predetermined conversion rates 
these terms and other material terms and conditions applicable to the convertible debentures are set forth in the indenture governing the debentures 
during december  we completed the sale of million in principal amount of convertible senior debentures due the net proceeds  after transaction fees totaling million  were million 
the million in transaction fees have been deferred and are being amortized over five years  the term of the initial put option by the holders of the debentures 
the convertible senior debentures have an interest rate of and are convertible into a total of million shares of euronet common stock at a conversion price of per share upon the occurrence of certain events relating to the closing prices of euronet common stock exceeding certain thresholds for specified periods 
we will pay contingent interest  during any six month period commencing with the period from december  through june   and for each six month period thereafter from june to december or december to june  for which the average trading price of the debentures for the applicable five trading day period preceding such applicable interest period equals or exceeds of the principal amount of the debentures 
contingent interest will equal per annum of the average trading price of a debenture for such five trading day periods 
the debentures may not be redeemed by for five years but are redeemable at any time thereafter at par 
holders of the debentures have the option to require us to purchase their debentures at par on december   and  and upon a change in control of the company 
when due  these debentures can be settled in cash or euronet common stock  at our option  at predetermined conversion rates 
these terms and other material terms and conditions applicable to the convertible senior debentures are set forth in the indenture governing the debentures 
these debentures are discussed further in note debt obligations to the consolidated financial statements 
proceeds from issuance of shares and other capital contributions in february  the company established a new qualified employee stock purchase plan espp and reserved  shares of common stock for purchase under the plan by employees through payroll deductions according to specific eligibility and participation requirements 
this plan qualifies as an employee stock purchase plan under section of the internal revenue code of offerings commence at the beginning of each quarter and expire at the end of the quarter 
under the plan  participating employees are granted options  which immediately vest and are automatically exercised on the final date of the respective offering period 
the exercise price of common stock options purchased is the lesser of of the fair market value as defined in the espp of the shares on the first day of each offering or the last day of each offering 
the options are funded by participating employees payroll deductions or cash payments 
during  we issued  shares at an average price of per share  resulting in proceeds to us of approximately million 
other uses of capital payment obligations related to acquisitions as provided in our share purchase agreement with the selling shareholders of transact  during the first quarter  we paid an earn out totaling million 
this payment was settled through the issuance of  shares of the company s common stock  valued at approximately million  and million approximately million in cash 
we also paid approximately million in the first quarter for the second payment in connection with the november acquisition of the movilcarga assets 
these payments were accrued as current liabilities as of december  we also have other potential contingent obligations estimated to total between million and million to the former owners of the net assets of movilcarga and dynamic telecom 
these obligations  certain of which may be settled through the issuance of our common stock  have not been recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements because the final amounts cannot be estimated beyond a reasonable doubt 
these potential obligations are discussed further in note acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements 
leases we lease atms and other property and equipment under capital lease arrangements that expire between and the leases bear interest between and per year 
as of december   we owed million under these capital lease arrangements 
the majority of these lease agreements are entered into in connection with long term outsourcing agreements where  generally  we purchase a bank s atms and simultaneously sell the atms to an entity related to the bank and lease back the atms for purposes of fulfilling the atm outsourcing agreement with the bank 
we fully recover the related lease costs from the bank under the outsourcing agreements 
generally  the leases may be canceled without penalty upon reasonable notice in the unlikely event the bank or we were to terminate the related outsourcing agreement 
we expect that  if terms were acceptable  we would acquire more atms from banks under such outsourcing and lease agreements 
capital expenditures and needs total cash capital expenditures for were million 
these capital expenditures were required largely for the upgrade of atms to meet europay  mastercard and visa emv requirements and micro chip card technology  the purchase of terminals for the prepaid processing segment and office and data center computer equipment and software 
in the prepaid processing segment  approximately  of the more than  pos devices that we operate are company owned  with the remaining terminals being operated as integrated cash register devices of our major retail customers or owned by the retailers 
as our prepaid processing segment expands  we will continue to add terminals in certain independent retail locations at a price of approximately per terminal 
we expect the proportion of owned terminals to total terminals operated to remain relatively constant 
we are required to maintain atm hardware for euronet owned atms and software for all atms in our network in accordance with certain regulations and mandates established by local country regulatory and administrative bodies as well as emv 
accordingly  we expect additional capital expenditures over the next few years to maintain compliance with these regulations and or mandates 
while we do not currently have plans to increase capital expenditures to expand our network of owned atms  we expect that if strategic opportunities were available to us  we would consider increasing future capital expenditures to expand this network in new or existing markets 
upgrades to our atm software and hardware were required in and continued into to meet emv mandates such as triple des data encryption standard and micro chip card technology for smart cards 
we completed a plan for implementation and delivery of the hardware and software modifications  the remaining capital expenditures necessary to complete these upgrade requirements are estimated to be approximately million to million 
total capital expenditures for are estimated to be approximately million to million  primarily for the purchase of atms to meet contractual requirements in poland and india  to purchase and install atms in future key under penetrated markets  the purchase of terminals for the prepaid processing segment and office and data center computer equipment and software 
we expect approximately million of the capital expenditures will be covered through capital leases in conjunction with atm outsourcing agreements where we already have signed agreements with banks 
the balance of these capital expenditures will be funded through cash generated from operations  together with cash on hand 
at current and projected cash flow levels  we anticipate that our cash generated from operations  together with cash on hand and amounts available under our recently amended revolving credit agreements and other existing financing  will be sufficient to meet our debt  leasing  acquisition earn out and capital expenditure obligations 
if our cash is insufficient to meet these obligations  we will seek to refinance our debt under terms acceptable to us 
however  we can offer no assurances that we would be able to obtain favorable terms for the refinancing of any of our debt or obligations 
contingencies as disclosed in note acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements  in november  we issued shares of our common stock to fletcher international  ltd 
fletcher and provided fletcher with the option to acquire additional shares under certain conditions 
in each of april and may  fletcher exercised its additional investment rights  of which was exercised in may and would result in a net share settlement to fletcher of  shares 
in november  fletcher delivered a revised notice of exercise of the remaining of its additional investment rights  claiming entitlement to  shares based upon the position that such exercise superseded the notice delivered in may we contested that revised notice and on december  issued fletcher  shares as provided in the earlier exercise 
in december  fletcher notified euronet that it considered euronet in breach of its obligations under the placement agreement creating the additional investment right 
during  we received confirmation from fletcher that it had decided not to litigate this matter 
during  we received a claim from a former cash supply contractor in central europe the contractor for approximately million in cash and interest that the contractor claims to have provided to us during the fourth quarter and first quarter this claim  based on events that purportedly occurred over five years ago  was filed more than a year after we had terminated our business with the contractor and established a cash supply agreement with another supplier 
the contractor has threatened  but not yet initiated  legal action regarding the claim 
management expects to prevail in defending itself in this matter and  accordingly no liability or expense has been recorded related to this claim 
we will continue to monitor and assess this claim until ultimate resolution 
from time to time  we are a party to litigation arising in the ordinary course of business 
currently  there are no other contingencies that we believe  either individually or in the aggregate  would have a material adverse effect upon our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
other trends and uncertainties euronet payments and remittance  inc with the acquisition of telecommusa  we established euronet payments and remittance  inc euronet payments and remittance 
in connection with the expected future expansion of our card based money transfer and bill payment product through our existing pos terminals  we expect to incur potentially significant costs for technical development and marketing 
through december   we have incurred approximately million in costs for this expansion  and expect to incur approximately million over the next months  most of which has been or will be capitalized and amortized over the assets estimated useful lives 
we also expect to incur operating losses exceeding million during related to our money transfer and bill payment business 
these losses may increase as we begin expanding the money transfer and bill payment products internationally 
euronet payments and remittance is consistent with our core business of transaction processing and we currently have over sending locations in the us to facilitate consumer remittances to approximately  distribution outlets in latin america 
we also offer bill payment services to approximately  us billers 
the card based system allows retailers to accept cash at a designated pos location and transfer it to any of the money transfer locations connected to the system 
the system is fast and easy to use for both retailers and consumers and is designed to verify transactions in compliance with all state and federal regulations  such as the office of foreign assets control ofac  bank secrecy act bsa  financial crimes enforcement network fincen and patriot act regulations 
transfers can be picked up in cash  deposited to a bank account  or loaded to a stored value card 
eft processing segment expansion in china in january  through jiayintong beijing technology development co 
ltd  our owned joint venture with ray holdings in china  we entered into an atm outsourcing pilot agreement with postal savings and remittance bureau psrb a financial institution located and organized in china 
under the pilot agreement we have agreed to deploy and provide all of the day to day outsourcing services for a total of atms in beijing  shanghai and guandong  the three largest commercial centers in china 
we expect these atms to become operational during the next several months 
if this pilot agreement meets certain success criteria  we have agreed to take over additional existing atms and install new atms  at psrb s request 
we have established a processing center in beijing to drive these atms 
during  the joint venture incurred approximately million in costs related to establishing this presence in china  million of which has been capitalized and will be depreciated over the assets estimated useful lives 
we expect the joint venture to incur a similar operating loss in china during prepaid processing agreements in spain during december  a wholesale customer of our prepaid processing segment subsidiaries in spain elected not to continue their relationship with us at revised terms that would have resulted in a lower margin for this customer 
the loss of this customer accounted for less than of our consolidated revenue 
additionally  when we acquired our spanish prepaid subsidiaries  we entered into agreements through may with a major mobile operator under which the subsidiaries received a preferred  exclusive distributor commission on sales of prepaid mobile airtime 
the preferential commission arrangements are set contractually to expire in may  and unless these arrangements are extended  the overall amount of commission we receive in spain will be reduced 
we are in discussions with the mobile operator to extend these special arrangements  but currently do not expect that they will be extended 
if we are not successful in extending the preferential commission rates  as allowed under our contracts with retailer  we expect to pass through a portion of our reduction in commission to the retailers by paying a lower distribution commission 
moreover  we are also in discussions with two other mobile operators to commence distribution of their prepaid phone time and expect commissions from the sale of their prepaid time to partially offset this reduction when distribution is implemented commencing in the second quarter essentis acquisition in january  we acquired the assets of essentis limited essentis  a uk company that owns a leading card issuing and merchant acquiring software package 
the assets  primarily consisting of the software package  were purchased out of an administration proceeding for approximately million  including the assumption of certain liabilities 
the essentis software product constitutes a significant addition to our outsourcing and software offerings to banks 
we expect essentis to generate an operating loss of approximately million for stock plans as discussed below under impact of new accounting pronouncements not yet adopted  beginning in january we are required to adopt statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment  which requires the determination of the fair value of the share based compensation at the grant date and the recognition of the related expense over the period in which the share based compensation vests 
sfas no 
r applies to awards issued after the date of adoption  as well as the unvested portion of awards issued before the date of adoption 
consistent with emerging corporate trends  the compensation committee of our board of directors has reconsidered the use of stock options as an element of long term management incentive compensation  and has decided to award restricted common stock rather than options to purchase our common stock 
during  the compensation committee approved the award of certain restricted shares to management and other key employees 
the awards represent a commitment to issue  shares of our common stock and will generally vest over periods ranging from three to seven years from the date of grant 
we recognized million during related to restricted share awards 
for  we estimate that the expense for these restricted share awards  together with additional stock based compensation expense for the unvested portion of stock options outstanding  will be approximately million 
inflation and functional currencies generally  the countries we operate in have experienced low and stable inflation in recent years 
therefore  the local currency in each of these markets is the functional currency 
although croatia has maintained relatively stable inflation and exchange rates  the functional currency of our croatian subsidiary is the us dollar due to the significant level of us dollar denominated revenues and expenses 
due to these factors  we do not believe that inflation will have a significant effect on our results of operations or financial position 
we continually review inflation and the functional currency in each of the countries where we operate 
off balance sheet arrangements we have certain significant off balance sheet items described below and in the following section  contractual obligations also see note guarantees to the consolidated financial statements 
as of december  we have million of bank guarantees issued on our behalf  of which million are collateralized by cash deposits held by the respective issuing banks

from time to time  euronet enters into agreements with unaffiliated parties that contain indemnification provisions  the terms of which may vary depending on the negotiated terms of each respective agreement 
the amount of such obligations is not stated in the agreements 
our liability under such indemnification provision may be subject to time and materiality limitations  monetary caps and other conditions and defenses 
such indemnity obligations include the following in connection with the license of proprietary systems to customers  we provide certain warranties and infringement indemnities to the licensee  which generally warrant that such systems do not infringe on intellectual property owned by third parties and that the systems will perform in accordance with their specifications 
we have entered into purchase and service agreements with our vendors and into consulting agreements with providers of consulting services  pursuant to which we have agreed to indemnify certain of such vendors and consultants  respectively  against third party claims arising from our use of the vendor s product or the services of the vendor or consultant

we have entered into agreements with certain third parties  including banks that provide fiduciary and other services to euronet or to our benefit plans 
under such agreements  we have agreed to indemnify such service providers for third party claims relating to the carrying out of their respective duties under such agreements 
in connection with our entry into the money transfer business  we have issued surety bonds in compliance with licensing requirements of those states 
to date  we are not aware of any significant claims made by the indemnified parties or parties to guarantee agreements with us and  accordingly  no liabilities have been recorded as of december  contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period less than more than in thousands total year years years years debt obligations  including interest estimated potential acquisition obligations capital leases operating leases short term debt obligations  including interest vendor purchase obligations total for the purposes of the above table  our million convertible debentures issued in december are considered due during  and our million convertible debentures issued in october are considered due during  representing the first years in which holders have the right to exercise their put option 
these debentures can be settled in cash or euronet common stock  at our option  at predetermined conversion rates 
additionally  the above table only includes interest on these convertible debentures up to the potential settlement dates 
for additional information on debt obligations  see note debt obligations to the consolidated financial statements 
the estimated potential acquisition obligations reflect additional consideration that we will have to pay during the years through in connection with the acquisitions of movilcarga  dynamic telecom and europlanet 
this additional consideration is based on the achievement of certain performance criteria 
when determined beyond a reasonable doubt  we will record these additional payments  if any  as goodwill 
we can offer no assurances that we will be able to generate sufficient cash from operations or obtain financing to meet remaining our obligations when due

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain and for which the actual results will emerge over time 
these judgments  assumptions and estimates affect the amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note summary of significant accounting policies and practices to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
our most critical estimates and assumptions are used for computing income taxes  estimating the useful lives and potential impairment of long lived assets and goodwill  as well as allocating the purchase price to assets acquired in acquisitions 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the following descriptions of critical accounting policies and estimates are forward looking statements and are impacted significantly by estimates and should be read in conjunction with item a risk factors 
actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated by these forward looking statements 
accounting for income taxes the deferred income tax effects of transactions reported in different periods for financial reporting and income tax return purposes are recorded under the liability method 
this method gives consideration to the future tax consequences of deferred income or expense items and immediately recognizes changes in income tax laws upon enactment 
the income statement effect is generally derived from changes in deferred income taxes  net of valuation allowances  on the balance sheet as measured by differences in the book and tax bases of our assets and liabilities 
we have significant tax loss carryforwards  and other temporary differences  which are recorded as deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets realizable in future periods are recorded net of a valuation allowance based on an assessment of each entity s  or group of entities  ability to generate sufficient taxable income within an appropriate period  in a specific tax jurisdiction 
in assessing the recognition of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
as more fully described in note taxes to the consolidated financial statements  gross deferred tax assets were million as of december   substantially offset by a valuation allowance of million 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
we make judgments and estimates on the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  historical and projected future taxable income in each country in which we operate  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
based upon the level of historical taxable income and current projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible  we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of these deductible differences  net of the existing valuation allowance at december  if we have a history of generating taxable income in a certain country in which we operate  and baseline forecasts project continued taxable income in this country  we will reduce the valuation allowance for those deferred tax assets that we expect to realize 
goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations  the company allocates the purchase price of its acquisitions to the tangible assets  liabilities and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values 
the excess purchase price over those fair values is recorded as goodwill 
the fair value assigned to intangible assets acquired is supported by valuations using estimates and assumptions provided by management 
for larger or more complex acquisitions  management engaged an appraiser to assist in the evaluation 
intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
as of december   the company s consolidated balance sheet includes goodwill of million  of which relates to the company s prepaid processing segment  and acquired intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization  of million  of which relates to prepaid processing segment 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  on an annual basis  and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired  the company is required to identify and determine the carrying value of its reporting units  by assigning assets and liabilities  including goodwill and intangible assets 
impairment tests are performed annually during the fourth quarter and are performed at the reporting unit level 
generally  fair value represents discounted projected future cash flows and potential impairment is indicated when the carrying value of a reporting unit  including goodwill  exceeds its estimated fair value 
if the potential for impairment exists  the fair value of the reporting unit is subsequently measured against the fair value of its underlying assets and liabilities  excluding goodwill  to estimate an implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill over the implied fair value 
the company s annual impairment tests during  and indicated that there were no impairments 
estimating the future cash flows of our reporting units requires significant judgment 
if future cash flows do not materialize as expected  or there is a future adverse change in market conditions  the company may be unable to recover the carrying amount of an asset  resulting in future impairment losses 
impairment or disposal of long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  long lived assets  such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
factors that are considered important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of the company s use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the respective asset 
the same estimates are also used in planning for our long and short range business planning and forecasting 
we assess the reasonableness of the inputs and outcomes of our discounted cash flow analysis against available comparable market data 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the respective asset 
assets to be disposed are required to be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell  and are no longer depreciated 
the assets and liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale are required to be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet 
reviewing long lived assets for impairment requires considerable judgment 
estimating the future cash flows requires significant judgment 
if future cash flows do not materialize as expected or there is a future adverse change in market conditions  the company may be unable to recover the carrying amount of an asset  resulting in future impairment losses 
balance sheet items cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents increased to million at december  from million at december  this increase is due to cash flows from operating activities of million and cash flows from financing activities of million  offset by cash used for investing activities of million and the effect of exchange differences on cash of million 
cash flows from financing activities primarily represent proceeds from our october issuance of million in contingent convertible debentures 
cash flows used in investing activities primarily represent expenditures related to acquisitions of million 
for more information  see the consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended december  and restricted cash restricted cash increased slightly to million at december  from million at december   and primarily represents million held in trust and or cash held on behalf of others in connection with the administration of the customer collection and vendor remittance activities in the prepaid processing segment 
amounts collected from customers that are due to the mobile operators are deposited into a restricted cash account held by our prepaid processing segment subsidiaries on behalf of the mobile operators for which we process transactions 
these balances are used in connection with the administration of customer collection and vendor remittance activities and can fluctuate significantly based on the timing of the settlement process at our prepaid processing segment subsidiaries 
the remaining balances of restricted cash represent primarily collateral on bank guarantees and atm network cash 
inventory pins and other inventory pins and other increased to million at december  from million at december  inventory pins and other includes prepaid personal identification number pin inventory for prepaid mobile airtime purchases related to the prepaid processing segment  primarily in the us  poland and new zealand  and to a lesser extent  the us and germany 
this category also includes smaller amounts for pos terminals  mobile phone handsets and atms held for sale 
the increase from december  is due to the accelerated growth of prepaid processing in the us  poland and new zealand and timing of bulk pin purchases in poland and the us we generally sell our pin inventory within a very short timeframe  thereby limiting our exposure to overall reductions in the market value of pins or other obsolescence issues 
trade accounts receivable  net net trade accounts receivables increased to million at december  from million at december  the primary component of our trade accounts receivable represents amounts to be collected on behalf of mobile operators for the full value of the prepaid mobile airtime sold in connection with the growing prepaid processing segment 
generally  these balances are collected and remitted to the mobile operators within two weeks 
the growth over the prior year is primarily due to the timing of the settlement process  acquisitions and overall growth in the prepaid processing segment 
prepaid expenses and other current assets prepaid expenses and other current assets increased to million as of december  from million as of december  the largest component of this balance is amounts recorded for our net value added tax vat receivable related to certain european subsidiaries 
the balance of net vat receivable as of december  was million  compared to million as of december  this increase of million was net of a refund of million during the third quarter and is primarily a result of the acquisition of telerecarga in march this balance also includes amounts due from distributors for prepaid mobile airtime sold at the end of the year but not invoiced until  primarily at our subsidiaries in australia  new zealand and germany 
this balance increased by million compared to the prior year 
the remaining increase of million is due to overall increases in operational levels and the timing of payments such as insurance  deposits and other prepaid items 
property and equipment  net net property and equipment increased to million as of december  from million at december  of this increase  approximately million is due to our acquisitions 
an additional million in atms were purchased or added under capital lease arrangements during  primarily in our growing markets in india and poland 
we added million in pos terminals in the prepaid processing segment  mainly in the us market  but also in the us  poland and germany 
additions of office and computer equipment and computer software totaled million and were incurred across all of our entities to support growth  particularly at our processing center in hungary  our prepaid processing business in the us and our recently completed processing center in china 
these additions were offset by depreciation and amortization expense of million and million in other reductions  such as the impact of fluctuations in exchange rates relative to the us dollar during goodwill and acquired intangible assets  net net intangible assets and goodwill increased to million at december  from million at december  due primarily to our acquisitions 
additionally  independent appraisals for transact and movilcarga adjusted the preliminary purchase price allocations and resulted in an increase to the amount recorded for amortizable intangible assets of million and a decrease to goodwill of million  after the impact of deferred income taxes 
amortization of intangible assets for was million 
the following table summarizes the goodwill and intangible activity for the years ended december  and amortizable total intangible intangible in thousands assets goodwill assets balance as of january  increases decreases acquisition of movilcarga other acquisitions additional purchase price related to transact additional purchase price related to aim amortization other primarily changes in foreign currency exchange rates balance as of december  increases decreases acquisition of telerecarga other acquisitions adjustment to transact purchase price allocation adjustment to movilcarga purchase price allocation amortization other primarily changes in foreign currency exchange rates balance as of december  other assets other assets increased to million at december  from million at december  this increase was due to capitalized deferred financing costs of million  a net increase of million in our investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries  primarily for our share of e pay malaysia s earnings  million in due diligence costs for potential acquisitions  capitalized research and development cost of million and an increase of million in long term security deposits for atm sites in india 
capitalized deferred financing costs consist primarily of million in costs incurred in connection with our october issuance of million in contingent convertible debentures 
partially offsetting these increases were million in amortization of deferred financing and capitalized research and development costs and million included in other assets as of december  for our investment in atx 
during we exercised our option to acquire an additional interest in atx and  accordingly  are required to consolidate atx s financial position and results from operations 
therefore  this million investment is not included in other assets as of december  trade accounts payable accounts payable increased to million at december  from million at december  the primary component of our trade accounts payable represents payables to mobile operators in connection with the timing of the settlement process for the growing prepaid processing segment 
of the total increase  million relates to telerecarga  a prepaid processing subsidiary in spain that was acquired during and million relates to more favorable payment terms and amounts due at the end of the year for bulk pin purchases in the us the remaining million increase is due to overall growth in our prepaid processing segment and the timing of the settlement process with mobile operators 
accrued expenses and other current liabilities accrued expenses and other current liabilities decreased to million at december  from million at december  this million decrease is primarily due to the settlement of the million and million purchase price liabilities for the transact earn out and movilcarga acquisition  respectively  that were accrued as of december  these decreases were partially offset by million in liabilities related to our acquisitions  million in liabilities related to accounts receivable financed with recourse by our subsidiaries in spain and million in accrued interest relating to our october contingent convertible debentures 
the remaining increase of million is due to the timing of the settlement process with mobile operators in our prepaid processing segment  primarily in australia and new zealand  and the recognition and payment of various accrued expenses and other current liabilities across all of our operations 
short term debt obligations short term debt obligations increased to million at december  from million at december  this increase is due to million outstanding against our lines of credit  million in bank debt incurred related to our fourth quarter acquisition of instreamline and million in additional borrowings by our subsidiaries in india and spain 
the borrowings in india  spain and on our lines of credit are being used to fund short term working capital requirements 
deferred revenue deferred revenue decreased to million as of december  from million as of december  due to difference in timing of cash receipts and revenue recognition for certain contracts  primarily related to atm outsourcing in india 
long term debt obligations as of december   long term debt obligations increased to million from million as of december  due to our october issuance of million in contingent convertible debentures 
a summary of the activity for the year ended december  and is as follows senior convertible convertible acquisition discount notes due debentures due debentures due in thousands indebtedness june total balance at january  increases decreases indebtedness incurred repayments foreign exchange loss balance at december  increases indebtedness incurred balance at december  for further information  see note debt obligations to the consolidated financial statements 
capital lease obligations in connection with certain long term outsourcing agreements  we lease many of our atms under capital lease arrangements where  generally  we purchase a bank s atms and simultaneously sell the atms to an entity related to the bank and lease back the atms for purposes of fulfilling the atm outsourcing agreement with the bank 
we generally recover the related lease costs from the bank under the outsourcing agreements 
our total capital lease obligations decreased to million at december  from million at december  due to payments and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar 
deferred income tax liabilities current and non current deferred tax liabilities totaled million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
the increase of million was due to million of additions to deferred tax liabilities in connection with our acquisitions and million in additions related to an adjustment to the value of transact and movilcarga s amortizable intangible assets 
these increases were partially offset by amortization of acquisition related deferred taxes 
total stockholders equity total stockholders equity increased to million at december  from million at december  this million increase is primarily the result of million in net income for the year ended december   million in shares issued for acquisitions  million from stock issued under employee stock plans and other  offset by million increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss  net of a million decrease related to reclassification to net income of the cumulative translation adjustment that had previously been recorded as a component accumulated other comprehensive income due to the prior years consolidation of the france operations 
impact of new and emerging accounting pronouncements not yet adopted in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment  which is a revision of the sfas no 
and supersedes apb opinion no 
sfas no 
r requires the determination of the fair value of the share based compensation at the grant date and the recognition of the related expense over the period in which the share based compensation vests requisite service period 
sfas no 
r permits prospective application or retrospective application under which financial statements for prior periods are adjusted on a basis consistent with the pro forma disclosures originally required for those periods by the original sfas no 
after amendment of the compliance date by the securities and exchange commission during april  the company is required to adopt the provisions of sfas no 
r as of january  we plan to adopt the requirements of sfas no 
r using the retrospective application method and  accordingly  will restate all prior years for which sfas no 
was effective 
management expects the impact of adopting sfas no 
r to approximate amounts disclosed in note k significant accounting policies stock based compensation  to the consolidated financial statements 
as a result of restating prior years  our us federal and state net operating loss carryforwards  reported for us gaap purposes  will increase 
however  since we provide a valuation allowance over our entire us net deferred tax assets  upon adoption of sfas no 
r  the amount of net deferred tax assets is not expected to change 
management expects to use the black scholes pricing model for the determination of fair value for future stock option grants 
the amount of future compensation expense related to awards of performance based restricted shares will be based on the share price at the grant date 
management does not expect the adoption of sfas no 
r to have a significant impact on the company s overall financial position 
share based compensation expense will be recognized as a corporate expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
during  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an exposure draft that would amend statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations 
the proposed changes include  among other things recording contingent liabilities including earn out obligations at estimated value at the acquisition date  with subsequent adjustments being recorded in net income  rather than as an adjustment to goodwill  and accounting for transaction related costs as expenses in the period incurred  rather than capitalizing these costs as a component of the respective purchase price 
the fasb has received comment letters regarding the proposed amendment and is beginning redeliberations  which are expected to take approximately one year 
the fasb expects to issue the final statement during the first half of and a revised expected effective date has not yet been published 
if adopted  as set forth in the exposure draft  the changes would likely have a significant impact on the accounting treatment for acquisitions occurring after the effective date 
during  the fasb issued an exposure draft  accounting for uncertain tax positions  a proposed interpretation of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the proposed interpretation would have required that the sustainability of tax positions achieve a probable level  similar to the assessment of contingent liabilities prescribed in sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  before being recorded as a reduction to income tax expense 
the comment period ended in september and the fasb has announced that it expects to issue the final interpretation during the first quarter we will evaluate the impact that the adoption of the final interpretation may have on euronet  however  the impact may be significant 
it is expected that we will be required to adopt this amendment beginning january  forward looking statements this document contains statements that constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act and section e of the us securities exchange act of  as amended 
all statements other than statements of historical facts included in this document are forward looking statements  including statements regarding the following our business plans and financing plans and requirements  trends affecting our business plans and financing plans and requirements  trends affecting our business  the adequacy of capital to meet our capital requirements and expansion plans  the assumptions underlying our business plans  business strategy  government regulatory action  technological advances  or projected costs and revenues 
although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  we can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct 
forward looking statements are typically identified by the words believe  expect  anticipated  intend  estimate and similar expressions 
investors are cautioned that any forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to  those referred to above and as set forth in item a risk factors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk as of december   we do not have significant exposure to interest rate volatility 
of the total outstanding debt of million  approximately relates contingent convertible debentures having fixed coupon rates 
our million contingent convertible debentures  issued in october  accrue interest at a rate of per annum 
the million contingent convertible debentures  issued in december  accrue interest at a rate of per annum 
interest expense  including amortization of deferred debt issuance costs  for these contingent convertible debentures is expected to total approximately million per year  or a weighted average interest rate of annually 
the remaining of total debt outstanding relates to short term debt obligations with a weighted average interest rate of as of december  and capitalized leases with fixed payment and interest terms that expire between and we also have million in revolving credit facilities that accrue interest at variable rates 
should we borrow the full million available under the revolving credit facility  in addition to approximately million borrowed under other short term debt arrangements as of december   and maintain the balance for a full year  a increase in the applicable interest rate would result in additional interest expense to the company of approximately million 
for more information  see note debt obligations to the consolidated financial statements 
foreign exchange exposure for the year ended december   of our total revenues were generated in non us dollar countries compared to in and in this slight decrease as compared to prior years is due to increased revenues of our us based prepaid processing segment operations 
we expect to continue generating a significant portion of our revenues in countries with currencies other than the us dollar 
we are particularly vulnerable to fluctuations in exchange rates of the us dollar to the euro  australian dollar  hungarian forint  polish zloty  the british pound and the indian rupee and estimate that a depreciation in these foreign currency exchange rates would have the combined effect on reported net income and working capital of a million decrease 
a appreciation in these foreign currency exchange rates would have the combined effect on reported net income and working capital of a million increase 
this effect was estimated by segregating revenues  expenses and working capital by currency and applying a currency depreciation and appreciation to the non us dollar amounts 
we believe this quantitative measure has inherent limitations and does not take into account any governmental actions or changes in either customer purchasing patterns or our financing or operating strategies 
as a result of continued european economic convergence  including the increased influence of the euro as opposed to the us dollar on the central european currencies  we expect that the currencies of the markets where we invest will fluctuate less against the euro and the british pound than against the dollar 
we are also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk in our money transfer service that was launched during this portion of our business is currently insignificant  however  we expect that it will grow rapidly 
a majority of this business involves receiving and disbursing different currencies  in which we receive a foreign currency spread based on the difference between buying currency at wholesale exchange rates and selling the currency to consumers at retail exchange rates 
this spread provides some protection against currency fluctuations that occur while we are holding the foreign currency 
additionally  our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates is limited by the fact that disbursement occurs for the majority of transactions shortly after they are initiated
