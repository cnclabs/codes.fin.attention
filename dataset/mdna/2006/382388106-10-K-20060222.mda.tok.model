item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements 
see forward looking information is subject to risk and uncertainty for a discussion of certain of the uncertainties  risks and assumptions associated with these statements 
our former jcair inc 
test systems  avionics  and passenger restraint systems prs businesses have been accounted for as discontinued operations 
unless otherwise noted herein  disclosures pertain only to our continuing operations 
overview we are one of the largest worldwide suppliers of aerospace components  systems and services to the commercial and general aviation airplane markets 
we are also a leading supplier of systems and products to the global defense and space markets 
our business is conducted globally with manufacturing  service and sales undertaken in various locations throughout the world 
our products and services are principally sold to customers in north america  europe and asia 
key market channels for products and services  growth drivers and industry and our highlights we participate in three key market channels commercial and general aviation airplane original equipment oe  commercial and general aviation airplane aftermarket  and defense and space 
we expect industry wide growth in each of these market channels for the next several years  and we expect to participate in this growth 
commercial and general aviation airplane oe commercial and general aviation airplane oe includes sales to airbus and boeing  as well as to regional  business and small airplane manufacturers 
the key growth drivers in this market channel include the number of orders for new airplanes  which will be delivered to the manufacturers customers over a period of several years  oe manufacturer production and delivery rates and introductions of new airplane models such as the boeing and the airbus a and a airplanes 
during  orders for airbus and boeing commercial airplanes were at record levels  with many of the orders for deliveries beyond while orders for regional airplanes were not nearly as strong in as those for the larger airplanes  the unfilled backlog of orders remained substantial 
orders for general aviation airplanes  including business jets  continued to be strong 
we have significant sales content on most of the airplanes manufactured in this market channel 
during  we benefited from increased production rates and deliveries of airbus and boeing airplanes and from our substantial content on many of the more popular regional and general aviation airplanes 
we were also awarded several new contracts for our products on airplanes currently in a pre production stage  including the airbus a and the boeing  which should provide substantial future sales growth for us 
commercial and general aviation airplane aftermarket the commercial and general aviation airplane aftermarket channel includes sales of products and services for existing commercial and general aviation airplanes  primarily to airlines and freight forwarders around the world 
the key growth drivers in this channel include worldwide passenger capacity growth measured by available seat miles asm and the size of the airplane fleet 
other important factors affecting growth in this market channel are the age of the airplanes in the fleet and gross domestic product gdp trends in countries and regions around the world 
we estimate that capacity in the global airline system  as measured by asms  grew at about to percent during we expect asms to continue to grow at about percent annually in through it is expected that the global airplane fleet will continue to grow in and beyond  as the oe manufacturers deliver more airplanes than are retired 
we have significant product content on most of the airplane models that are currently in service 
sales of our products and services in this market channel experienced strong growth in  and we expect growth to continue in and beyond 
we have benefited from good growth in asms  especially in asia  as well as the aging of the worldwide fleet of airplanes 
defense and space worldwide defense and space sales include sales to prime contractors such as boeing  northrop grumman  lockheed martin  the us government and foreign companies and governments 
the key growth drivers in this channel include the level of defense spending by the us and foreign governments  the number of new platform starts  the level of military flight operations and the level of upgrade  overhaul and maintenance activities associated with existing platforms 
during  the industry continued to experience strong growth in support of new platforms under development  such as the f raptor and the f jsf  as well as significant growth in requirements for upgrade and overhaul and maintenance activities on many existing platforms  such as the c globemaster iii  f super hornet and several helicopter programs 
additionally  the industry experienced rapid growth for programs associated with homeland defense and surveillance and reconnaissance missions 
the market for our defense and space products is global  and is not dependent on any single program  platform or customer 
while we anticipate fewer new platform starts over the next several years  which are expected to negatively affect defense and space oe sales  we anticipate that upgrades on existing platforms will be necessary  and will provide long term growth in this market channel 
additionally  we are participating in  and developing new products for  the rapidly expanding homeland defense and surveillance and reconnaissance markets  which should further strengthen our position in this market channel 
long term sustainable growth in our key market channels we have received awards for key products on several new and emerging programs  including the airbus a and a  the boeing  the embraer  the dassault falcon x and the lockheed martin f jsf and f raptor  which should fuel consistent  long term sustainable growth 
with these awards  we have improved our market presence and increased the expected sales dollar content per aircraft in this segment of the market 
as the industry moves beyond the current upcycle  we should be well positioned to continue to grow our commercial aftermarket and defense and space sales due to significantly larger commercial airplane fleet  which should fuel aftermarket strength  balance in the large commercial airplane market  with strong sales to both airbus and boeing  aging of the existing airbus and regional and business airplane fleets  which should result in increased aftermarket support  increased number of long term agreements for product sales on new and existing commercial airplanes  increased opportunities for aftermarket growth due to airline outsourcing  and expansion of our product offerings in support of high growth areas in the defense and space market channel 
sales content by market channel during the year ended december   percent of our sales were from our three primary market channels described above 
following is a summary of the percentage of sales by market channel year ended december  airbus commercial oe boeing commercial oe regional and general aviation airplane oe total commercial and general aviation airplane oe large commercial airplane aftermarket regional and general aviation airplane aftermarket heavy airplane maintenance total commercial and general aviation airplane aftermarket total defense and space other total summary performance change dollars in millions  except diluted eps sales segment operating income of sales income from continuing operations net income capital expenditures net cash provided by operating activities diluted eps continuing operations net income our sales and income performance was driven primarily by rapid sales growth in all of our market channel large commercial airplane oe sales increased percent  with sales to airbus increasing by more than percent  regional and general aviation airplane oe sales increased by percent  led by strong sales growth for our aerostructures products  commercial and general aviation airplane aftermarket sales increased by percent  with continued strong sales of our aerostructures products and services and strong growth in our airplane heavy maintenance services  and defense and space sales of both oe and aftermarket products and services increased by about percent 
strong defense and space sales growth in the electronic systems segment was the primary driver in this market channel 
net income during the years ended december  and were also impacted by the following net cumulative catch up charges of million million after tax  or per diluted share as compared to net cumulative catch up charges of million million after tax  or  per diluted share in the year ended december  related to changes in cost estimates on contracts in our aerostructures business 
a charge in of million million after tax  or per diluted share related to the termination of the boeing ng spoiler contract 
restructuring and consolidation charges of million million after tax  or per diluted share during the year ended december  as compared to million million after tax  or per diluted share during the year ended december  the absence in of million million after tax  or per diluted share of charges recorded during the year ended december  as a result of the partial settlement with northrop grumman on claims related to the aeronautical systems acquisition 
reserves for the a actuation system of million million after tax  or per diluted share for a retrofit of redesigned parts and including reserves for related obsolete inventory  supplier claims and impaired assets recorded during the year ended december  premiums and costs associated with the early retirement of long term debt totaling million million after tax  or per diluted share during the year ended december   as compared to million million  or per diluted share during the year ended december  our effective tax rate from continuing operations was percent during the year ended december  as compared to percent during the year ended december  the increase in our effective tax rate resulted from us income tax associated with dividends from certain foreign subsidiaries pursuant to the american job creation act  growth in before tax book income relative to our significant permanent items  the phase in of the american jobs creation act  which replaces certain export sales deductions with a deduction for income from qualified domestic production activities  and the absence of favorable state and foreign tax settlements  offset in part by additional reserves for certain income tax issues 
income from discontinued operations  after tax  was million during the year ended december  and included the million after tax gain on the sale of test systems which was sold during the second quarter of  and a million after tax gain recognized as a result of our settlement with several insurers relating to the recovery of past costs to remediate environmental issues at a former chemical plant during the fourth quarter of effective january   we changed two aspects of the application of contract accounting for our aerostructures business which resulted in a million after tax gain million before tax  or per diluted share that was recorded as a cumulative effect of change in accounting in the first quarter cash flow from operations for the year ended december  was million as compared to million for the year full year cash flow from operations included contributions of million to our worldwide pension plans  compared to contributions of million in cash flow from operations in included million from the partial settlement with northrop grumman related to the acquisition of aeronautical systems  which did not recur during capital expenditures were million for the year  as compared to million for the year outlook we expect the following results for the year ending december  outlook actual sales billion billion diluted eps continuing operations per share per share diluted eps net income per share per share capital expenditures million million operating cash flow net of capital expenditures of income from continuing operations of income from continuing operations our outlook is based on the following market assumptions we expect deliveries of airbus and boeing large commercial airplane to increase by more than percent in  and by a somewhat lesser amount in our sales of large commercial airplane oe products are projected to increase by to percent in this expected growth rate is lower than the growth rate in aircraft deliveries because many of our products are delivered well in advance of manufacturers deliveries to their customers  which caused sales to occur in for planes to be delivered well into capacity in the global airline system  as measured by asms  is expected to continue to grow at about percent in  compared to our sales to airlines and package carriers for commercial airplane aftermarket parts and services are expected to grow at a slightly faster rate of approximately to percent in as compared to total regional and business airplane production is expected to be flat or slightly down in  compared to  as deliveries of business jets are expected to increase  partially offsetting the expected decrease in regional airplane deliveries 
deliveries to embraer in support of its embraer airplane  which includes a significant amount of our content  are expected to enable us to increase our oe sales in this market channel for the year by approximately percent  compared to defense sales oe and aftermarket are expected to be relatively flat to slightly down in  compared to sales for the c reliability enhancement and re engining program are expected to temporarily decrease in and sales of military aftermarket products are also expected to decline in the customer services business 
these decreases are expected to be largely offset by strong growth in the sales of military and space products in our electronic systems segment 
the outlook includes significant increases in costs associated with pension expense  foreign exchange and stock based compensation 
the pension expense assumptions reflect the january  discount rates  actuarial assumptions and asset values 
these items are more fully discussed below pension expense based on pension assumptions as of january   we expect to incur additional pension expense of approximately million before tax million after tax  or per diluted share during  compared to this expectation is based on a discount rate assumption of percent for the us plans and includes the benefit of voluntary contributions to our us plans during foreign exchange we are currently about percent hedged for our expected foreign exchange exposure 
based on these hedges and current market conditions  we expect that foreign currency translation related to sales and expenses denominated in currencies other than the us dollar will have an unfavorable impact of approximately million before tax million after tax  or per diluted share during as gains from hedges maturing in will be less than gains realized in stock based compensation on january   we implemented fas  prospectively  and a new stock option and restricted stock unit program 
the cost of each annual restricted stock unit grant is amortized over a five year vesting period 
consequently  expense increases year over year as each new restricted stock unit grant is added 
also  under the provisions of fas r  beginning in we will recognize the value of stock options and restricted stock units granted to all employees who are  or who become  eligible for retirement on an accelerated basis 
in total  these items are expected to result in an increase in stock based compensation expense of approximately million before tax million after tax  or per diluted share during the current sales  net income and cash flow from operations outlook for does not include an estimate for the impact of resolution of the rohr and coltec tax litigation  additional acquisitions or divestitures  an estimate for the impact of resolution of potential remaining a contractual disputes with northrop grumman relating to the airbus a program  or planned changes to our us defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans 
results of operations changes in accounting methods effective january   we changed two aspects of the application of contract accounting to preferable methods for our aerostructures business  which is included in the engine systems segment 
the first is a change to the cumulative catch up method from the reallocation method for accounting for changes in contract estimates of revenue and costs 
the change was effected by adjusting contract profit rates from the balance to complete gross profit rate to the estimated gross profit rate at completion of the contract 
the second change related to pre certification costs 
under the old policy  pre certification costs exceeding the level anticipated in our original investment model used to negotiate contractual terms were expensed when determined regardless of overall contract profitability 
under the new policy  pre certification costs  including those in excess of original estimated levels  are included in total contract costs used to evaluate overall contract profitability 
the impact of the changes in accounting method was to record a million after tax gain million before tax gain as a cumulative effect of change in accounting 
had these methods of accounting been in effect during  the segment operating income as previously reported for the engine systems segment  as well as our total operating income for the year ended december   would have been million lower 
also effective january   we changed our method of accounting for stock based compensation 
we previously accounted for stock based compensation under apb no 
we adopted the provisions of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 
and financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 

as such  we expense stock options and the discount and option value of shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan 
the expense is recognized over the period the stock options and shares are earned and vest 
the adoption of fasb no 
reduced before tax income by million million after tax  per diluted share for the year ended december  during the year ended december   before tax income was reduced by million million before tax  per diluted share 
the us medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of the medicare act was signed into law on december  effective with the second quarter  we adopted retroactively to january   the financial accounting standards board staff position no 
fas  accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of 
the effect of the medicare act was measured as of january  and is reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
the effect of the medicare act was a million reduction of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for our retiree benefit plans as well as a reduction in the net periodic postretirement benefit cost 
the effect of the reduction in net periodic postretirement benefit cost was an increase to before tax income from continuing operations of million million after tax for the year ended december  partial settlement with northrop grumman during the fourth quarter  we entered into a million partial settlement agreement with northrop grumman  as successor to trw  relating to our acquisition of trw s aeronautical systems businesses in october the partial settlement agreement primarily relates to customer warranty and other contract claims for products that were designed  manufactured or sold by trw prior to our purchase of aeronautical systems 
under the terms of the settlement  we have assumed certain liabilities associated with future customer warranty and other contract claims for these products 
the settlement excluded amounts associated with any claims that we may have against northrop grumman relating to the airbus actuation systems development program and certain other liabilities retained by trw under the acquisition agreement 
as a result of the partial settlement in  we recorded a liability for the estimated undiscounted future liabilities of million that we assumed 
we recorded a charge of million to cost of sales representing the amount by which our estimated undiscounted future liabilities plus our receivable from northrop grumman for these matters exceeded the settlement amount 
the charge is reflected in the applicable segments operating income

corporate general and administrative costs of million for the year ended december  decreased million  or percent  from million for the year ended december  primarily due to lower tax litigation costs and lower information technology costs  partially offset by higher incentive compensation costs 
corporate general and administrative costs as a percentage of sales were percent in the year ended december  and percent in the year ended december  net interest expense of million in the year ended december  decreased million  or percent from million in the year ended december   primarily due to lower debt levels in other income expense net decreased by million  or percent  to expense of million in the year ended december  from expense of million in the year ended december  the decrease in expense resulted primarily from the absence in of a million impairment of a note receivable that was recorded during and lower expenses related to divested operations of million 
premiums and associated costs related to the early retirement of debt totaled million during the year ended december  and million during the year ended december  our effective tax rate from continuing operations was percent during the year ended december  and percent during the year ended december  the increase in our effective tax rate resulted from us income tax associated with dividends from certain foreign subsidiaries  growth in before tax book income relative to our significant permanent items  the phase in of the american jobs creation act  which replaces certain export sales deductions with a deduction for income from qualified domestic production activities  and the absence of favorable state and foreign tax settlements  offset in part by additional reserves for certain income tax issues 
income from discontinued operations  after tax  was million during the year ended december  primarily included the million gain  from the sale of the test systems  which was sold during the second quarter of income from discontinued operations for test systems included net income of million in the year ended december  and net income of million in the year ended december  income from discontinued operations also included a million gain recognized as a result of our settlement with several insurers relating to the recovery of past costs to remediate environmental issues at a former chemical plant

business segment performance our operations are reported as three business segments airframe systems  engine systems and electronic systems 
an analysis of net customer sales and operating income by business segment follows 
in the following tables  segment operating income is total segment revenue reduced by operating expenses directly identifiable with that business segment 
year ended december  compared with the year ended december  year ended december  of sales change dollars in millions net customer sales airframe systems engine systems electronic systems total sales segment operating income airframe systems engine systems electronic systems segment operating income airframe systems airframe systems segment sales of  million for the year ended december  increased million  or percent  from  million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to higher commercial and general aviation oe  commercial and general aviation aftermarket and defense and space sales volume in our landing gear business  higher sales of airframe heavy maintenance services  higher commercial and general aviation aftermarket and defense and space sales volume in our aircraft wheels and brakes business  and higher large commercial oe and aftermarket sales volume in our actuation systems business 
the increases in sales volume were partially offset by a decrease in regional and general aviation aftermarket sales volume in our actuation systems business 
airframe systems segment operating income decreased million  or percent  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increased volume from sales described above was more than offset by the following reserves of million for the a actuation system for a retrofit of redesigned parts  including reserves for related obsolete inventory  supplier claims and impaired assets  higher operating costs including the impacts of premium freight  higher scrap and rework  and higher warranty expenses in the landing gear business  unfavorable foreign currency translation on non us dollar denominated net costs in the actuation systems and landing gear businesses  higher product upgrade expenses in the aircraft wheels and brakes business  the absence of a million benefit from the revision of the accounting treatment of a technology development grant from a non us government entity  which was recognized during  higher research and development expenditures in the aircraft wheels and brakes business including expenditures for the development of the boeing and global hawk wheel and brake systems  and higher restructuring expenses in the actuation systems business 
partially offsetting the higher operating costs was the impact of lower research and development expenditures for the a actuation system  and the absence of a million charge for the partial settlement with northrop grumman on claims related to the aeronautical systems acquisition  which was recorded in engine systems engine systems segment sales of  million in the year ended december  increased million  or percent  from  million in the year ended december  the increase was due to the following higher commercial and general aviation airplane oe and aftermarket and maintenance  repair and overhaul mro sales volume  partially offset by a decline in defense sales volume in our aerostructures business  higher revenues in our customer services business from defense and space and regional and general aviation aftermarket support  higher sales volume of turbine fuel engine components and turbomachinery products for us military and regional and general aviation airplane applications and industrial gas turbine products  and higher sales volume of commercial and general aviation airplane oe and aftermarket  partially offset by a decline in defense and space sales volume in our engine control businesses 
engine systems segment operating income increased million  or percent  from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  segment operating income was higher due to higher sales volume as described above  income from cumulative catch up adjustments resulting from reduced cost estimates on several contracts in our aerostructures business  the absence of a million charge for the partial settlement with northrop grumman on claims related to the aeronautical systems acquisition  which was recorded in  and improved margins due to higher aftermarket sales  primarily for aerostructures products 
the increase in engine systems segment operating income was partially offset by cumulative catch up charges resulting from significant increased cost estimates primarily on two contracts in our aerostructures business  which exceeded the cumulative catch up income mentioned above by million  a charge of million related to the termination of a contract in the year ended december   and increased research and development costs primarily for the development of the boeing and the airbus a electronic systems electronic systems segment sales of  million in the year ended december  increased million  or percent  from  million in the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to higher sales volume of defense and space oe primarily in our optical and space systems  fuel and utility systems  sensor systems and power systems business units  partially offset by a decline in sales volume in our propulsion systems business unit  higher sales volume of regional and general aviation airplane oe and aftermarket products in our power systems and de icing and specialty systems businesses  higher sales volume of large commercial oe and aftermarket products in all of our business units  and higher sales volume of sensors for commercial helicopters  non military perimeter security and industrial gas products 
electronic systems segment operating income increased million  or percent  from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  segment operating income was higher due to higher sales volume as described above  and the absence of a million charge for the partial settlement with northrop grumman on claims related to the aeronautical systems acquisition  which was recorded in the increase in segment operating income was partially offset by unfavorable sales mix shift from higher margin aftermarket sales towards proportionately more oe sales in military and commercial markets  increased investments in research and development costs for new programs that have been won  increases in operating costs  primarily warranty expenses  and a charge to establish an environmental reserve for remediation activities 
future restructuring and consolidation costs for programs announced and initiated we expect to incur additional expenses of approximately million for restructuring programs announced and initiated prior to december  we expect to incur most of these restructuring charges through december  during  we announced and initiated a restructuring program to downsize a german facility in our electronic systems segment with partial transfers of operations to an existing facility in florida and to a new facility in india 
the aim of this project is to reduce operating costs and foreign exchange exposure 
the total restructuring cost is expected to be approximately million  of which approximately million relates to costs to be incurred in and year ended december  compared with the year ended december  year ended december  of sales change dollars in millions net customer sales airframe systems engine systems electronic systems total sales segment operating income airframe systems engine systems electronic systems segment operating income airframe systems airframe systems segment sales of  million in the year ended december  increased million  or percent  from  million in the year ended december  the increase was due to favorable currency translation on non us dollar sales and the impact of foreign currency hedge gains  primarily in the actuation systems and landing gear businesses  and higher sales volume of commercial aircraft wheels and brakes  landing gear and engineered polymer products 
partially offsetting the higher sales were decreased sales volumes in military aircraft wheels and brakes 
airframe systems segment operating income increased million  or percent  from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  the increase in operating income was primarily due to the following lower asset impairment  facility closure and headcount reduction charges 
asset impairment  including landing gear assets  facility closure and headcount reduction charges were million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december   increase in sales volume as described above  lower operating costs  and favorable income effect of million before tax from the revision of the accounting treatment of a technology development grant from a non us government entity 
partially offsetting the increase in segment operating income were the following unfavorable foreign exchange translation of non us dollar net expenses primarily in the actuation systems and landing gear businesses  higher new program research and development expenditures primarily in the actuation systems business  a charge of million for the partial settlement with northrop grumman  and unfavorable effect of downward pressure on pricing from commercial customers 
engine systems engine systems segment sales in the year ended december  of  million increased million  or percent  from  million in the year ended december  the increase was due to the following higher aerostructures mro  engine oe and aftermarket sales volume  higher cargo systems aftermarket sales volume  favorable currency translation on non us dollar sales and the impact of foreign currency hedge gains  primarily in the engine controls business  increased sales volume of us military oe and aftermarket engine controls  and higher sales volume of turbine fuel engine components for us military and regional aircraft applications and to the power generation market 
the increase was partially offset by lower us military turbomachinery repair sales 
engine systems segment operating income increased million  or percent  from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  segment operating income was higher due to the absence in of non cash write downs of inventory and long term receivables relating to the super re engining program of million and non cash asset impairment charges related to a facility held for sale of million  which were recorded in  the absence in of a million charge associated with early termination of oe deliveries of pratt whitney pw engine nacelle components  which was recorded in  higher sales volume as described above  and favorable mix of sales for aftermarket applications 
the increase in engine systems segment operating income was partially offset by the following a charge of million for the partial settlement with northrop grumman  increased aerostructures contract costs for certain commercial  military and regional jet applications  a charge in of million related to the early conclusion of boeing production  increased new program development costs for the aerostructures and engine controls businesses  and unfavorable currency translation of non us dollar costs  primarily in the aerostructures business 
electronic systems electronic systems segment sales of  million in the year ended december  increased million  or percent  from  million in the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to increased sales volume for all businesses for the regional and business oe and aftermarket markets  and increased sales volume in military and space oe in our optical and space systems  power systems and sensor systems businesses 
the increase in electronic systems segment sales was partially offset by the following lower military aftermarket sales volume in our sensor systems and fuel and utility systems businesses  and lower commercial oe sales volume in our aircraft interior products  lighting systems and power businesses and lower commercial aftermarket sales volume in our fuel and utility systems and power systems businesses 
electronic systems segment operating income decreased million  or percent  from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  segment operating income was unfavorably affected by the decline in sales volume of commercial oe and aftermarket discussed above  a charge of million for the partial settlement with northrop grumman  unfavorable costs resulting from operating inefficiencies in our propulsion products and optical and space businesses  less favorable product mix in our fuel and utility systems business  unfavorable currency translation of non us dollar costs in our lighting systems and power systems businesses  and increased research and development costs and bid and proposal costs on potential new programs 
the decrease in operating income was partially offset by lower restructuring costs 
restructuring costs for the year ended december  were million  compared to million for the year ended december  foreign operations we are engaged in business in foreign markets 
our foreign manufacturing and service facilities are located in australia  canada  china  england  france  germany  india  indonesia  ireland  japan  mexico  poland  scotland  spain and singapore 
we market our products and services through sales subsidiaries and distributors in a number of foreign countries 
we also have joint venture agreements with various foreign companies 
currency fluctuations  tariffs and similar import limitations  price controls and labor regulations can affect our foreign operations  including foreign affiliates 
other potential limitations on our foreign operations include expropriation  nationalization  restrictions on foreign investments or their transfers and additional political and economic risks 
in addition  the transfer of funds from foreign operations could be impaired by the unavailability of dollar exchange or other restrictive regulations that foreign governments could enact 
sales to non us customers were  million or percent of total sales   million or percent of total sales and  million or percent of total sales for the years ended december   and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources we currently expect to fund expenditures for capital requirements  including the implementation of a common enterprise resource planning erp system  as well as liquidity needs from a combination of cash  internally generated funds and financing arrangements 
we believe that our internal liquidity  together with access to external capital resources  will be sufficient to satisfy existing commitments and plans and also provide adequate financial flexibility 
cash at december   we had cash and marketable securities of million  as compared to million at december  credit facilities in may  we replaced our million committed global syndicated revolving credit facility expiring in august with a new million committed global syndicated revolving credit facility that expires in may the new facility has similar terms and is with substantially the same group of global banks as the previous facility 
this facility permits borrowing  including letters of credit  up to a maximum of million 
at december   there were million in borrowings classified as long term debt and million in letters of credit outstanding under this facility 
at december   there were no borrowings and million in letters of credit outstanding under the previous facility 
the level of unused borrowing capacity under our committed syndicated revolving credit facility varies from time to time depending in part upon our compliance with financial and other covenants set forth in the related agreement  including the consolidated net worth requirement and maximum leverage ratio 
we are currently in compliance with all such covenants 
as of december   we had borrowing capacity under this facility of million  after reductions for borrowings and letters of credit outstanding 
at december   we maintained million of uncommitted domestic money market facilities and million of uncommitted and committed foreign working capital facilities with various banks to meet short term borrowing requirements 
as of december  there was million outstanding under these facilities 
at december   there were no borrowings under these facilities 
these credit facilities are provided by a small number of commercial banks that also provide us with committed credit through the syndicated revolving credit facility and with various cash management  trust and other services 
our credit facilities do not contain any credit rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity of our indebtedness 
however  a ratings downgrade would result in an increase in the interest rate and fees payable under our committed syndicated revolving credit facility 
such a downgrade also could adversely affect our ability to renew existing or obtain access to new credit facilities in the future and could increase the cost of such new facilities 
quips on march   we completed the redemption of all of the million in outstanding cumulative quarterly income preferred securities  series a quips issued by bfgoodrich capital  a delaware business trust  all of the common equity of which was owned by us 
the quips were supported by our junior subordinated debentures  series a quips debentures  which were also redeemed on march  long term financing at december   we had long term debt and capital lease obligations  including current maturities  of  million with maturities ranging from to long term debt includes million borrowed under the committed revolving credit facility to facilitate our implementation of the cash repatriation provisions of the american jobs creation act 
the earliest maturity of a material long term debt obligation is april we also maintain a shelf registration statement that allows us to issue up to billion of debt securities  series preferred stock  common stock  stock purchase contracts and stock purchase units 
on april   we redeemed million in aggregate principal amount of our percent notes due in we recorded million of debt premiums and associated costs in other income expense net 
on march   we entered into a million reverse treasury lock to offset changes in the redemption price of the percent notes due to movements in treasury rates prior to the redemption date 
the reverse treasury lock matured on april  and we received million in cash  which was recorded as a gain in other income expense net 
on april   we terminated million of a million fixed to floating interest rate swap on our percent notes due in we paid million in cash to terminate this portion of the interest rate swap and the amount was recorded as an expense in other income expense net 
this portion of the interest rate swap was terminated so that the then outstanding notional amount of the fixed to floating interest rate swap would match the outstanding principal amount  subsequent to the redemption of the percent notes due in on august   we redeemed all remaining outstanding percent notes due in in the aggregate principal amount of million 
we recorded million of debt premiums and associated costs in other income expense net 
on august   we terminated the remaining million fixed to floating interest rate swap on the percent notes due in that were redeemed 
we paid million in cash to terminate the interest rate swap and the amount was recorded as an expense in other income expense net 
off balance sheet arrangements we utilize several forms of off balance sheet financing arrangements 
at december   these arrangements included undiscounted minimum future lease receivables payments sold dollars in millions tax advantaged operating leases standard operating leases short term receivables securitization program lease agreements we finance some of our office and manufacturing facilities and machinery and equipment  including corporate aircraft  under committed lease arrangements provided by financial institutions 
some of these arrangements allow us to claim a deduction for the tax depreciation on the assets  rather than the lessor  and allow us to lease aircraft having a maximum unamortized value of million at december  at december   million of future minimum lease payments were outstanding under these arrangements 
the other arrangements are standard operating leases 
future minimum lease payments under the standard operating leases approximated million at december  additionally  at december   we had guarantees of residual values of lease obligations of million 
the residual values relate to corporate aircraft which we are obligated to either purchase at the end of the lease term or remarket 
under some of these operating lease agreements we receive rent holidays  which represent periods of free or reduced rent 
rent holidays are recorded as a liability and recognized on a straight line basis over the lease term 
in addition  we may receive incentives or allowances from the lessor as part of the lease agreement 
we recognize these payments as a liability and amortize them as reductions to lease expense over the lease term 
we capitalize leasehold improvements and amortize them over the shorter of the lease term or the asset s useful life 
in december  we terminated a production equipment lease that was maturing in january and purchased the leased assets for million 
sale of receivables at december   we had in place a variable rate trade receivables securitization program pursuant to which we could sell receivables up to a maximum of million 
accounts receivable sold under this program were million at december  continued availability of the securitization program is conditioned upon compliance with covenants  related primarily to operation of the securitization  set forth in the related agreements 
we are currently in compliance with all such covenants 
the securitization does not contain any credit rating downgrade triggers pursuant to which the program could be terminated 
cash flow hedges we have subsidiaries that conduct a substantial portion of their business in euros  great britain pounds sterling  canadian dollars and polish zlotys  but have significant sales contracts that are denominated in us dollars 
approximately percent of our revenues and approximately percent of our costs are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
over percent of these net costs are in euros  great britain pounds sterling and canadian dollars 
periodically  we enter into forward contracts to exchange us dollars for euros  great britain pounds sterling  canadian dollars and polish zlotys to hedge a portion of our exposure from us dollar sales 
the forward contracts described above are used to mitigate the potential volatility of earnings and cash flow arising from changes in currency exchange rates that impact our us dollar sales for certain foreign operations 
the forward contracts are being accounted for as cash flow hedges 
the forward contracts are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at fair value with the net change in fair value reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of deferred taxes 
the notional value of the forward contracts at december  was  million 
the fair value of the forward contracts at december   was a net asset of million  including million recorded as a current asset in prepaid expenses and million recorded as a non current asset in other assets  partially offset by  million recorded as a current liability in accrued expenses and million recorded as a non current liability in other non current liabilities 
the fair value of our forward contracts of million before deferred taxes of million at december   including million of gains on previously matured hedges of intercompany sales  is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and will be reflected in income as the individual contracts mature which will offset the earnings effect of the hedged items 
as of december   the portion of the million fair value that would be reclassified into earnings as an increase in sales to offset the effect of the hedged item in the next months is a net gain of million 
in march  we called for the redemption of million in aggregate principal amount of our percent notes due in and entered into a million reverse treasury lock to offset changes in the redemption price to movements in treasury rates prior to the redemption date 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  at march   the reverse treasury lock was accounted for as a cash flow hedge and was recorded in our consolidated balance sheet at fair value with the offset reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of deferred taxes 
the reverse treasury lock matured on april  and we recorded a million gain in other income expense net 
fair value hedges in july  we entered into a million fixed to floating interest rate swap on the percent notes due in in april  we terminated million of this interest rate swap so that the outstanding notional amount of the swap would match the then outstanding principal amount of the percent notes due in we paid million in cash to terminate this portion of the swap and recorded the amount as an expense in other income expense net 
in august  we terminated the remaining million of the interest rate swap in connection with the redemption of all remaining outstanding percent notes due in we paid million in cash to terminate the swap and recorded the amount as an expense in other income expense net 
in october  we entered into two million fixed to floating interest rate swaps 
one million swap is on our percent notes due in and the other million swap is on our percent notes due in in december  we entered into another million fixed to floating interest rate swap on our percent notes due in the purpose of entering into these swaps was to increase our exposure to variable interest rates 
the settlement and maturity dates on each swap are the same as those on the referenced notes 
in accordance with sfas  the interest rate swaps are being accounted for as fair value hedges and the carrying value of the notes has been adjusted to reflect the fair values of the interest rate swaps 
the fair value of the interest rate swaps was a liability loss of million at december  other forward contracts as a supplement to our foreign exchange cash flow hedging program  in january we began to enter into forward contracts to manage our foreign currency risk related to the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the relevant functional currency 
these forward contracts mature monthly and the notional amounts are adjusted periodically to reflect changes in net monetary asset balances 
the gains or losses on these forward contracts are being recorded in cost of sales in order to mitigate the earnings impact of the translation of net monetary assets 
under this program  as of december   we had forward contracts with a notional value of million to buy great britain pounds sterling  forward contracts with a notional value of million to buy euros and forward contracts with a notional value of million to sell canadian dollars 
contractual obligations and other commercial commitments the following charts reflect our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  commercial commitments include lines of credit  guarantees and other potential cash outflows resulting from a contingent event that requires performance by us pursuant to a funding commitment

contingencies general there are pending or threatened against us or our subsidiaries various claims  lawsuits and administrative proceedings  arising in the ordinary course of business with respect to commercial  product liability  asbestos and environmental matters  which seek remedies or damages 
we believe that any liability that may finally be determined with respect to commercial and non asbestos product liability claims should not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
from time to time  we are also involved in legal proceedings as a plaintiff involving tax  contract  patent protection  environmental and other matters 
gain contingencies  if any  are recognized when they are realized 
legal costs are generally expensed when incurred 
environmental we are subject to various domestic and international environmental laws and regulations which may require that we investigate and remediate the effects of the release or disposal of materials at sites associated with past and present operations  including sites at which we have been identified as a potentially responsible party under the federal superfund laws and comparable state laws 
we are currently involved in the investigation and remediation of a number of sites under these laws 
estimates of our environmental liabilities are based on currently available facts  present laws and regulations and current technology 
these estimates take into consideration our prior experience in site investigation and remediation  the data concerning cleanup costs available from other companies and regulatory authorities and the professional judgment of our environmental specialists in consultation with outside environmental specialists  when necessary 
estimates of our environmental liabilities are further subject to uncertainties regarding the nature and extent of site contamination  the range of remediation alternatives available  evolving remediation standards  imprecise engineering evaluations and estimates of appropriate cleanup technology  methodology and cost  the extent of corrective actions that may be required and the number and financial condition of other potentially responsible parties  as well as the extent of their responsibility for the remediation 
accordingly  as investigation and remediation of these sites proceed  it is likely that adjustments in our accruals will be necessary to reflect new information 
the amounts of any such adjustments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in a given period  but the amounts  and the possible range of loss in excess of the amounts accrued  are not reasonably estimable 
based on currently available information  however  we do not believe that future environmental costs in excess of those accrued with respect to sites for which we have been identified as a potentially responsible party are likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
there can be no assurance  however  that additional future developments  administrative actions or liabilities relating to environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in a given period 
environmental liabilities are recorded when the liability is probable and the costs are reasonably estimable  which generally is not later than at completion of a feasibility study or when we have recommended a remedy or have committed to an appropriate plan of action 
the liabilities are reviewed periodically and  as investigation and remediation proceed  adjustments are made as necessary 
liabilities for losses from environmental remediation obligations do not consider the effects of inflation and anticipated expenditures are not discounted to their present value 
the liabilities are not reduced by possible recoveries from insurance carriers or other third parties  but do reflect anticipated allocations among potentially responsible parties at federal superfund sites or similar state managed sites and an assessment of the likelihood that such parties will fulfill their obligations at such sites 
our consolidated balance sheet included an accrued liability for environmental remediation obligations of million and million at december  and december   respectively 
at december  and december   million and million  respectively  of the accrued liability for environmental remediation was included in current liabilities as accrued expenses 
at december  and december   million and million  respectively  was associated with ongoing operations and million and million  respectively  was associated with businesses previously disposed of or discontinued 
the timing of expenditures depends on a number of factors that vary by site  including the nature and extent of contamination  the number of potentially responsible parties  the timing of regulatory approvals  the complexity of the investigation and remediation  and the standards for remediation 
we expect that we will expend present accruals over many years  and will complete remediation in less than years at all sites for which we have been identified as a potentially responsible party 
this period includes operation and monitoring costs that are generally incurred over to years 
asbestos we and a number of our subsidiaries have been named as defendants in various actions by plaintiffs alleging injury or death as a result of exposure to asbestos fibers in products  or which may have been present in our facilities 
a number of these cases involve maritime claims  which have been and are expected to continue to be administratively dismissed by the court 
these actions primarily relate to previously owned businesses 
we believe that pending and reasonably anticipated future actions  net of anticipated insurance recoveries  are not likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
there can be no assurance  however  that future legislative or other developments will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in a given period 
we believe that we have substantial insurance coverage available to us related to any remaining claims 
however  the primary layer of insurance coverage for most of these claims is provided by the kemper insurance companies 
kemper has indicated that  due to capital constraints and downgrades from various rating agencies  it has ceased underwriting new business and now focuses on administering policy commitments from prior years 
kemper has also indicated that it is currently operating under a run off plan approved by the illinois department of insurance 
we cannot predict the impact of kemper s financial position on the availability of the kemper insurance 
in addition  a portion of our primary and excess layers of general liability insurance coverage for most of these claims was provided by insurance subsidiaries of london united investments plc kwelm 
kwelm is insolvent and in the process of distributing its assets and dissolving 
in september  we entered into a settlement agreement with kwelm pursuant to which we agreed to give up our rights with respect to the kwelm insurance policies in exchange for million  subject to increase under certain circumstances 
the settlement represents a negotiated payment for our loss of insurance coverage  as we no longer have the kwelm insurance available for claims that would have qualified for coverage 
the initial settlement amount of million was paid to us during  was recorded as a deferred settlement credit and will be used to offset asbestos and other toxic tort claims in future periods 
the kwelm insolvent fund managers made additional settlement distributions to us in totaling million following completion of the insolvent scheme of arrangement process in the united kingdom 
the additional distribution was recorded as a deferred settlement credit and will be used to offset asbestos and other toxic tort claims in future periods 
one final distribution may be made depending on the final valuation of kwelm 
liabilities of divested businesses asbestos in may  we completed the tax free spin off of our engineered products eip segment  which at the time of the spin off included enpro industries  inc enpro and coltec industries inc coltec 
at that time  two subsidiaries of coltec were defendants in a significant number of personal injury claims relating to alleged asbestos containing products sold by those subsidiaries 
it is possible that asbestos related claims might be asserted against us on the theory that we have some responsibility for the asbestos related liabilities of enpro  coltec or its subsidiaries  even though the activities that led to those claims occurred prior to our ownership of any of those subsidiaries 
also  it is possible that a claim might be asserted against us that coltec s dividend of its aerospace business to us prior to the spin off was made at a time when coltec was insolvent or caused coltec to become insolvent 
such a claim could seek recovery from us on behalf of coltec of the fair market value of the dividend 
a limited number of asbestos related claims have been asserted against us as successor to coltec or one of its subsidiaries 
we believe that we have substantial legal defenses against these claims  as well as against any other claims that may be asserted against us on the theories described above 
in addition  the agreement between enpro and us that was used to effectuate the spin off provides us with an indemnification from enpro covering  among other things  these liabilities 
the success of any such asbestos related claims would likely require  as a practical matter  that coltec s subsidiaries were unable to satisfy their asbestos related liabilities and that coltec was found to be responsible for these liabilities and was unable to meet its financial obligations 
we believe any such claims would be without merit and that coltec was solvent both before and after the dividend of its aerospace business to us 
if we are ultimately found to be responsible for the asbestos related liabilities of coltec s subsidiaries  we believe such finding would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  but could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations and cash flows in a particular period 
however  because of the uncertainty as to the number  timing and payments related to future asbestos related claims  there can be no assurance that any such claims will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
if a claim related to the dividend of coltec s aerospace business were successful  it could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
other in connection with the divestiture of our tire  vinyl and other businesses  we have received contractual rights of indemnification from third parties for environmental and other claims arising out of the divested businesses 
failure of these third parties to honor their indemnification obligations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
guarantees at december   we had an outstanding contingent liability for guarantees of debt and lease payments of million  letters of credit and bank guarantees of million and residual value of lease obligations of million 
we guaranteed amounts previously owed by coltec capital trust with respect to million of tides  which included million of tides that were beneficially owned by coltec  and guaranteed coltec s performance of its obligations with respect to the tides and the underlying coltec convertible subordinated debentures 
following the spin off of the eip segment  the tides remained outstanding as an obligation of coltec capital trust and our guarantee with respect to the tides remained an obligation of ours 
enpro  coltec and coltec capital trust have agreed to indemnify us for any costs and liabilities arising under or related to the tides after the spin off 
on november   coltec redeemed all of the outstanding tides and underlying convertible subordinated debentures 
our guarantee of the tides terminated upon full payment of the redemption price of all of the tides  subject to reinstatement if at any time any tides holder must repay any sums paid to it with respect to the tides or our guarantee 
commercial airline customers several of our commercial airline customers are experiencing financial difficulties 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations on the financial condition of all of our customers and maintain reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable based upon expected collectibility 
although we believe our reserves are adequate  we are not able to predict the future financial stability of these customers 
any material change in the financial status of any one or group of customers could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
the extent to which extended payment terms are granted to customers may negatively affect future cash flow 
aerostructures long term contracts our aerostructures business has several long term contracts in the pre production phase 
this phase includes design of the product to meet customer specifications as well as design of the manufacturing processes to manufacture the product 
also involved in this phase is securing a supply of material and components produced by third party suppliers  which is generally accomplished through long term supply agreements 
because these contracts cover periods of up to years or more  there is risk that estimates of future costs made during the pre production phase will be different from actual costs and that the difference could be significant 
tax we are continuously undergoing examination by the irs  as well as various state and foreign jurisdictions 
the irs and other taxing authorities routinely challenge certain deductions and credits reported by us on our income tax returns 
in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes  and sfas  accounting for contingencies  we establish reserves for tax contingencies that reflect our best estimate of the deductions and credits that we may be unable to sustain  or that we could be willing to concede as part of a broader tax settlement 
differences between the reserves for tax contingencies and the amounts ultimately owed by us are recorded in the period they become known 
adjustments to our reserves could have a material effect on our financial statements 
as of december   we had recorded tax contingency reserves of approximately million 
in  coltec  our former subsidiary  made a million payment to the irs for an income tax assessment and the related accrued interest arising out of certain capital loss deductions and tax credits taken in on february   coltec filed suit against the us government in the us court of federal claims seeking a refund of this payment 
the trial portion of the case was completed in may on november   we were notified that the trial court ruled in favor of coltec and ordered the us government to refund federal tax payments of million to coltec 
this tax refund would also bear interest to the date of payment 
as of december   the interest amount was approximately million before tax  or approximately million after tax 
the us court of federal claims entered a final judgment in this case on february  during july  the us government filed its brief related to its appeal of the decision with the us court of appeals for the federal circuit 
coltec filed its brief related to the us government s appeal on september  oral arguments were heard by the us court of appeals for the federal circuit on february  a decision is expected by the us court of appeals for the federal circuit sometime in if the trial court s decision is ultimately upheld  we will be entitled to this tax refund and related interest pursuant to an agreement with coltec 
if we receive these amounts  we expect to record income of approximately million  after tax  based on interest through december   including the release of previously established reserves 
if the irs were to ultimately prevail in this case  coltec will not owe any additional interest or taxes with respect to we may  however  be required by the irs to pay up to million plus accrued interest with respect to the same items claimed by coltec in its tax returns for through the amount of the previously estimated tax liability if the irs were to prevail for the through period remains fully reserved 
in  the irs issued a statutory notice of deficiency asserting that rohr  inc rohr  our subsidiary  was liable for million of additional income taxes for the fiscal years ended july  through in  the irs issued an additional statutory notice of deficiency asserting that rohr was liable for million of additional income taxes for the fiscal years ended july  through the proposed assessments relate primarily to the timing of certain tax deductions and tax credits 
rohr has filed petitions in the us tax court opposing the proposed assessments 
at the time of settlement or final determination by the court  there will be a net cash cost to us due at least in part to the reversal of a timing item 
we believe that our total net cash cost is unlikely to exceed million 
we reserved the estimated liability associated with these cases 
we are in advanced stages of discussion with the irs to settle the rohr case and to resolve the open issues in the tax years through as described below 
our current irs examination cycle began on september  and involves the taxable years ended december  through december  the prior examination cycle which began in march has reached an advanced stage of discussion with the irs 
we anticipate substantially all of the open issues for the consolidated income tax groups in the audit periods identified below to be resolved in rohr  inc and subsidiaries july  december  through date of acquisition coltec industries inc and subsidiaries december  july  through date of acquisition goodrich corporation and subsidiaries including rohr and coltec there are numerous tax issues that have been raised during the examinations by the irs  including  but not limited to  transfer pricing  research and development credits  foreign tax credits  tax accounting for long term contracts  tax accounting for inventory  tax accounting for stock options  depreciation  amortization and the proper timing for certain other deductions for income tax purposes 
we have reached a tentative agreement with the irs on a substantial number of the issues raised in the prior examination cycle and the us tax court litigation involving rohr described above 
the final settlement of these issues is subject to a further review and approval process  the outcome of which cannot be predicted at this time 
if we settle pursuant to these discussions  we would anticipate reversing some portion of previously established reserves  which could be material to our financial statements 
we anticipate a final settlement in rohr has been under examination by the state of california for the tax years ended july   and the state of california has disallowed certain expenses incurred by one of rohr s subsidiaries in connection with the lease of certain tangible property 
california s franchise tax board held that the deductions associated with the leased equipment were non business deductions 
the additional tax associated with the franchise tax board s position is approximately million 
the amount of accrued interest associated with the additional tax is approximately million as of december  in addition  the state of california enacted an amnesty provision that imposes nondeductible penalty interest equal to percent of the unpaid interest amounts relating to taxable years ended before the penalty interest is approximately million as of december  the tax and interest amounts continue to be contested by rohr 
we believe that we are adequately reserved for this contingency 
rohr made a voluntary payment during the three months ended march  of approximately million related to items that were not being contested  consisting of approximately million related to tax and approximately million related to interest on the tax 
rohr made an additional payment during the three months ended december  of approximately million related to the contested tax amount pursuant to the state s assessment notice dated october  no payment has been made for the million of interest or million of penalty interest 
under california law  rohr may be required to pay the full amount of interest prior to filing any suit for refund 
if required  rohr expects to make this payment and file suit for a refund before the end of new accounting standards accounting changes and error corrections during may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
sfas 
under apb opinion no 
 most voluntary changes in accounting principle were recognized by including the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle in net income in the period of change 
sfas will require retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to determine the period specific effects of the cumulative effect of the change 
sfas will apply to all accounting changes made after adoption of the statement  which is required by the fiscal year beginning after december  we adopted sfas on january  to date  the adoption of sfas has not had a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
inventory costs the fasb recently issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 inventory costs sfas  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter adoption of sfas is required by the year beginning january  the amendments made by sfas clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted materials spoilage should be recognized as current period charges and requires the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
while sfas enhances arb and clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material spoilage  the statement also removes inconsistencies between arb and international accounting standards ias and amends arb to clarify that abnormal amounts of costs should be recognized as period costs 
under some circumstances  according to arb  the above listed costs may be so abnormal as to require treatment as current period charges 
sfas requires these items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal and requires allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
we adopted sfas on january  the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows

generally  the approach in sfas r is similar to the approach described in sfas we adopted the sfas fair value based method of accounting for share based payments effective january  using the modified prospective method described in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas r requires that we use the valuation technique that best fits the circumstances 
we currently use and will continue to use the black scholes formula to estimate the fair value of stock options granted to employees 
sfas r requires that the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow  which is our current practice 
as a result  the adoption of sfas r will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in the periods after the effective date 
sfas r also requires that we estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest and to revise the estimate as the actual forfeitures differ from the estimate 
our current policy is to recognize forfeitures as they occur 
in accordance with sfas r  the explicit service period for employees that are eligible to retire or become eligible to retire is considered to be nonsubstantive  which would require compensation cost to be recognized over the period through the date that the employee first becomes eligible to retire and is no longer required to provide service to earn the award 
our current policy is to recognize compensation cost over the explicit service period ie  up to the date of actual retirement as opposed to through the date the employee first becomes eligible to retire 
upon adoption of sfas r  we will be required to change our policy and to recognize compensation expense for awards granted subsequent to january  over a period ending with the date the employee first becomes eligible for retirement 
if we had previously applied the nonsubstantive vesting provisions of sfas r when it adopted sfas on january   recognized compensation cost would have increased by approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
based upon current assumptions regarding nonsubstantive vesting and grants of stock based compensation in  recognized compensation cost is expected to increase by approximately million for the year ending december  as a result of adopting sfas r 
on march   the us securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab relating to sfas r 
sab provides interpretive guidance related to the interaction between sfas r and certain sec rules and regulations and provides the sec staff s views regarding the valuation of share based payment arrangements for public companies 
sab also requires disclosures within filings made with the sec relating to the accounting for share based payment transactions  particularly during the transition to sfas r 
we will incorporate the sab guidance in conjunction with our adoption of sfas r on january  accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations during march  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations fin  which is an interpretation of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas 
the interpretation clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation refers to the legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing or method of settlement is conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
adoption of fin is required by the fiscal year ending after december  we adopted fin on december  the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
accounting for purchased or acquired leasehold improvements in june  the fasb s emerging issues task force reached a consensus on issue no 
 determining the amortization period for leasehold improvements purchased after lease inception or acquired in a business combination eitf 
this guidance requires that leasehold improvements acquired in a business combination or purchased subsequent to the inception of a lease be amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the assets or a term that includes required lease periods and renewals that are reasonably assured at the date of the business combination or purchase 
the guidance is applicable only to leasehold improvements that are purchased or acquired in reporting periods beginning after june  we do not expect the adoption of eitf to have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to customer programs and incentives  product returns  bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  financing obligations  service and product warranties  excess component order cancellation costs  restructuring  long term service contracts  pensions and other postretirement benefits  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition for revenues not recognized under the contract method of accounting  we recognize revenues from the sale of products at the point of passage of title  which typically is at the time of shipment 
revenues earned from providing maintenance service are recognized when the service is complete 
in multiple deliverable arrangements  the revenues for products and services are allocated based upon their relative fair value 
contract accounting percentage of completion effective january   we changed two aspects of the application of contract accounting for our aerostructures business unit  including a change to the cumulative catch up method from the reallocation method for accounting for changes in contract estimates of revenue and costs and a change to the accounting for certain pre certification costs 
pre certification costs  including those in excess of original estimated levels  are now included in total contract costs used to evaluate overall contract profitability 
these contract accounting methods are described below 
the impact of these changes on our financial statements was income of approximately million after tax or million before tax  which was reported as a cumulative effect of change in accounting in revenue recognition we have sales under long term contracts  many of which contain escalation clauses  requiring delivery of products over several years and frequently providing the buyer with option pricing on follow on orders 
sales and profits on each contract are recognized in accordance with the percentage of completion method of accounting  primarily using the units of delivery method 
we follow the requirements of statement of position sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts the contract method of accounting  using the cumulative catch up method in accounting for revisions in estimates 
under the cumulative catch up method  the impact of revisions in estimates related to units shipped to date is recognized immediately when changes in estimated contract profitability are known 
profit is estimated based on the difference between total estimated revenue and total estimated cost of a contract 
changes in estimated total revenue and estimated total cost are recognized as business or economic conditions change and the impact on contract profitability is recorded immediately in that period using the cumulative catch up method 
cost includes the estimated cost of the pre production effort  primarily tooling and engineering design  plus the estimated cost of manufacturing a specified number of production units 
the specified number of production units used to establish the profit margin is predicated upon contractual terms adjusted for market forecasts and does not exceed the lesser of those quantities assumed in original contract pricing as adjusted to the date of certification  or those quantities which we now expect to deliver in the timeframe period assumed in the original contract pricing or at the date of certification 
our policies only allow the estimated number of production units to be delivered to exceed the quantity assumed within the original contract pricing or at date of certification when we receive firm orders for additional units or we are required to begin manufacturing of units under contractual production lead time 
the assumed timeframe period is generally equal to the period specified in the contract 
if the contract is a life of program contract  then such period is equal to the time period used in the original pricing model adjusted  if appropriate  to the expected period of production estimated at the date of certification 
option quantities are combined with prior orders when follow on orders are released 
the contract method of accounting involves the use of various estimating techniques to project revenues and costs at completion and includes estimates of recoveries asserted against the customer for changes in specifications 
these estimates involve various assumptions and projections relative to the outcome of future events  including the quantity and timing of product deliveries 
also included are assumptions relative to future labor performance and rates  and projections relative to material and overhead costs 
these assumptions involve various levels of expected performance improvements 
we re evaluate our contract estimates periodically and reflect changes in estimates immediately under the cumulative catch up method for the impact on shipments to date 
included in contract costs  or estimated revenues  are the expected impact of specific contingencies that we believe are probable 
if actual experience differs from estimates or facts and circumstances change  estimated costs or revenues will be revised 
included in sales are amounts arising from contract terms that provide for invoicing a portion of the contract price at a date after delivery 
also included are negotiated values for units delivered and anticipated price adjustments for contract changes  claims  escalation and estimated earnings in excess of billing provisions  resulting from the percentage of completion method of accounting 
certain contract costs are estimated based on the learning curve concept discussed in the inventory section 
estimates of revenue and cost for our contracts span a period of many years from the inception of the contracts to the date of actual shipments and are based on a substantial number of underlying assumptions 
we believe that the underlying factors are sufficiently reliable to provide a reasonable estimate of the profit to be generated 
however  due to the significant length of time over which revenue streams will be generated  the variability of the assumptions of the revenue and cost streams can be significant if the factors change 
the factors include but are not limited to the following projected number of units to be delivered under the contracts  assumed escalation factor for future sales prices under the contracts  estimated costs  including material and labor costs  estimated labor improvement due to the learning curve  estimated supplier pricing  and estimated cost increases due to inflation or availability of certain materials 
inventory inventoried costs on long term contracts include certain pre production costs  consisting primarily of tooling and design costs and production costs  including applicable overhead 
the costs attributed to units delivered under long term commercial contracts are based on the estimated average cost of all units expected to be produced and are determined under the learning curve concept  which anticipates a predictable decrease in unit costs as tasks and production techniques become more efficient through repetition 
this usually results in an increase in inventory referred to as excess over average during the early years of a contract 
if in process inventory plus estimated costs to complete a specific contract exceeds the anticipated remaining sales value of such contract  such excess is charged to cost of sales in the period recognized  thus reducing inventory to estimated realizable value 
income taxes in accordance with sfas  apb opinion no 
 and fin no 
 as of each reporting period  we estimate an effective income tax rate that is expected to be applicable for the full fiscal year 
the estimate of our effective income tax rate involves significant judgments regarding the application of complex tax regulations across many jurisdictions and estimates as to the amount and jurisdictional source of income expected to be earned during the full fiscal year 
further influencing this estimate are evolving interpretations of new and existing tax laws  rulings by taxing authorities and court decisions 
due to the subjective and complex nature of these underlying issues  our actual effective tax rate and related tax liabilities may differ from our initial estimates 
differences between our estimated and actual effective income tax rates and related liabilities are recorded in the period they become known 
the resulting adjustment to our income tax expense could have a material effect on our results of operations in the period the adjustment is recorded 
in accordance with sfas  we record tax contingencies when the exposure item becomes probable and the amount is reasonably estimable 
as of december  and december   we had recorded tax contingency reserves of approximately million and million  respectively 
in accordance with sfas  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for tax carryforwards and the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and income tax purposes are measured using enacted tax laws and rates 
a valuation allowance is provided on deferred tax assets if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized 
identifiable intangible assets identifiable intangible assets are recorded at cost  or when acquired as part of a business combination  at estimated fair value 
these assets include patents and other technology agreements  sourcing contracts  trademarks  licenses  customer relationships and non compete agreements 
intangible assets are generally amortized using the straight line method over estimated useful lives of to years for all acquisitions completed on or prior to june  for acquisitions completed subsequent to june   identifiable intangible assets are amortized over their useful life using undiscounted cash flows  a method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed 
impairments of identifiable intangible assets are recognized when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset  or related groups of assets  may not be recoverable and our estimate of undiscounted cash flows over the assets remaining useful lives is less than the carrying value of the assets 
the determination of undiscounted cash flow is based on our segments plans 
the revenue growth is based upon aircraft build projections from aircraft manufacturers and widely available external publications 
the profit margin assumption is based upon the current cost structure and anticipated cost reductions 
measurement of the amount of impairment may be based upon an appraisal  market values of similar assets or estimated discounted future cash flows resulting from the use and ultimate disposition of the asset 
participation payments certain of our businesses make cash payments under long term contractual arrangements to oe manufacturers oem or system contractors in return for a secured position on the aircraft program 
participation payments are capitalized as other assets and amortized as cost of sales 
participation payments are amortized over the estimated number of production units to be shipped over the program s production life 
at december  and  the carrying amount of participation payments was million and million  respectively 
the carrying amount of participation payments is evaluated for recovery at least annually or when other indicators of impairment  such as a change in the estimated number of units or a revision in the economics of the program 
if such estimates change  amortization expense is adjusted and or an impairment charge is recorded  as appropriate  for the effect of the revised estimates 
no such impairment charges were recorded in the years ended december   or entry fees certain businesses in our engine systems segment make cash payments to an oem under long term contractual arrangements related to new engine programs 
the payments are referred to as entry fees and entitle us to a controlled access supply contract and a percentage of total program revenue generated by the oem 
entry fees are capitalized in other assets and are amortized on a straight line basis to cost of sales over the program s estimated useful life following aircraft certification  which typically approximates years 
as of december  and  the carrying amount of entry fees was million and million  respectively 
the carrying amount of entry fees is evaluated for recovery at least annually or when other significant assumptions or economic conditions change 
recovery of entry fees is assessed based on the expected cash flow from the program over the remaining program life as compared to the recorded amount of entry fees 
if carrying value of the entry fees exceeds the cash flow to be generated from the program  a charge would be recorded for the amount by which the carrying amount of the entry fee exceeds its fair value 
no such impairment charges were recorded in the years ended december   or as with any investment  there are risks inherent in recovering the value of entry fees 
such risks are consistent with the risks associated in acquiring a revenue producing asset in which market conditions may change or the risks that arise when a manufacturer of a product on which a royalty is based has business difficulties and cannot produce the product 
such risks include but are not limited to the following changes in market conditions that may affect product sales under the program  including market acceptance and competition from others  performance of subcontract suppliers and other production risks  bankruptcy or other less significant financial difficulties of other program participants  including the aircraft manufacturer  the oem and other program suppliers or the aircraft customer  and availability of specialized raw materials in the marketplace 
sales incentives we offer sales incentives to certain airline customers in connection with sales contracts 
these incentives may consist of up front cash payments  merchandise credits and or free products 
the cost of these incentives is recognized in the period incurred unless recovery of these costs is specifically guaranteed by the customer in the contract 
if the contract contains such a guarantee  then the cost of the sales incentive is capitalized as other assets and amortized to cost of sales using the straight line method over the remaining contract term 
at december  and  the carrying amount of sales incentives was million and million  respectively 
the carrying amount of sales incentives is evaluated for recovery when indicators of potential impairment exist 
the carrying value of the sales incentives is also compared annually to the amount recoverable under the terms of the guarantee in the customer contract 
if the amount of the carrying value of the sales incentives exceeds the amount recoverable in the contract  the carrying value is reduced 
no such charges were recorded in the years ended december   or flight certification costs when a supply arrangement is secured  certain of our businesses may agree to supply hardware to an oem to be used in flight certification testing and or make cash payments to reimburse an oem for costs incurred in testing the hardware 
the flight certification testing is necessary to certify aircraft systems components for the aircraft s airworthiness and allows the aircraft to be flown and thus sold in the country certifying the aircraft 
flight certification costs are capitalized in other assets and are amortized to cost of sales over the projected number of aircraft to be manufactured 
as of december  and  the carrying amount of flight certification costs was million 
the carrying amount of flight certification costs is evaluated for recovery when indicators of impairment exist 
the carrying value of the asset and amortization expense is adjusted when the estimated number of units to be manufactured changes 
a charge of million was recorded in the year ended december  for a reduction in the estimate of the number of units to be manufactured of a program 
no such charges were recorded in the years ended december  or service and product warranties we provide service and warranty policies on certain of our products 
we accrue liabilities under service and warranty policies based upon specific claims and a review of historical warranty and service claim experience in accordance with sfas adjustments are made to accruals as claim data and historical experience change 
in addition  we incur discretionary costs to service our products in connection with product performance issues 
our service and product warranty reserves are based upon a variety of factors 
any significant change in these factors could have a material impact on our results of operations 
such factors include but are not limited to the following the historical performance of our products and changes in performance of newer products  the mix and volumes of products being sold  and the impact of product changes 
pension and postretirement benefits other than pensions assumptions used in determining the benefit obligations and the annual expense for our pension and postretirement benefits other than pensions are evaluated and established 
we consult with an outside actuary for most of the assumptions 
assumptions such as the rate of compensation increase and the long term rate of return on plan assets are based upon our historical and benchmark data  as well as our outlook for the future 
health care cost projections and the mortality rate assumption are evaluated annually 
we have changed from a us discount rate benchmarked on the moody s aa index  which was used to determine the benefit obligations as of december  to a rate in the current year that better matches the benefit payment obligations of the plans 
for december  the us discount rates were determined at the end of the year based on a customized yield curve approach that matches the benefit payment obligation 
our pension and postretirement benefit payment streams were each plotted against a yield curve composed of a large  diverse group of aa rated corporate bonds 
the resulting discount rates were used to determine the benefit obligations as of december  in the uk  the iboxx aa long term high quality bond rate was used as the basis for determining the discount rate for both and the appropriate benchmarks by applicable country were used for other non us and non us pension plans to determine the discount rate assumptions 
following is a summary of our assumptions for determining the pension and postretirement benefits other than pension obligations and the annual cost for weighted average assumptions used to determine the benefit obligations as of december  other us plans us plans us plans discount rate pensions discount rate postretirement benefits other than pension n a n a rate of compensation increase also for measurement purposes  we changed to the rp mortality table from the gam table for the determination of the benefit obligations as of december  to determine postretirement benefits other than pension obligations  a percent annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed for the rate was assumed to decrease gradually to percent for and remain at that level thereafter

the discount rate to determine costs for postretirement benefits other than pension was percent for based on pension assumptions as of january   we expect to incur additional pension expense of approximately million before tax in  compared to sensitivity analysis the table below quantifies the approximate impact of a one quarter percentage point change in the assumed discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets for our pension plan cost and liability holding all other assumptions constant 
the discount rate assumption is selected each year based on market conditions in effect as of the disclosure date 
the rate selected is used to measure liabilities as of the disclosure date and for calculating the following year s pension expense 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption  although reviewed each year  is changed less frequently due to the long term nature of the assumption 
this assumption does not impact the measurement of assets or liabilities as of disclosure date  rather  it is used only in the calculation of pension expense

employees hired on and after january   will not participate in the goodrich employees pension plan 
these new employees will receive a higher level of company contribution in the goodrich employees savings plan 
new employees will receive a dollar for dollar match on the first percent of pay contributed  plus an automatic annual employer contribution of percent of pay 
however  this percent employer contribution is subject to a year vesting requirement 
during the first half of  persons employed by us at december  must elect whether they want to continue with the current benefits in the defined benefit and defined contribution plans or cease to earn additional service in the pension plan as of june  and receive the higher level of company contributions in the employees savings plan 
those employees choosing the latter option will continue to have pay received after june  included in their final average earnings used to calculate their pension benefit 
this change in retirement benefits is expected to result in a curtailment charge and a revision to pension expense for the remainder of the year after the curtailment date 
the charge and updated pension expense will be known when we can reasonably estimate the effect of the employee elections 
the curtailment charge will be based on the unrecognized prior service cost attributable to the employees who elect the new arrangement 
the revised pension expense will reflect the elimination of service cost and amortization of prior service cost for the employees who elect the new arrangement

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks as part of our ongoing business operations  including risks from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  which could impact our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we manage our exposure to these and other market risks through regular operating and financing activities and through the use of derivative financial instruments 
we intend to use such derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for speculative investment purposes 
refer to note derivatives and hedging activities in our consolidated financial statements for a description of current developments involving our hedging activities 
interest rate exposure we are exposed to interest rate risk as a result of our outstanding variable rate debt obligations and interest rate swaps 
the table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
in addition to those financial instruments  we had million outstanding at year end under our variable rate receivables securitization program 
at december   a hypothetical basis point unfavorable change in interest rates would increase annual interest expense by approximately million 
in october  we entered into two million fixed to floating interest rate swaps 
one million swap is on our percent senior notes due in and the other million swap is on our percent medium term notes due in in december  we entered into a million fixed to floating interest rate swap on our percent senior notes due in the purpose of the interest rates swaps was to increase our exposure to variable interest rates 
the settlement and maturity dates on the swaps are the same as those on the related notes 
in accordance with sfas  the carrying values of the notes have been adjusted to reflect the fair values of the related interest rate swaps 
the table represents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected contractual maturity dates excluding the receivables securitization program 
also included is information about our interest rate swaps 
expected maturity dates fair debt thereafter total value dollars in millions debt fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate capital lease obligations interest rate swaps fixed to variable notional value loss average pay rate average receive rate foreign currency exposure we are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations 
these risks include transactions denominated in foreign currencies  the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the relevant functional currency and translation of income and expense and balance sheet amounts of our foreign subsidiaries to the us dollar 
our objective is to minimize our exposure to transaction and income risks through our normal operating activities and  where appropriate  through foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
foreign exchange negatively impacted the financial results in our business segments in approximately percent of our revenues and approximately percent of our costs are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
over percent of these net costs are in euros  great britain pounds sterling and canadian dollars 
we do hedge a portion of our exposure of us dollar sales on an ongoing basis 
as currency exchange rates fluctuate  translation of the statements of income of international businesses into us dollars will affect comparability of revenues and expenses between years 
we have entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to sell us dollars for great britain pounds sterling  canadian dollars  euros and polish zlotys 
these forward contracts are used to mitigate a portion of the potential volatility to earnings and cash flows arising from changes in currency exchange rates 
as of december  we had forward contracts with an aggregate notional amount of million to buy great britain pounds sterling  forward contracts with an aggregate notional amount of million to buy canadian dollars  forward contracts with an aggregate notional amount of million to buy euros and forward contracts with an aggregate notional amount of million to buy polish zlotys 
these forward contracts mature on a monthly basis with maturity dates that range from january to december at december   a hypothetical percent strengthening of the us dollar against other foreign currencies would decrease the value of the forward contracts described above by million 
the fair value of these forward contracts was million at december  because we hedge only a portion of our exposure  a strengthening of the us dollar as described above would have a more than offsetting benefit to our financial results in future periods 
in addition to the foreign exchange cash flow hedges  we have entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to manage foreign currency risk related to the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the relevant functional currency 
these forward contracts mature monthly and the notional amounts are adjusted periodically to reflect changes in net monetary asset balances 
as of december   we had forward contracts with a notional value of million to buy great britain pounds sterling  forward contracts with a notional value of million to buy euros and forward contracts with a notional value of million to sell canadian dollars
