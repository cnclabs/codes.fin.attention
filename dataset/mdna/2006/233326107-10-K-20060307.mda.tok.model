the amortization of the dst identified intangibles will further reduce the equity in earnings attributed to the asurion investment 
asurion will account for lock line as a purchase and will perform an allocation of purchase price value in excess of the net assets of lock line 
this will result in intangible assets being identified that asurion will amortize in the future 
the amortization of the collective identified intangibles from dst and asurion will likely result in the transaction being dilutive to earnings per share

interest is payable initially in cash semiannually in arrears on february and august  beginning february   until august  for the series a debentures and beginning february  until august  for the series b debentures 
beginning august  for the series a debentures and august  for the series b debentures  the company will not pay regular cash interest on the debentures prior to maturity 
instead  the original principal amount of each debenture will increase daily at a rate of per year series a and per year series b to  and  respectively  which is the full accreted principal amount payable at maturity for each  original principal amount of series a debentures and series b debentures  respectively 
the company will pay contingent interest on the series a debentures and series b debentures during any six month interest period commencing with the period from august  and  respectively  to february  and  respectively  and thereafter from february to august or august to february  for which the average trading price of the debentures for the applicable five trading day reference period equals or exceeds of the accreted principal amount of the debentures 
beginning august  series a and august  series b  the company may redeem for cash all or part of the debentures at any time at a redemption price equal to the accreted principal amount of the debentures to be redeemed plus any accrued and unpaid cash interest  including contingent interest and liquidated damages  if any  to the redemption date 
debenture holders may require the company to purchase the debentures on august    and series a and august    and series b at a purchase price equal to the accreted principal amount of the debentures to be purchased plus any accrued and unpaid cash interest  including contingent interest and liquidated damages  if any  to such purchase date

for purchases of series a debentures on august  and  and for purchases of series b debentures on august  and  the company may elect to pay in cash  common stock or any combination thereof 
the debentures are convertible under specified circumstances into shares of the company s common stock at a conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of debentures which is equal to an initial conversion price of  subject to adjustment 
the conversion rights for these debentures include during any calendar quarter if the last reported sale price of dst s common stock for at least trading days during the period of consecutive trading days ending on the last day of the previous calendar quarter  is greater than or equal to of the applicable conversion price  subject to certain exceptions  during the five day business period after any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per  original principal amount for each day of that period was less than of the product of the last reported sales price of dst s common stock and the conversion rate on each such day  if the debentures have been called for redemption  and upon the occurrence of a specified corporate transaction as described in the agreement 
upon conversion  the company will have the right to deliver  in lieu of shares of its common stock  cash or a combination of cash and shares of common stock

new accounting standards in december  the fasb issued its final standard on accounting for share based payments  sfas no 
r sfas no 
r revised 
sfas no 
r requires that the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements 
the cost will be measured based on the fair value of the instruments issued 
sfas no 
r covers a wide range of share based compensation arrangements including share options  restricted share plans  performance based awards  share appreciation rights and employee share purchase plans 
sfas no 
r replaces sfas no 
and supersedes apb opinion no 
as originally issued in  sfas no 
established as preferable the fair value based method of accounting for share based payment transactions with employees 
however  that statement permitted entities the option of continuing to apply the guidance in opinion  as long as the notes to the financial statements disclosed what net income would have been had the fair value method been applied 
the company will apply sfas no 
r effective january  and expects to use the modified prospective method to adopt the standard 
the company is still evaluating the impact of adopting this accounting standard 
in november  the eitf issued eitf topic  accounting issues related to certain features of contingently convertible debt and the effect on diluted earnings per share 
under eitf  a company is required to include the effects of contingently convertible bonds in diluted earnings per share from the date of issuance  without considering the impact of the conversion price 
under eitf  the company can still utilize the net share settlement method of calculating shares for the conversion premium if it intends to settle the principal amount of the bonds in cash and any excess value with shares of its common stock 
related to the company s convertible debenture issuance as described earlier  the impact of eitf to the company is that the calculation of diluted earnings per share would include an incremental amount of shares assumed to be issued for the conversion spread if the company s stock price at the end of a quarter exceeds per share 
the company adopted eitf in the fourth quarter of  and because the company s average daily stock price for that quarter did not exceed  there was no impact during that quarter on the calculation of diluted earnings per share from the adoption of eitf there was no impact on the company s calculated diluted earnings per share for any historical periods due to the adoption of eitf during the year ended december   the number of diluted shares outstanding increased by approximately million shares as a result of the company s average daily share price being greater than per share during the quarters ended september  and december  on september   the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued an exposure draft on a proposed accounting standard that would amend sfas  earnings per share  to clarify guidance for mandatorily convertible instruments  the treasury stock method  contingently issuable shares  and contracts that may be settled in cash or shares 
the proposed amendment  which is designed for convergence with international accounting standards  would require the use of the if converted method from the date of issuance of the convertible debentures 
the proposed amendment would remove the ability of a company to support the presumption that the convertible securities will be satisfied in cash and not converted into shares of common stock 
accordingly  the company s stated intention to settle the conversions with cash for the principal and accrued and unpaid interest and issue common stock for any conversion value amount over the principal and accrued and unpaid interest amounts would no longer be accepted under sfas  if amended as proposed 
the final statement is expected to be issued in the first quarter of the statement would be effective for interim and annual periods ending after june  retrospective application would be required for all changes to sfas  except that retrospective application would be prohibited for contracts that were either settled in cash prior to adoption or modified prior to adoption to require cash settlement 
for dst  adoption of this statement  as proposed  will require retroactive restatement of the company s diluted earnings per share calculations subsequent to the issuance of the convertible debentures 
in calculating diluted earnings per share under the revised sfas if converted method included in the exposure draft  the company would need to increase net income for the interest expense associated with the convertible debentures  net of tax  and increase the incremental shares assumed to be issued upon conversion by million shares  the amount of shares that would be issued if all million of convertible debentures would be converted to equity 
under this method  diluted earnings per share would have been   and for the years ended december   and  respectively  as compared to the reported amounts of  and 
the above pro forma information presents only the effect on diluted earnings per share of the if converted method included in the exposure draft  but does not include any other computational changes ie  treasury stock method considerations discussed in the exposure draft 
dst is still evaluating the remaining aspects of this proposed accounting standard 
the proposed change in accounting principle would affect the calculation of diluted earnings per share during the period the debentures are outstanding  but would not affect dst s ability to ultimately settle the convertible debentures in cash  shares or any combination thereof 
the estimated impact of this new accounting standard reflects the company s current views 
there may be material differences between these estimates and the actual impact of the standard when issued as final 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition  results of operations and cash flows are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements revenue recognition  software capitalization and amortization  depreciation of fixed assets  valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill  and accounting for investments 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition the company derives over of its revenues as a result of providing processing and services under contracts 
the majority of the amount is billed on a monthly basis generally with thirty day collection terms 
revenues are recognized for monthly processing and services upon performance of the services 
in the event a portion of the company s revenues are due months or more from the invoice date  the company accounts for the revenue as not being fixed and determinable 
in these cases  the revenue is recognized as it becomes due 
the company enters into revenue arrangements to sell products hardware and software and services in which the company is obligated to deliver to its customers multiple products and or services multiple deliverables 
revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are evaluated to determine if the deliverables items can be divided into more than one unit of accounting 
an item can generally be considered a separate unit of accounting if all of the following criteria are met the delivered item s has value to the customer on a standalone basis  there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item s  and if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item s  delivery or performance of the undelivered item s is considered probable and substantially in the control of the company 
items which do not meet these criteria are combined into a single unit of accounting 
if there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value for all units of accounting  the arrangement consideration is allocated to the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values 
in cases where there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item s in an arrangement but no such evidence for the delivered item s  the residual method is used to allocate the arrangement consideration 
for units of accounting which include more than one deliverable  the company generally defers all revenue for the unit of accounting until the period over which the last undelivered item is delivered 
the company recognizes revenue when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
if there is a customer acceptance provision in a contract or if there is uncertainty about customer acceptance  the associated revenue is deferred until the company has evidence of customer acceptance 
the company s standard business practice is to bill monthly for development  consulting and training services on a time and material basis 
there are exceptions  whereby certain commercial arrangements require a fixed fee for development and consulting services 
for fixed fee arrangements  the company recognizes revenue on a percentage of completion basis 
the company derives less than of its revenues from licensing products 
the company licenses its asset management products and its awd product generally to non mutual fund customers and international customers and its affinity customer billing software solution products to international customers 
software license revenues are recognized at the time the contract is signed  the software is delivered and no future software obligations exist 
deferral of software license revenue billed results from delayed payment provisions  disproportionate discounts between the license and other services or the inability to unbundle certain services 
the company recognizes revenues for maintenance services ratably over the contract term  after collectibility has been assured 
the company has entered into various agreements with related parties  principally unconsolidated affiliates  to utilize the company s data processing facilities and computer software systems 
the company believes that the terms of its contracts with related parties are fair to the company and are no less favorable to the company than those obtained from unaffiliated parties 
for all revenues  the company assesses collection based on a variety of factors  including past collection history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
the company does not request collateral from its customers 
if it is determined that collection of revenues is not reasonably assured  revenue is deferred and is recognized at the time it becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
allowances for billing adjustments are determined as revenues are recognized and are recorded as reductions in revenues 
doubtful account expense for the company is immaterial 
software capitalization and amortization the company makes substantial investments in software to enhance the functionality and facilitate the delivery of its processing and services as well as its sale of licensed products 
purchased software is recorded at cost and is amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated economic lives of three to five years 
the company also develops a large portion of its software internally 
the company is required to capitalize software development costs under two separate accounting pronouncements 
the first  sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed  applies to software that will be sold or delivered to third parties and requires capitalization of research and development costs after technological feasibility has been established and management is committed to funding the project 
the second pronouncement  statement of position sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use  requires capitalization of certain development costs after the design has been approved and management is committed to funding the project 
the capitalized software development costs are generally amortized on a straight line basis  based on an estimated economic life  which is dependent on the nature of the project 
the company has assigned lives of three to five years for capitalized software development 
significant management judgment is required in determining what projects and costs associated with software development will be capitalized and in assigning estimated economic lives to the completed projects 
management specifically analyzes software development projects and analyzes the percentage of completion as compared to the initial plan and subsequent forecasts  milestones achieved and the commitment to continue funding the projects 
significant changes in any of these items may result in discontinuing capitalization of development costs  as well as immediately expensing previously capitalized costs 
the company reviews  on a quarterly basis  its capitalized software for possible impairment 
depreciation of fixed assets the company s philosophy on personal property  specifically data processing equipment  is to own the property as opposed to leasing it where practicable 
the company believes this approach provides it better flexibility for disposing or redeploying the asset as it nears the completion of its economic life 
the company depreciates data processing equipment using accelerated depreciation methods over the following lives non mainframe equipment three years  mainframe central processing unit four years  and mainframe direct access storage devices and tape devices five years 
the company depreciates furniture and fixtures over estimated useful lives  principally three to five years  on a straight line basis 
the company depreciates large printing and inserting equipment used by the output solutions segment over a five to seven year life 
the company depreciates leasehold improvements using the straight line method over the lesser of the term of the lease or life of the improvements

valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill the company assesses the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill and enterprise level goodwill at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors that are considered important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of the company s use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when it is determined that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill and enterprise level goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  the company measures any impairment based on gross cash flows 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  the company and its unconsolidated affiliates do not amortize goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives 
instead  these assets are tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
no impairments have been identified as a result of these annual tests

future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future  which could have a material effect on the company s financial position 
the equity method of accounting is used for investments in corporations in which the company or its subsidiaries have at least a voting interest and significant influence but does not control and for all investments in partnerships and similar interests which the company does not control 
the company classifies these investments as unconsolidated affiliates 
under the equity method  the company recognizes  on an equity basis  income or losses from its pro rata share of these unconsolidated affiliates net income or loss  which changes the carrying value of the investment of the unconsolidated affiliate 
in certain cases  pro rata losses are recognized only to the extent of the company s investment and advances to the unconsolidated affiliate 
the company s carrying value of unconsolidated affiliates approximates its pro rata share of the unconsolidated affiliate net tangible assets 
in  the company recognized a million impairment charge related to a owned unconsolidated affiliate 
although the company does not expect that it will need to record any additional impairment charges for its investments in unconsolidated affiliates  future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of unconsolidated affiliates could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the unconsolidated affiliate investment that may not be reflected in the investment s carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future
