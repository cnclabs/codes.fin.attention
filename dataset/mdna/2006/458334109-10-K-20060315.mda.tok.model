item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview we operate in the fragrance and cosmetic industry  and manufacture  market and distribute a wide array of fragrances  cosmetics and health and beauty aids 
we manage our business in two segments  french based operations and united states based operations 
we specialize in prestige  specialty retail  and mass market perfumes  cosmetics and other personal care products 
practically all of our prestige products are produced and marketed by our owned subsidiary in paris  inter parfums  sa  which is also a publicly traded company as of inter parfums  sa shares trade on the euronext

our specialty retail products consist of products under development for gap and banana republic 
these new products are expected to launch at banana republic in the fall of and at gap in we grow our business in two distinct ways 
first  we grow by adding new brands to our portfolio  either through new licenses or out right acquisitions of brands 
second  we grow through the creation of product line extensions within the existing brands in our portfolio 
every two to three years  we create a new family of fragrances for each brand in our portfolio 
our business is not very capital intensive  and it is important to note that we do not own any manufacturing facilities 
rather  we act as a general contractor and source our needed components from our suppliers 
these components are received at one of our distribution centers and then  based upon production needs  the components are sent to one of several outside fillers which manufacture the finished good for us and ship it back to our distribution center

the initial term of this agreement expires on august   and the agreement includes an additional two year optional term that expires on august   as well as a further additional two year term that expires on august   in each case if certain retail sales targets are met or gap chooses to extend the term

the agreement has a year term with an option to extend the license by an additional five years subject to mutual agreement 
in addition  burberry has the right on december  and december  to buy back the license at its then fair market value 
this new agreement replaces the existing license 
the new royalty rates  which are approximately double the rates under the prior license  commenced as of july  the new advertising and promotional expenditures  which commenced on january   are substantially higher than under the prior license 
in anticipation of these new terms and to mitigate the associated expenses  we are fine tuning our operating model 
the new model includes increased selling prices to distributors  modified cost sharing arrangements with suppliers and distributors  and the future formation of joint ventures or company owned subsidiaries within key markets to handle future distribution 
while we have experienced a negative impact on our bottom line in  the growth potential offered by this international luxury brand makes us confident about our future long term prospects 
discussion of critical accounting policies we make estimates and assumptions in the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
these accounting policies generally require our management s most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the following is a brief discussion of the more critical accounting policies that we employ 
revenue recognition we sell our products to department stores  perfumeries  mass market retailers  supermarkets and domestic and international wholesalers and distributors 
sales of such products by our domestic subsidiaries are denominated in us dollars and sales of such products by our foreign subsidiaries are primarily denominated in either euros or us dollars 
accounts receivable reflect the granting of credit to these customers 
we generally grant credit based upon our analysis of the customer s financial position as well as previously established buying patterns 
generally  we do not bill customers for shipping and handling costs and all shipping and handling costs  which aggregated million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  are included in selling and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of income 
we recognize revenues when merchandise is shipped and the risk of loss passes to the customer 
net sales are comprised of gross revenues less returns  and trade discounts and allowances 
sales returns generally  we do not permit customers to return their unsold products 
however  on a case by case basis we occasionally allow customer returns 
we regularly review and revise  as deemed necessary  our estimate of reserves for future sales returns based primarily upon historic trends and relevant current data 
we record estimated reserves for sales returns as a reduction of sales  cost of sales and accounts receivable 
returned products are recorded as inventories and are valued based upon estimated realizable value 
the physical condition and marketability of returned products are the major factors we consider in estimating realizable value 
actual returns  as well as estimated realizable values of returned products  may differ significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from our estimates  if factors such as economic conditions  inventory levels or competitive conditions differ from our expectations 
promotional allowances we have various performance based arrangements with certain retailers to reimburse them for all or a portion of their promotional activities related to our products 
these arrangements primarily allow customers to take deductions against amounts owed to us for product purchases 
estimated accruals for promotions and co operative advertising programs are recorded in the period in which the related revenue is recognized 
we review and revise the estimated accruals for the projected costs for these promotions 
actual costs incurred may differ significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from estimates if factors such as the level and success of the retailers programs or other conditions differ from our expectations 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value 
cost is principally determined by the first in  first out method 
we record adjustments to the cost of inventories based upon our sales forecast and the physical condition of the inventories 
these adjustments are estimates  which could vary significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from actual requirements if future economic conditions or competitive conditions differ from our expectations 
equipment and other long lived assets equipment  which includes tools and molds  is recorded at cost and is depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of such assets 
changes in circumstances such as technological advances  changes to our business model or changes in our capital spending strategy can result in the actual useful lives differing from our estimates 
in those cases where we determine that the useful life of equipment should be shortened  we would depreciate the net book value in excess of the salvage value  over its revised remaining useful life  thereby increasing depreciation expense 
factors such as changes in the planned use of equipment  or market acceptance of products  could result in shortened useful lives 
long lived assets  including trademarks  licenses  goodwill and other rights  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any such asset may not be recoverable 
if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows excluding interest is less than the carrying value  then we recognize an impairment loss  measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset 
the estimate of undiscounted cash flow is based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about expected future operating performance 
our estimates of undiscounted cash flow may differ from actual cash flow due to  among other things  economic conditions  changes to our business model or changes in consumer acceptance of our products 
in those cases where we determine that the useful life of other long lived assets should be shortened  we would depreciate the net book value in excess of the salvage value after testing for impairment as described above  over the revised remaining useful life of such asset thereby increasing amortization expense 
results of operations net sales years ended december  change change in millions prestige product sales mass market product sales total net sales net sales for the year ended december  increased to million 
for the year ended december   net sales were up 
at comparable foreign currency exchange rates  net sales rose and in and  respectively 
the increases in net sales are attributable to increases in our prestige product lines 
prestige product sales  which were up in  grew an additional in the global rollout of burberry brit for women  which began in the third quarter of  expanded to asia  south america and the middle east in early in addition  during the third quarter of  the burberry brit men s line was launched in the united kingdom  select countries in western europe and in the united states 
the excellent performance of burberry  burberry weekend and burberry touch  as well as the burberry brit collection all contributed to  and was the primary driver of  growth in prestige product sales in the year also included several brand extensions 
during the second quarter  we launched a limited edition warm weather seasonal fragrance for our celine and christian lacroix brands 
in july  we unveiled new fragrance families for both st dupont and paul smith and began distribution of lanvin products 
in june  inter parfums  sa entered into an exclusive  worldwide license agreement with lanvin sa to create  develop and distribute fragrance lines under the lanvin brand name 
the fifteen year license agreement took effect july  for the six months period ended december   net sales of lanvin products aggregated approximately million 
for the year ended december   net sales of lanvin products aggregated approximately million contributing to the increase in sales for although there were no major new fragrance families launched in for our most significant brands  was still a very active year 
in early  we introduced new christian lacroix and celine fragrance families 
in addition  a flanker fragrance  paul smith london floral  and a new lanvin fragrance  arpege pour homme were launched later in the year 
lastly  burberry brit gold a limited edition holiday fragrance debuted in time for the holiday season 
with respect to our mass market product lines  net sales were down in after falling in the sales decline experienced in has continued into and is again equally distributed between domestic and export customers 
we continue to believe that oil and gas prices are a significant cause for declining sales in the dollar store markets  as dollar store customers have less disposable cash 
in addition  sluggish economies in mexico and central and south america continue to affect our customers in those territories and we continue to closely monitor credit risk 
on july   we entered into an exclusive agreement with gap to develop  produce  manufacture and distribute personal care and home fragrance products for gap and banana republic brand names to be sold in gap and banana republic retail stores in the united states and canada

to propel these programs forward  these expenses are expected to continue in in addition  we are currently transitioning component sourcing and production of gap s existing fragrance and personal care product lines to suppliers and contract fillers of the company 
margins on initial sales to gap of their existing product lines are expected to be minimal  as we are honoring all existing purchase commitments 
our new product calendar is very ambitious  with new families of fragrances planned for all three of our largest brands

a new lanvin women s scent and a new paul smith men s scent are also in the works 
finally  new men scents for st dupont and nickel will also debut in in addition  we are actively pursuing other new business opportunities 
however  we cannot assure you that any new license or acquisitions will be consummated 
gross margins years ended december  in millions net sales cost of sales gross margin gross margin as a percent of net sales gross profit margins were in  in and in sales of products from our french based prestige fragrance lines generate significantly higher gross profit margins than sales of our united states based mass market product lines 
for  the gross margin improvement is attributable to sales of products from our french based prestige fragrance lines 
as previously discussed  in anticipation of the new terms of the burberry license  and to mitigate the associated expenses  we have been fine tuning our operating model 
this new model includes increased selling prices to distributors  modified cost sharing arrangements with suppliers and distributors  and the future formation of joint ventures or company owned subsidiaries within key markets to handle future distribution 
we increased our selling prices to distributors and modified our cost sharing arrangements with them in late and early the effect of these changes is the primary reason for our improved gross margin in in  a decline of approximately in gross margin as a percentage of sales for united states mass market operations was more than offset by an approximate improvement in gross margin as a percentage of sales for our french based prestige product lines 
the balance of the margin improvement in was the result of the net sales growth rate achieved in prestige product lines  as compared to the negative growth rate of our mass market product lines

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general we address certain financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that primarily consists of the use of derivative financial instruments 
we primarily enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts in order to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not engage in the trading of foreign currency forward exchange contracts or interest rate swaps 
foreign exchange risk management we periodically enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge exposure related to receivables denominated in a foreign currency and to manage risks related to future sales expected to be denominated in a foreign currency 
we enter into these exchange contracts for periods consistent with our identified exposures 
the purpose of the hedging activities is to minimize the effect of foreign exchange rate movements on the receivables and cash flows of inter parfums  sa  our french subsidiary  whose functional currency is the euro 
all foreign currency contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries and are with large financial institutions  which are rated as strong investment grade 
all derivative instruments are required to be reflected as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet measured at fair value 
generally  increases or decreases in fair value of derivative instruments will be recognized as gains or losses in earnings in the period of change 
if the derivative is designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedge  then the changes in fair value of the derivative instrument will be recorded in other comprehensive income 
before entering into a derivative transaction for hedging purposes  we determine that the change in the value of the derivative will effectively offset the change in the fair value of the hedged item from a movement in foreign currency rates 
then  we measure the effectiveness of each hedge throughout the hedged period 
any hedge ineffectiveness is recognized in the income statement 
we believe that our risk of loss as the result of nonperformance by any of such financial institutions is remote and in any event would not be material 
the contracts have varying maturities with none exceeding one year 
costs associated with entering into such contracts have not been material to our financial results 
at december   we had foreign currency contracts at inter parfums  sa in the form of forward exchange contracts in the amount of approximately us million and gb pounds million 
interest rate risk management we mitigate interest rate risk by continually monitoring interest rates  and then determining whether fixed interest rates should be swapped for floating rate debt  or if floating rate debt should be swapped for fixed rate debt 
we have entered into one interest rate swap to reduce exposure to rising variable interest rates  by effectively exchanging the variable interest rate of above the three month euribor rate on our long term to a variable rate based on the month euribor rate with a floor of and a ceiling of 
this derivative instrument is recorded at fair value and changes in fair value are reflected in the results of operation
