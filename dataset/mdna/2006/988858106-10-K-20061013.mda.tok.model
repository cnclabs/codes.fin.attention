item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and in notes to consolidated financial statements  all of which are incorporated herein by reference 
store operations our stores are designed to differentiate our brands  create an attractive environment  make shopping convenient and enjoyable  and maximize operating efficiencies  all of which should enhance the customer experience 
we focus on store layout  with particular focus on arrangement of display cases  lighting  and choice of materials to optimize merchandise presentation 
promotional displays are changed periodically to provide variety or to reflect seasonal events 
each of our stores is led by a store manager who is responsible for store level operations  including overall store sales and personnel matters 
administrative matters  including purchasing  distribution and payroll  are consolidated at the corporate level in an effort to maintain efficiency and low operating costs at the store level 
in addition to selling jewelry  each store also offers standard warranties and return policies  and provides extended warranty coverage that may be purchased at the customer s option 
in order to facilitate sales  stores will hold merchandise in layaway  generally requiring a deposit of not less than percent of the purchase price at the inception of the layaway transaction 
we have implemented inventory control systems  extensive security systems and loss prevention procedures to maintain low inventory losses 
we screen employment applicants and provide our store personnel with training in loss prevention 
despite such precautions  we experience losses from theft from time to time  and maintain insurance to cover such external losses 
we believe it is important to provide knowledgeable and responsive customer service and we maintain a strong focus on connecting with the customer  both through advertising and in store communications and service 
our goal is to service the customer from the first sale by maintaining a customer connection through client services 
we have a centralized customer service call center to more effectively address customer phone calls at lower aggregate cost 
we continue to focus on the level and frequency of our employee training programs  particularly with store managers and key sales associates 
we also provide training in sales techniques for new employees  on the job training for all store personnel and management training for store managers 
under the banner of zale corporation university  we offer training to employees at every level of the organization 
purchasing and inventory we purchase the majority of our merchandise in finished form from a network of established suppliers and manufacturers located primarily in the united states  southeast asia and italy 
all purchasing is done through buying offices at our headquarters 
as discussed in the section business initiatives and strategy  a centralized product sourcing organization also has been established to coordinate the purchase and assembly of core diamond products such as solitaire rings  earrings and pendants 
consignment inventory has historically consisted of test programs  merchandise at higher price points or merchandise that otherwise does not warrant the risk of ownership 
consignment merchandise can be returned to the vendor 
table of contents at any time or converted to owned inventory if it meets certain productivity thresholds 
we had approximately million and million of consignment inventory on hand at july  and  respectively 
during fiscal years and  we purchased approximately percent of our finished merchandise from our top five vendors  including more than six percent from one vendor in if our supply with these top vendors were disrupted  particularly at certain critical times during the year  our sales could be adversely affected in the short term until alternative supply arrangements could be established 
during fiscal year  our direct sourcing organization accounted for approximately six percent of our merchandise requirements 
in fiscal year  we expanded our use of forward contracts for the purchase of our gold and silver in order to reduce the effects of fluctuating commodity prices 
we generally hedge certain planned inventory purchases covering a designated period of no longer than twelve months and amounts consistent with our identified exposure 
the purpose of hedging activities is to minimize the effect of commodity price movements on cash flows 
all forward contracts are currently with four financial institutions rated as investment grade by a major rating agency 
no fees or up front payments are required when using these commodity forwards 
these contracts settle on a net basis 
as a specialty retail jeweler  we could be affected by industry wide fluctuations in the prices of diamonds  gold  and other metals and stones 
the supply and prices of diamonds in the principal world markets are significantly influenced by a single entity  the diamond trading company  which has traditionally controlled the marketing of a substantial majority of the world s supply of diamonds and sells rough diamonds to worldwide diamond cutters at prices determined in its sole discretion 
the availability of diamonds to the diamond trading company and our suppliers is to some extent dependent on the political situation in diamond producing countries and on continuation of prevailing supply and marketing arrangements for raw diamonds 
until alternate sources are developed  any sustained interruption in the supply of diamonds could adversely affect us and the retail jewelry industry as a whole 
the inverse is true with respect to any oversupply from diamond producing countries  which could cause diamond prices to fall 
within the jewelry industry there has been continued focus on conflict diamonds  which are allegedly extracted from war torn regions and sold by organizations to fund insurrection 
through an international system of certification and legislative initiatives  the diamond trade has taken steps to ensure the exclusion from the supply chain of these diamonds  which represent a small fraction of the world s supply 
it is not expected that such efforts  if successful  will substantially affect the supply of diamonds 
however  in the near term  efforts by non governmental organizations to encourage legislative response combined with an upcoming movie about conflict diamonds scheduled for national release in december could increase consumer awareness of the issue and could affect consumer demand for diamonds 
proprietary credit our private label credit card program helps facilitate the sale of merchandise to customers who wish to finance their purchases rather than use cash or other payment sources 
we offer revolving and interest free credit programs under our private label credit card program 
approximately percent and percent  respectively  of our us total sales excluding piercing pagoda  which does not offer proprietary credit  were generated by proprietary credit cards in fiscal years and our canadian propriety credit card sales represented approximately percent of canadian total sales for fiscal year and approximately percent of canadian total sales in fiscal year in fiscal year  we continued our proprietary credit offerings of same as cash  revolving and interest free programs  all of which allowed our sales personnel to provide the customer additional financing options 
in july  we entered into a ten year agreement with citi whereby citi issues private label credit cards branded with appropriate trademarks  and provides financing for our customers to purchase merchandise in exchange for payment by us of a merchant fee based on a percentage of each credit card sale 
the merchant fee varies according to the credit plan that is chosen by the customer ie  revolving  interest free  same as cash 

table of contents employees as of july   we had approximately  employees  approximately percent of whom were canadian employees and less than one percent of whom were represented by unions 
we usually hire temporary employees during each holiday season 
seasonality as a specialty retailer of fine jewelry  our business is seasonal in nature  with our second quarter  which includes the months of november through january  typically generating a proportionally greater percentage of annual sales  earnings from operations and cash flow than the other three quarters 
we expect such seasonality to continue 
information technology our technology systems provide information necessary for i store operations  ii sales and margin management  iii inventory control  iv profitability monitoring by many measures merchandise category  buyer  store  v customer care  vi expense control programs  and vii overall management decision support 
significant data processing systems include point of sale reporting  purchase order management  replenishment  warehouse management  merchandise planning and control  payroll  general ledger  sales audit  and accounts payable 
bar code ticketing and scanning are used at all point of sale terminals to ensure accurate sales and margin data compilation and to provide for inventory control monitoring 
information is made available online to merchandising staff on a timely basis  thereby increasing the merchants ability to be responsive to changes in customer behavior 
we are also improving the connectivity between stores and our corporate headquarters to enhance operating efficiencies and speed of transmission 
our information technology systems and processes allow management to monitor  review and control operational performance on a daily  monthly  quarterly and annual basis for each store and each transaction 
senior management can review and analyze activity by store  amount of sale  terms of sale or employees who sell the merchandise 
we have a data center operations services agreement with a third party for the management of our mainframe processing operations  client server systems  local area network operations  wide area network management and e commerce hosting 
the agreement  effective august   requires fixed payments totaling million over an month period plus a variable amount based on usage  and extends through we believe that by outsourcing our data center operations  we are focusing our resources on developing and enhancing the strategic initiatives discussed in the business and strategy section 
we have historically upgraded  and expect to continue to upgrade  our information systems to improve operations and support future growth 
we estimate we will make capital expenditures of approximately million in fiscal year for enhancements to our information systems and infrastructure 
regulation our operations are affected by numerous federal and state laws that impose disclosure and other requirements upon the origination  servicing and enforcement of credit accounts and limitations on the maximum amount of finance charges that may be charged by a credit provider 
in addition to our private label credit cards  credit to our customers is provided primarily through bank cards such as visa  mastercard  and discover 
any change in the regulation of credit which would materially limit the availability of credit to our traditional customer base could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 
we are subject to the jurisdiction of various state and other taxing authorities 
from time to time  these taxing authorities conduct reviews or audits of the company 
the sale of insurance products by us is also highly regulated 
state laws currently impose disclosure obligations with respect to our sale of credit and other insurance 
in addition  our sale of insurance products 
table of contents in connection with our private label credit cards appears to be subject to certain disclosure and other requirements under the gramm leach bliley act of our and our competitors practices are also subject to review in the ordinary course of business by the federal trade commission and our and other retail companies credit cards are subject to regulation by state and federal banking regulators 
we believe that we are currently in material compliance with all applicable state and federal regulations 
merchandise in the retail jewelry industry is frequently sold at a discount off the regular or original price 
we are subject to federal and state regulations requiring retailers offering merchandise at promotional prices to offer the merchandise at regular or original prices for stated periods of time 
additionally  we are subject to certain truth in advertising and various other laws  including consumer protection regulations that regulate retailers generally and or the promotion and sale of jewelry in particular 
we monitor changes in those laws and believe that we are in material compliance with applicable laws with respect to such practices

risk factors we make forward looking statements in the annual report on form k and in other reports we file with the sec 
in addition  members of our senior management make forward looking statements orally in presentations to analysts  investors  the media and others

table of contents if the general economy performs poorly  discretionary spending on goods that are  or are perceived to be luxuries may not grow and may even decrease 
jewelry purchases are discretionary and may be affected by adverse trends in the general economy and consumer perceptions of those trends 
in addition  a number of other factors affecting consumers such as employment  wages and salaries  business conditions  energy costs  credit availability and taxation policies  for the economy as a whole and in regional and local markets where we operate  can impact sales and earnings 
the concentration of a substantial portion of our sales in three relatively brief selling periods means that our performance is more susceptible to disruptions 
a substantial portion of our sales are derived from three selling periods holiday christmas  valentine s day  and mother s day 
because of the briefness of these three selling periods  the opportunity for sales to recover in the event of a disruption or other difficulty is limited  and the impact of disruptions and difficulties can be significant 
for instance  adverse weather such as a blizzard or hurricane  a significant interruption in the receipt of products whether because of vendor or other product problems  or a sharp decline in mall traffic occurring during one of these selling periods could materially impact sales for the affected period and  because of the importance of each of these selling periods  commensurately impact overall sales and earnings 
most of our sales are of products that include diamonds  precious metals and other commodities  and fluctuations in the availability and pricing of commodities could impact our ability to obtain and produce products at favorable prices 
the supply and price of diamonds in the principal world market are significantly influenced by a single entity  which has traditionally controlled the marketing of a substantial majority of the world s supply of diamonds and sells rough diamonds to worldwide diamond cutters at prices determined in its sole discretion 
the availability of diamonds also is somewhat dependent on the political conditions in diamond producing countries and on the continuing supply of raw diamonds 
any sustained interruption in this supply could have an adverse affect on our business 
in the near term  efforts by non governmental organizations to encourage legislative response combined with a movie about conflict diamonds scheduled for national release in december could increase consumer awareness of the issue and could affect consumer demand for diamonds 
we are also affected by fluctuations in the price of diamonds  gold and other commodities 
we historically have engaged in hedging against fluctuations in the cost of gold 
a significant change in prices of key commodities could adversely affect our business by reducing operating margins or decreasing consumer demand if retail prices are increased significantly 
our sales are dependent upon mall traffic 
our stores  kiosks  and carts are located primarily in shopping malls throughout the us  canada and puerto rico 
our success is in part dependent upon the continued popularity of malls as a shopping destination and the ability of malls  their tenants and other mall attractions to generate customer traffic 
accordingly  a significant decline in this popularity  especially if it is sustained  would substantially harm our sales and earnings 
we operate in a highly competitive and fragmented industry 
the retail jewelry business is highly competitive and fragmented  and we compete with nationally recognized jewelry chains as well as a large number of independent regional and local jewelry retailers and other types of retailers who sell jewelry and gift items  such as department stores  mass merchandisers and catalog showrooms 
we also are beginning to compete with internet sellers of jewelry 
because of the breadth and depth of this competition  we are constantly under competitive pressure that both constrains pricing and requires extensive merchandising efforts in order for us to remain competitive 

table of contents any failure by us to manage our inventory effectively will negatively impact sales and earnings 
we purchase much of our inventory well in advance of each selling period 
in the event we misjudge consumer preferences or demand  we will experience lower sales than expected and will have excessive inventory that may need to be written down in value or sold at prices that are less than expected 
because of our dependence upon a small concentrated number of landlords for a substantial number of our locations  any significant erosion of our relationships with those landlords would negatively impact our ability to obtain and retain store locations 
we are significantly dependent on our ability to operate stores in desirable locations with capital investment and lease costs that allow us to earn a reasonable return on our locations 
we depend on the leasing market and our landlords to determine supply  demand  lease cost and operating costs and conditions 
we cannot be certain as to when or whether desirable store locations will become or remain available to us at reasonable lease and operating costs 
further  several large landlords dominate the ownership of prime malls  and we are dependent upon maintaining good relations with those landlords in order to obtain and retain store locations on optimal terms 
from time to time  we do have disagreements with our landlords and a significant disagreement  if not resolved  could have an adverse impact on our business 
changes in regulatory requirements relating to the extension of credit may increase the cost of or adversely affect our operations 
our operations are affected by numerous us and canadian federal and state or provincial laws that impose disclosure and other requirements upon the origination  servicing and enforcement of credit accounts and limitations on the maximum aggregate amount of finance charges that may be charged by a credit provider 
any change in the regulation of credit including changes in the application of current laws which would materially limit the availability of credit to our customer base could adversely affect our sales and earnings 
any disruption in  or changes to  our private label credit card arrangement with citi may adversely affect our ability to provide consumer credit and write credit insurance 
our agreement with citi  through which citi provides financing for our customers to purchase merchandise through private label credit cards  enhances our ability to provide consumer credit and write credit insurance 
any disruption in  or change to  this agreement could have an adverse effect on our business  especially to the extent that it materially limits credit availability to our customer base 
acquisitions involve special risk  including the possibility that we may be unable to integrate new acquisitions into our existing operations 
we have made significant acquisitions in the past and may in the future make additional acquisitions 
difficulty integrating an acquisition into our existing infrastructure and operations may cause us to fail to realize expected return on investment through revenue increases  cost savings  increases in geographic or product presence and customer reach  and or other projected benefits from the acquisition 
additionally  attractive acquisition opportunities may not be available at the time or pursuant to terms acceptable to us 
we recently appointed a new ceo  who may initiate strategies or other changes in store levels  expenses  staffing  and related matters 
mary e 
burton was named acting chief executive officer in january and president and chief executive officer in july as discussed under business initiatives and strategy  we have a number of strategy initiatives and expect ms 
burton to initiate others 
each of these initiatives will require the commitment of capital and human resources 
these initiatives may or may not generate the expected results

management believes substantially all of the store leases expiring in fiscal year that it wishes to renew including leases which expired earlier and are currently being operated under month to month extensions will be renewed

bailey banks biddle store closings 
during the second quarter of fiscal year  we closed bailey banks biddle stores to improve performance and profitability 
we incurred a total of million or per diluted share after taxes  related to the bailey banks biddle closings for fiscal year american jobs creation act 
on october   the american jobs creation act the ajca was signed into law 
the ajca includes  among other provisions  a special one time deduction for percent of certain foreign earnings that are repatriated to the us from foreign operations  as defined in the ajca 
we have a canadian subsidiary for which we elected to apply this provision to qualifying earnings repatriations in fiscal year in january  we executed a domestic repatriation plan under the provision and repatriated million  realizing an income tax benefit of million partially offset by a liability of million related to management s decision not to elect apb for the fiscal year ending july  the net income tax benefit realized was million  or per diluted share for the fiscal year ended july  year ended july  compared to year ended july  total revenues 
total revenues for fiscal year were billion  an increase of approximately percent over total revenues of billion for the same period in the prior fiscal year 
total revenues include million this year and million last year from the bailey banks biddle stores that we closed during the second quarter 
excluding these stores  total revenues were billion  compared to billion last year  an increase of percent 
our comparable store sales increased approximately percent in fiscal year  compared to the prior fiscal year 
comparable store sales exclude amortization of esas and insurance premiums related to credit insurance policies sold to customers who purchase merchandise under our proprietary credit program  and include sales for those stores beginning their thirteenth full month of operation 
the results of stores that have been relocated  renovated or refurbished are included in the calculation of comparable store sales on the same basis as other stores 
however  stores closed for more than days due to unforeseen events hurricanes  etc 
are excluded from the calculation of comparable store sales 
with the exception of the piercing pagoda and zales jewelers brands  all our brands achieved positive comparable store sales results 
while the zales brand had an overall decrease in comparable store sales  the brand did benefit from an improved assortment of diamond solitaires and diamond fashion categories during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 
in connection with this shift in assortment  the zales brand increased inventory by approximately million in fiscal year  compared to the prior fiscal year 
piercing pagoda continues to be impacted by a decline in sales of the italian charms that have not been fully offset by increases in other categories 
the fine jewelry segment contributed billion of revenues in the fiscal year  compared to billion in fiscal year  which represents an increase of percent 
excluding the revenues from the closed bailey banks biddle stores  the fine jewelry segment contributed billion and billion in revenues for fiscal years and  respectively  an increase of approximately percent 
in the kiosk jewelry segment  revenues decreased to million from million in fiscal year  a decrease of percent 
all other segment operations provided approximately million in revenues compared to million in fiscal year  representing an increase of percent from the prior year 

table of contents during fiscal year  we opened stores in the fine jewelry segment and kiosks in the kiosk jewelry segment 
in addition  we closed stores in the fine jewelry segment  including the bailey banks biddle store closings  and locations in the kiosk jewelry segment during the current period 
cost of sales 
cost of sales includes cost of merchandise sold  as well as receiving and distribution costs 
cost of sales as a percentage of revenues was percent for fiscal year  an increase of basis points over last fiscal year 
the increase in cost of sales is primarily due to a special charge of basis points intended to accelerate the sell through of discontinued merchandise and an inventory charge of basis points related to closing certain bailey banks biddle stores 
we also experienced margin improvements driven by directly sourced goods of approximately basis points and more productive use of trade in product resulting in approximately basis points improvement 
these improvements were offset by increased promotions in the bailey banks biddle closed stores and the markdowns to sell through discontinued items in zales 
we recorded a lifo charge of million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year we estimate that the portion of the special charge on approximately million of inventory reduced the lifo charge by approximately million due to the liquidation of the inventory 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
included in selling  general and administrative expenses sg a are store operating  advertising  buying and general corporate overhead expenses 
sg a increased percentage points to percent of revenues for the current fiscal year  from percent of revenues for the prior year 
the increase in sg a of basis points was primarily the result of bailey banks biddle store closing costs basis points  executive severance basis points  adoption of sfas r basis points  termination of an it initiative that did not meet the needs of our business basis points  asset impairment charges primarily related to certain test stores basis points  and incremental store operating costs offset by a reduction in proprietary credit costs due to a shift to more profitable or less costly credit program offerings 
depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense was million in fiscal year  or percent of revenues  remaining flat to the prior fiscal year 
settlement of retirement plan obligations 
the settlement of certain retirement plan obligations resulted in a benefit of million before taxes in fiscal year derivatives gains losses 
we recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position measured at fair value 
any changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are reported in derivative gains losses on the consolidated statements of operations 
the fair market value of these instruments is subject to the changes in the underlying commodity 
the increase decrease in derivatives gain loss is due to the increase decrease in fair value of the derivative instruments 
in fiscal year  we recognized a loss before taxes in the amount of approximately million  representing less than one percent of revenues 
in connection with the audit of our financial statements  we determined that our forward contracts for the purchase of gold and silver to hedge fluctuations in inventory purchase costs did not meet the current interpretation of sfas for hedge treatment with regard to contemporaneous documentation of hedge effectiveness and effectiveness testing 
accordingly  all changes in the fair value of these instruments currently are recognized in our statement of operations  along with the related tax effects 
our failure to have in place a process for generating the documentation contemporaneously with the establishment of the derivative position was a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls 
subsequent to the end of our most recent fiscal quarter  we implemented changes intended to remediate the material weakness discussed above 
interest expense 
interest expense as a percent of revenues for the fiscal year was percent compared to percent in the prior fiscal year 
the increase in interest expense was the result of an increase in the weighted average effective interest rate from percent last year to percent this year  and an increase in average borrowings under the revolving credit agreement 

table of contents income taxes 
the effective tax rate for the fiscal years ended july   and was percent and percent  respectively 
the decrease in the effective tax rate was due to tax benefits associated with the repatriation under the american jobs creation act the ajca described below  the tax rate on canadian earnings  and the release of certain tax reserves upon resolution of certain state and local audits 
excluding the impact of the ajca and the impact of canadian changes on previously reserved items  the effective tax rate for fiscal year was percent 
on october   the ajca was signed into law 
the ajca includes  among other provisions  a special one time deduction for percent of certain foreign earnings that are repatriated to the us from foreign operations  as defined in the ajca 
we have a canadian subsidiary for which we elected to apply this provision to qualifying earnings repatriations in fiscal year in january  we executed a domestic repatriation plan under the provision and repatriated million  realizing an income tax benefit of million partially offset by a liability of million related to management s decision not to elect apb for the fiscal year ending july  the net income tax benefit realized was million  or per diluted share for the fiscal year ended july  year ended july  compared to year ended july  total revenues 
total revenues for fiscal year were billion  an increase of percent over total revenues for the prior fiscal year 
the overall increase in revenues during the fiscal year was partially offset by weaker revenues in the holiday period 
in addition  we estimate that revenues were adversely impacted by to million due to the hurricanes in florida  puerto rico  and alabama in august and september our comparable store sales increased percent for fiscal year as compared to the prior fiscal year 
comparable store sales exclude amortization of esas and include sales for those stores beginning their thirteenth full month of operation 
the results of stores that have been relocated  renovated  or refurbished are included in the calculation of comparable store sales on the same basis as other stores 
for the fiscal year  all brands had flat to positive comparable store sales with the exception of the zales brand  which had negative comparable sales primarily due to poor performance over the holiday period 
the fine jewelry brands contributed billion of revenues in fiscal year  compared to billion in fiscal year  which represented an increase of percent 
total revenues included million in the kiosk jewelry segment compared to million in fiscal year  an increase of percent over the prior year  which was primarily due to the expansion of this segment into canada

cost of sales 
cost of sales includes cost of merchandise sold  as well as receiving and distribution costs 
cost of sales as a percentage of revenues was percent for fiscal year  a decrease of percentage points over the prior fiscal year 
approximately percent of the increase was driven by our direct sourcing initiatives  which lowered costs on merchandise produced internally or purchased directly from factories  and percent resulted from a higher mix of esa sales  which have favorable costs as a percent of revenue 
these improvements were partially offset by a product mix shift to lower margin merchandise and higher clearance markdowns 
our lifo inventory charge was million and million for the fiscal years ended july  and  respectively 
selling general and administrative expenses 
included in sg a are store operating  advertising  buying and general corporate overhead expenses 
sg a increased percentage points to percent of revenues in fiscal year  from percent of revenues for fiscal year 
table of contents store operating expenses were approximately percentage points higher as a percent of revenues  principally a result of higher fixed occupancy expense as a rate of sales due to the under performance of the zales jewelers brand and sales lost to the hurricanes in the first two months of fiscal year advertising expenditures also increased by percent of sales due to our continued investments in marketing 
the increase in store operating expenses was partially offset by a reduction in proprietary credit expenses of approximately percentage points due to a change in the mix of our credit programs 
depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense was million in fiscal year  an increase of percent over fiscal year  primarily due to investments in new store growth and it systems 
income taxes 
the effective tax rate for the fiscal years ended july  and was percent and percent  respectively

liquidity and capital resources our cash requirements consist primarily of funding inventory growth  capital expenditures for new store growth  renovations of the existing store portfolio  and upgrades to our management information systems and distribution facilities and debt service 
as of july   we had cash and cash equivalents of million 
the retail jewelry business is highly seasonal  with a significant proportion of sales and operating income being generated in november and december of each year 
approximately percent of our annual revenues were generated during the three months ended january  and january   respectively  which includes the holiday selling season 
our working capital requirements fluctuate during the year  historically increasing substantially up to million during the fall season as a result of higher planned seasonal inventory levels in preparation for holiday 
primarily as a result of the repositioning of inventory in the zales brand  we expect inventory to fluctuate to higher levels than in prior years through the fall of calendar year the increase in long term debt compared to july  is partially due to the timing of certain income tax payments which in the past had been made in subsequent periods  cash outflows associated with the bailey banks biddle store closings  and an increase in the share repurchase program and operating earnings 
borrowings on long term debt reached a maximum of million in fiscal year in july  we deferred vendor payments of approximately million related to domestic operations and approximately million related to international operations into august this effectively shifted net cash outflows of million from fiscal year to fiscal year  thereby increasing net cash flows provided by operating activities for fiscal year with a commensurate decrease for fiscal year cash flow activities net cash provided by operating activities was million and million for fiscal years and  respectively 
in fiscal year  the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to the increase in inventory by million excluding the impact of inventory write downs of approximately million 
at july   owned inventory was approximately million higher than at july  primarily due to an increase in directly sourced product for the fine jewelry segment which results in earlier receipt of raw materials than finished goods  and increased assortments resulting from the repositioning of the zales brand 
net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal year  related to capital expenditures of million for new store openings  renovations and refurbishments and net purchases of investments 
the increase in capital expenditures from the prior year is primarily due to investments in new store growth and it system infrastructure

the financial accounting standards board fasb released interpretation  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  in june interpretation supplements fasb statement  accounting for income taxes  by defining the threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax positions in the financial statements 
interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  therefore  we will adopt interpretation for fiscal year ending july  at adoption  our financial statements will be adjusted to reflect those positions that are more likely than not to be sustained at the adoption date 
we will record any necessary adjustments directly to retained earnings on august  as a change in accounting principle 
over the next fiscal year  we will begin the process of reassessing our worldwide historical tax positions in order to apply interpretation at this time  we do not anticipate this will result in a material adjustment to our results of operations  balance sheet or cashflows 

table of contents inflation in management s opinion  changes in net revenues  net earnings  and inventory valuation that have resulted from inflation and increasing costs have not been material during the periods presented 
the trends in inflation rates pertaining to merchandise inventories  especially as they relate to gold and diamond costs  are primary components in determining our last in  first out lifo inventory 
current market trends indicate rising diamond prices 
if such trends continue  our lifo provision could be impacted 
we currently hedge a portion of our gold and silver purchases through forward contracts 
inflation may materially affect us in the future 
critical accounting policies and estimates our accounting and financial reporting policies are in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting policies requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
for example  unexpected changes in market conditions or a downturn in the economy could adversely affect actual results 
estimates are used in accounting for  among other things  merchandise inventory valuation  goodwill and long lived asset valuation  lifo inventory retail method  legal liability  credit insurance liability  product warranty  depreciation  employee benefits  workers compensation  tax  and contingencies 
estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period they are determined to be necessary 
management believes the following accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
merchandise inventories 
merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
substantially all us inventories represent finished goods which are valued using the lifo retail inventory method 
merchandise inventory of peoples jewellers and mappins jewellers of canada is valued using the first in  first out fifo retail inventory method 
under the retail method  inventory is segregated into categories of merchandise with similar characteristics at its current average retail selling value 
the determination of inventory at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying an average cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventory 
at the end of fiscal year  approximately seven percent of our total inventory represented raw materials and other inventory associated with internally sourced product 
this inventory is valued at the weighted average cost of the items 
we are required to determine the lifo cost on an interim basis by estimating annual inflation trends  annual purchases and ending inventory levels for the fiscal year 
actual annual inflation rates and inventory balances as of the end of any fiscal year may differ from interim estimates 
we apply internally developed indices that we believe accurately and consistently measure inflation or deflation in the components of our merchandise ie  diamonds  gold and other metals and precious stones and our overall merchandise mix 
we believe our internally developed indices more accurately reflect inflation or deflation in our own prices than the us bureau of labor statistics bls producer price indices or other published indices 
we also reduce our inventory valuation for discontinued  slow moving and damaged inventory 
this write down of inventory is equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and its estimated market value based upon assumptions of targeted inventory turn rates  future demand  management strategy  and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management or management strategy changes  additional inventory write downs may be required and  in the case of a major change in strategy or downturn in market conditions  such write downs could be significant 
for example  in fiscal year  we recorded inventory write downs of million resulting from the decision to accelerate the clearance of previously discontinued merchandise assortments and million to the closure of bailey banks biddle stores 
shrinkage is estimated for the period from the last inventory date to the end of the fiscal year on a store by store basis 
such estimates are based on experience and the shrinkage results from the last physical inventory 
physical inventories are taken at least once annually for all store locations and for the 
table of contents distribution centers 
the shrinkage rate from the most recent physical inventory  in combination with historical experience and significant changes in physical inventory results could impact our shrinkage reserve 
long lived assets and goodwill 
long lived assets are periodically reviewed for impairment by comparing the carrying value of the assets with their estimated undiscounted future cashflows 
if the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable  the potential impairment is measured based on a projected discounted cash flow method  using a discount rate that is considered to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
assumptions are made with respect to cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets based upon updated projections 
any changes in key assumptions  particularly store performance or market conditions  could result in an unanticipated impairment charge 
for instance  in the event of a major market downturn or adverse developments within a particular market or portion of our business  individual stores may become unprofitable  which could result in a write down of the carrying value of the assets located in those stores 
any impairment would be recognized in operating results 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we test goodwill for impairment annually  at the end of our second quarter  or more frequently if events occur which indicate a potential reduction in the fair value of a reporting unit s net assets below its carrying value 
an impairment is deemed to exist if the estimated fair value is less than the net book value of a reporting unit 
we calculate estimated fair value using the present value of future cash flows expected to be generated using a weighted average cost of capital and updated financial projections 
based upon the amounts currently recorded as goodwill  recent performance and estimated projections  we believe the likelihood of additional impairment would not be material 
however  a significant change in the related brand s performance  such as the closing of a majority of the brand s stores  could result in additional impairment 
in the second quarter of fiscal year  we performed our annual review for impairment of goodwill related to our piercing pagoda inc  people s jewellers and other smaller acquisitions 
we concluded that there was no evidence of impairment related to the goodwill of approximately million for our piercing pagoda acquisition  million recorded for the people s jewellers acquisition and million for other smaller acquisitions 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition 
revenue related to merchandise sales  which is approximately percent of total revenues  is recognized at the time of the sale  reduced by a provision for sales returns 
the provision for sales returns is based on historical evidence of our return rate 
repair revenues are recognized when the service is complete and the merchandise is delivered to the customers 
total revenues include two warranty programs esas that cover sizing and breakage for a two year period on certain products purchased from us  and sales from a diamond commitment program dcp that offers a traditional warranty to cover sizing and breakage for a month period  as well as theft replacement coverage for the same month period 
the revenues from these agreements are recognized over the service period at the rates the related costs are expected to be incurred in performing covered services under the agreements 
any significant change in the proportion of costs expected to be incurred in performing services under the agreements could result in a change in the amount of revenue recognized 
for instance  a five percent change on an annual basis in the timing of services under these agreements could result in a five percent change in the revenue recognized 
revenues also include premiums from our insurance businesses  principally related to credit insurance policies sold to customers who purchase our merchandise under the proprietary credit program 
insurance premiums are recognized over the coverage period 
other reserves 
we are involved in a number of legal and governmental proceedings as part of the normal course of business 
reserves are established based on management s best estimates of our potential liability in these matters 
these estimates have been developed in consultation with in house and outside counsel and are based on a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
income taxes are estimated for each jurisdiction in which we operate 
this involves assessing the current tax exposure together with temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial statement accounting purposes 
any resulting deferred tax assets are evaluated for recoverability based on estimated future taxable income 
to the extent that recovery is deemed not likely  a valuation allowance is recorded 
we believe that as of july   the realization of our gross deferred tax assets is more likely than not and thus there was no valuation reserve recorded

table of contents special charge 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we recorded an after tax special charge primarily consisting of million to accelerate inventory markdowns on discontinued items  million related to the termination of an information technology initiative not consistent with needs of the business  and a million asset impairment related to certain test stores

bailey banks biddle store closings 
during the second quarter of fiscal year  we closed bailey banks biddle stores to improve performance and profitability 
we incurred a total of million or per diluted share after taxes  related to the bailey banks biddle closings for fiscal year american jobs creation act 
on october   the american jobs creation act the ajca was signed into law 
the ajca includes  among other provisions  a special one time deduction for percent of certain foreign earnings that are repatriated to the us from foreign operations  as defined in the ajca 
we have a canadian subsidiary for which we elected to apply this provision to qualifying earnings repatriations in fiscal year in january  we executed a domestic repatriation plan under the provision and repatriated million  realizing an income tax benefit of million partially offset by a liability of million related to management s decision not to elect apb for the fiscal year ending july  the net income tax benefit realized was million  or per diluted share for the fiscal year ended july  texas margin tax 
in may  the texas legislature enacted a new law that changes the present texas franchise tax system and replaces it with a new tax system  the texas margin tax 
the texas margin tax is a significant change because it generally makes all legal entities subject to tax  including general and limited partnerships  while the current franchise tax system applies only to corporations and limited liability companies 
we conduct a portion of our operations through texas limited partnerships and will become subject to the new texas margin tax 
we will comply with the texas margin tax effective january  the computation of the tax liability will be based on revenues as of july   as reduced by certain deductions 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas  which require that deferred tax assets and liabilities be adjusted for the effects of new income tax legislation in the period of enactment  we estimated the net charge to deferred tax expense is immaterial 
the estimate is based on the texas margin tax law in its current form 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  which may adversely affect our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in seeking to minimize the risks from interest rate fluctuations  we manage exposures through our regular operating and financing activities 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and are not party to any leveraged financial instruments 
we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily through our borrowing activities  which are described under long term debt in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the investments of our insurance subsidiaries  primarily stocks and bonds  had an approximate market value at july  of million 
based on our market risk sensitive instruments including variable rate debt outstanding at july   we have determined that there was no material market risk exposure to our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows as of such date 
commodity risk 
we principally address commodity risk through retail price point adjustments and commodity price hedging 
while commodity risk exposure to diamond price fluctuation is not currently hedged by financial instruments  we do enter into forward contracts for the purchase of gold and silver in order to reduce the effects of fluctuating costs of these commodities 
we generally hedge certain planned inventory purchases covering a designated period of no longer than twelve months and amounts consistent with our identified exposure 
the purpose of the hedging activities is to minimize the effect of unknown future commodity price movements on planned cash flows and to enable us to maintain a consistent and predictable pricing strategy 
all forward contracts are currently with four financial institutions rated as investment grade by a major rating agency 
no fees or up front payments are required when using these commodity forwards 
these contracts settle on a net basis 
we currently account for these forward contracts as undesignated derivative instruments 
accounting for our forward contracts as derivatives instead of hedges does not affect the underlying economics of our risk management strategies and has no impact on the timing or amount of cash flows under any derivative contract 
the fair value of our derivative instruments is included in the consolidated balance sheets 
these fair values are obtained from outside counterparties and verified with internal discounted cash flow models 
during the term of the contracts  any changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are reported in derivative gains losses on the consolidated statements of operations 
the fair market value of these instruments is subject to the changes in the value of the underlying commodity 
in the year ended july   gold fluctuated significantly  between a low of per ounce to a high of per ounce 
at july   the price of gold was per ounce 
based on our outstanding contracts as of july   we would record a derivatives gain before taxes of approximately million if gold prices increase to the high a percent increase from the july  price 
in turn  if gold prices were to decrease to the low a percent decrease from the july  price  we would record a derivatives loss before taxes of approximately million 
at july   the mark to market value of our outstanding forward contracts was a net loss before taxes of million 
as of october   the market price of gold had decreased to per ounce 
based on our contracts outstanding as of july   such a decrease would result in a derivatives loss before taxes of approximately million 
while we realize a gain or loss on the derivative contract  we typically see a compensating gain or loss in the purchase cost of our products 
we have classified cash activity associated with derivatives as an operating activity in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
for additional information related to forward contracts  see notes to consolidated financial statements derivative financial instruments 

table of contents foreign currency contracts 
we are not subject to substantial currency fluctuations because most of our purchases are us dollar denominated 
however  as a result of our canadian operations  we are exposed to market risk from currency exchange rate exposure which may adversely affect our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in seeking to minimize this risk  we manage exposures through foreign currency exchange contracts 
in past fiscal years  we entered into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to reduce the effects of fluctuating currency exchange rates 
we enter into forward currency exchange contracts with terms that are no longer than twelve months 
these contracts are used to hedge certain forecasted inventory  advertising  and purchases relating to real estate activities anticipated to be incurred each fiscal year  denominated in foreign currencies for periods and amounts consistent with our identified exposures 
the purpose of the hedging activities is to minimize the effect of foreign exchange rate movements on cash flows 
when utilized  all foreign currency forward exchange contracts are denominated in canadian dollars and are with financial institutions rated as investment grade by a major rating agency 
no fees or up front payments are required when using these foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
in fiscal year  we did not enter into any foreign currency forward exchange contracts
