table of contents under the financial institutions reform  recovery and enforcement act of  the aggregate amount of loans that the bank is permitted to make to any one borrower is generally limited to of unimpaired capital and surplus if the security for such loan has a readily ascertainable value or for certain residential development loans 
at december   based upon the limitation  the bank s regulatory limit for loans to one borrower was approximately million 
at december   the dollar amount of outstanding loans to one group of related borrowers exceeded this amount  but some of the loans included in these loan totals were exempt from the lending limit because a some of the collateral securing these loans was certificates of deposit or marketable securities held by the bank  providing the bank with an expanded lending limit and b under the direct benefit and common enterprise rules of the financial institutions reform  recovery and enforcement act of  a portion of these loans do not really benefit the same individual borrower 
the total loans outstanding to this borrower at december  were million 
the borrower also had  of additional approved but undrawn credit available at december  the amount outstanding  excluding those loans that were exempt from the loans to one borrower limits because of the direct benefit and common enterprise rules  or because they were secured by deposits was million

the bank s commercial loan officers committee has the authority to approve loans that meet the commercial loan policy guidelines that are less than million 
individual loans of million or more  and loans to borrowers with aggregate lending relationships that exceed that amount  must be approved by the company s board of directors or its executive commercial loan committee 
the bank generally requires title insurance on its mortgage loans as well as fire and extended coverage casualty insurance in amounts at least equal to the principal amount of the loan or the value of improvements on the property 
the bank also requires flood insurance to protect the property securing its interest when the property is located in a flood plain 
one to four family residential real estate lending 
at december  the company s one to four family real estate loans  consisting of both fixed rate and adjustable rate loans  totaled million  a decline of million  from million at december  this decrease in the one to four family loans is consistent with the company s strategy of changing the composition of its portfolio toward shorter term commercial real estate and commercial business loans 
the company offers conventional fixed rate one to four family loans that have maximum terms of years 
in order to manage interest rate risk  the company sells the majority of fixed rate loan originations or refinances with terms to maturity of years or greater that are eligible for sale in the secondary market 
the interest rates 
table of contents charged on the fixed rate loan products are based on the fnma delivery rates  as well as other competitive factors 
the company also originates a limited number of fixed rate loans with terms up to years that are insured by the federal housing authority  veterans administration  minnesota housing finance agency or iowa finance authority 
the company also offers one year adjustable rate mortgages arms at a margin generally to basis points over the yield on the average monthly one year us treasury constant maturity index for terms of up to years 
the arm loans offered by the company allow the borrower to select subject to pricing an initial period of one year  three years  or five years between the loan origination and the date the first interest rate change occurs 
the arms generally have a basis point annual interest rate change cap and a lifetime cap of basis points over or under the initial rate 
initial interest rates offered on the arm loans during ranged from basis points below the fully indexed loan rate to basis points over that rate 
all borrowers are qualified for the loan at the fully indexed rate 
the company s originated arms do not permit negative amortization of principal  generally do not contain prepayment penalties and are not convertible into fixed rate loans 
in underwriting one to four family residential real estate loans  the company evaluates the borrower s credit history  ability to make principal  interest and escrow payments  the value of the property that will secure the loan  and debt to income ratios 
properties securing one to four family residential real estate loans made by the company are appraised by independent fee appraisers 
the company originates residential mortgage loans with loan to value ratios up to for owner occupied homes and up to for non owner occupied homes  however  private mortgage insurance is generally required to reduce the company s exposure to of value or less on most loans 
the company generally seeks to underwrite its loans in accordance with secondary market standards 
the company s residential mortgage loans customarily include due on sale clauses giving it the right to declare the loan immediately due and payable in the event that  among other things  the borrower sells or otherwise disposes of the property subject to the mortgage 
fixed rate loans in the company s portfolio include both growing equity mortgage gem loans and conventional fixed rate loans 
the gem loans require payments that increase after the first year 
under the gem loans  the monthly payments required for the first year are established based on a year amortization schedule 
depending upon the program selected  the payments may increase in the succeeding years by amounts ranging from to 
most of the gem loans originated by the company provide for at least four annual payment increases over the first five years of the loan 
the increased payments required under gem loans are applied to principal and have the effect of shortening the term to maturity  the gem loans do not permit negative amortization 
the company currently offers one gem product with a contractual maturity of approximately years 
the gems are generally priced based upon loans with similar contractual maturities 
the gems are popular with consumers who anticipate future increases in income and who desire an amortization schedule of less than years 
low mortgage interest rates over the past several years have decreased the demand for gem loans as consumers have opted for shorter term fixed rate loans 
commercial real estate and multi family lending 
the company originates permanent commercial real estate and multi family loans secured by properties located primarily in its market area 
it also purchases participations in commercial real estate and multi family loans originated by third parties on properties outside of its market area 
the commercial real estate and multi family loan portfolio includes loans secured by motels  hotels  apartment buildings  churches  ethanol plants  office buildings  business facilities  shopping malls  nursing homes  golf courses  entertainment facilities  warehouses and other non residential building properties primarily located in the upper midwest part of the united states 
permanent commercial real estate and multi family loans are generally originated for a maximum term of years and may have longer amortization periods with balloon maturity features 
the interest rates may be fixed for the term of the loan or have adjustable features that are tied to the prime rate or a published index 
commercial real estate and multi family loans are generally written in amounts up to of the lesser of the appraised value of the property or the purchase price and generally have a debt service coverage ratio of at least 
the debt 
table of contents service coverage ratio is the ratio of net cash from operations to debt service payments 
the company may originate construction loans secured by commercial or multi family real estate  or may purchase participation interests in third party originated construction loans secured by commercial or multi family real estate 
appraisals on commercial real estate and multi family real estate properties are performed by independent appraisers prior to the time the loan is made 
for transactions less than  the company may use an internal valuation 
all appraisals on commercial and multi family real estate are reviewed and approved by a commercial loan officer  credit manager  commercial department manager  or a qualified third party 
the bank s underwriting procedures require verification of the borrower s credit history  income and financial statements  banking relationships and income projections for the property 
all commercial real estate and multi family loans over million must be approved by a majority of the commercial loan committee prior to closing 
the commercial loan policy generally requires personal guarantees from the proposed borrowers 
an initial on site inspection is generally required for all collateral properties for loans with balances in excess of  independent annual reviews are performed for aggregate commercial lending relationships that exceed  the reviews cover financial performance  documentation completeness and accuracy of loan risk ratings 
at december   the company s two largest commercial real estate loans totaled million and million 
these loans are secured by separate golf course housing developments in southeastern minnesota and were performing at december  multi family and commercial real estate loans generally present a higher level of risk than loans secured by one to four family residences 
this greater risk is due to several factors  including the concentration of principal in a limited number of loans and borrowers  the effects of general economic conditions on income producing properties and the increased difficulty of evaluating and monitoring these types of loans 
furthermore  the repayment of loans secured by multi family and commercial real estate is typically dependent upon the successful operation of the related real estate project 
if the cash flow from the project is reduced for example  if leases are not obtained or renewed  the borrower s ability to repay the loan may be impaired 
at december    of loans in the commercial real estate portfolio were nonperforming 
there were two nonperforming loans in this category at december  with the largest one being a  loan secured by a hotel 
there can be no assurance that the amount of nonperforming loans will not increase in the future 
construction lending 
the company makes construction loans to individuals for the construction of their residences and to builders for the construction of one to four family residences 
it also makes some loans to builders for houses built on speculation 
construction loans also include commercial real estate loans 
almost all loans to individuals for the construction of their residences are structured as permanent loans 
such loans are made on the same terms as residential loans  except that during the construction phase  which typically lasts up to seven months  the borrower pays interest only 
generally  the borrower also pays a construction fee at the time of origination equal to the origination fee plus other costs associated with processing the loan 
residential construction loans are underwritten pursuant to the same guidelines used for originating residential loans on existing properties 
construction loans to builders or developers of one to four family residences generally carry terms of one year or less and may permit the payment of interest from loan proceeds 
construction loans to owner occupants are generally made in amounts up to of the lesser of cost or appraised value  but no more than of the loan proceeds can be disbursed until the building is completed 
the company generally limits the loan to value ratios on loans to builders to 
prior to making a commitment to fund a construction loan  the company requires a valuation of the property  financial data  and verification of the borrower s income 
the company obtains personal guarantees for substantially all of its construction loans to builders 
personal financial statements of guarantors are also obtained as part of the loan underwriting process 
construction loans are generally located in the company s market area 

table of contents construction loans are obtained principally through continued business from builders and developers who have previously borrowed from the bank  as well as referrals from existing customers and walk in customers 
the application process includes a submission to the bank of accurate plans  specifications and costs of the project to be constructed 
these items are used as a basis to determine the appraised value of the subject property to be built 
at december  construction loans totaled million  of which one to four family residential totaled million  multi family residential totaled million and commercial real estate totaled million 
the nature of construction loans makes them more difficult to evaluate and monitor 
the risk of loss on a construction loan is dependent largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the property s value upon completion of the project  experience of the builder  and the estimated cost including interest of the project 
if the estimate of value proves to be inaccurate  the company may be confronted  at or prior to the maturity of the loan  with a project having a value that is insufficient to assure full repayment and or the possibility of having to make substantial investments to complete and sell the project 
because defaults in repayment may not occur during the construction period  it may be difficult to identify problem loans at an early stage 
in these cases  the company may be required to modify the terms of the loan 
consumer lending 
the company originates a variety of consumer loans  including home equity loans open end and closed end  automobile  home improvement  mobile home  lot loans  deposit account and other loans for household and personal purposes 
consumer loan terms vary according to the type and value of collateral  length of contract and creditworthiness of the borrower 
the company s consumer loans are made at fixed or adjustable interest rates  with terms up to years for secured loans and up to three years for unsecured loans 
the company s home equity loans are written so that the total commitment amount  when combined with the balance of any other outstanding mortgage liens  may not exceed of the appraised value of the property 
the closed end home equity loans are written with fixed or adjustable rates with terms up to years 
the open end home equity lines are written with an adjustable rate with a year draw period that requires interest only payments followed by a year repayment period that fully amortizes the outstanding balance 
the consumer may access the open end home equity line either by making a withdrawal at the bank or writing a check on the home equity line of credit account 
open and closed end equity loans  which are generally secured by second mortgages on the borrower s principal residence  represented of the consumer loan portfolio at december  the underwriting standards employed by the bank for consumer loans include a determination of the applicant s payment history on other debts and ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan 
although creditworthiness of the applicant is of primary consideration  the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the security  if any  in relation to the proposed loan amount 
consumer loans may entail greater credit risk than do residential mortgage loans  particularly in the case of consumer loans that are unsecured or are secured by rapidly depreciable assets  such as automobiles or mobile homes 
in these cases  any repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance as a result of the greater likelihood of damage  loss or depreciation 
in addition  consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower s continuing financial stability  and thus are more likely to be affected by adverse personal circumstances 
furthermore  the application of various federal and state laws  including bankruptcy and insolvency laws  may limit the amount that can be recovered on such loans 
at december    of the consumer loan portfolio was non performing 
there can be no assurance that the amount of nonperforming loans will not increase in the future 
commercial business lending 
in order to satisfy the demand for financial services to individuals and businesses in its market area  the company maintains a portfolio of commercial business loans primarily to retail and manufacturing operations and professional firms 
the company s commercial business loans generally have terms ranging from six months to five years and may have either fixed or variable interest rates 
the company s commercial business loans generally include personal guarantees and are usually  but not always  secured by 
table of contents business assets such as inventory  equipment  leasehold interests in equipment  fixtures  real estate and accounts receivable 
the underwriting process for commercial business loans includes consideration of the borrower s financial statements  tax returns  projections of future business operations and inspection of the subject collateral  if any 
the company also purchases participation interests in commercial business loans originated outside of the company s market area from third party originators 
these loans generally have underlying collateral of inventory or equipment and repayment periods of less than ten years 
unlike residential mortgage loans  which generally are made on the basis of the borrower s ability to make repayment from his or her income  and which are secured by real property with more easily ascertainable value  commercial business loans are of higher risk and typically are made on the basis of the borrower s ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the borrower s business 
as a result  the availability of funds for the repayment of commercial business loans may be substantially dependent on the success of the business itself 
furthermore  the collateral securing the loans may depreciate over time  may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value based on the success of the business 
at december    of loans in the commercial business loan portfolio were non performing 
there can be no assurance that the amount of nonperforming loans will not increase in the future 
originations  purchases and sales of loans and mortgage backed and related securities real estate loans are generally originated by the company s staff of salaried and commissioned loan officers 
loan applications are taken in all branch and loan production offices 
the company originates both fixed and adjustable rate loans  however  its ability to originate loans is dependent upon the relative customer demand for loans in its markets 
demand for adjustable rate loans is affected by the interest rate environment 
the company originated for its portfolio million of one to four family adjustable rate loans during  a decrease of million  from million in  compared to million in the company also originated for its portfolio million of fixed rate one to four family loans during  a decrease of million  from million for  compared to million for during the past several years  the company has focused its portfolio loan origination efforts on commercial real estate  commercial business and consumer loans because these loans have terms to maturity and adjustable interest rate characteristics that are generally more beneficial to the company than single family fixed rate conventional loans 
the company originated million of multi family and commercial real estate  commercial business and consumer loans which excludes commercial real estate loans in construction or development during  an increase of million  from originations of million for  compared to million for in order to supplement loan demand in the company s market area and geographically diversify its loan portfolio  the company purchases participations in real estate loans from selected sellers  with yields based upon current market rates 
the company reviews and underwrites all loans purchased to ensure that they meet the company s underwriting standards and the seller generally continues to service the loans 
the company purchased million of loans during  a decrease of million  from million during  compared to million during the majority of the purchased one to four family loans have interest rates that are fixed for a one  three or five year period and then adjust annually thereafter 
the purchased commercial real estate and commercial business loans have terms and interest rates that are similar in nature to the company s originated commercial and business portfolio

federal regulations require that each savings institution classify its assets on a regular basis 
in addition  in connection with examinations of savings institutions  the office of thrift supervision ots and the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic examiners may identify problem assets and  if appropriate  require them to be classified 
there are three classifications for problem assets substandard  doubtful and loss 
assets classified as substandard have one or more defined weaknesses and are characterized by the distinct possibility that the bank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected 
assets classified as doubtful have the weaknesses of those classified as substandard  with additional characteristics that make collection or liquidation in full on the basis of currently existing facts  conditions and values questionable  and there is a high possibility of loss 
an asset classified as loss is considered uncollectible and of such little value that continuance as an asset on the balance sheet of the institution is not warranted 
assets classified as substandard or doubtful require the institution to establish prudent general allowances for loan losses 
if an asset  or portion thereof  is classified as loss  the institution must either establish specific allowances for loan losses in the amount of of the portion of the asset classified as loss  or charge off such amount 
if an institution does not agree with an ots or fdic examiner s classification of an asset  it may appeal the determination to the ots district director or the 
table of contents appropriate fdic personnel  depending on the regulator 
on the basis of management s review of its assets  at december   the bank classified a total of million of its loans and other assets as follows commercial one to four and commercial other dollars in thousands family multi family consumer business assets total substandard doubtful loss total the bank s classified assets consist of non performing loans and loans and other assets of concern discussed herein 
as of the date of this report  these asset classifications are materially consistent with those of the ots and fdic 
delinquency procedures 
when a borrower fails to make a required payment on a loan  the company attempts to cure the delinquency by contacting the borrower 
a late notice is sent on all loans over days delinquent 
additional written and verbal contacts are made with the borrower between and days after the due date 
if the loan is contractually delinquent days  the company sends a day demand letter to the borrower and after the loan is contractually delinquent days  institutes appropriate action to foreclose on the property 
if foreclosed  the property is sold at a sheriff s sale and may be purchased by the company 
delinquent consumer loans are generally handled in a similar manner 
the company s procedures for repossession and sale of consumer collateral are subject to various requirements under state consumer protection laws 
real estate acquired by the company as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure is classified as real estate in judgment for six to twelve months and thereafter as real estate owned until it is sold 
when property is acquired or expected to be acquired by foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure  it is recorded at the lower of cost or estimated fair value  less the estimated cost of disposition 
after acquisition  all costs incurred in maintaining the property are expensed 
costs relating to the development and improvement of the property  however  are capitalized to the extent of fair value less disposition cost

the bank offers a variety of deposit accounts having a wide range of interest rates and terms 
the bank s deposits consist of passbook  negotiable order of withdrawal now  money market  non interest bearing checking and certificate accounts including individual retirement accounts to retail and commercial business customers 
the bank relies primarily on competitive pricing policies and customer service to attract and retain these deposits 
the variety of deposit accounts offered by the bank has allowed it to be competitive in obtaining funds and to respond with flexibility to changes in consumer demand 
as customers have become more interest rate conscious  the bank has become more susceptible to short term fluctuations in deposit flows 
the bank manages the pricing of its deposits in keeping with its asset liability management  profitability and growth objectives 
based on its experience  the bank believes that its passbook  now  and money market accounts are relatively stable sources of deposits 
however  the ability of the bank to attract and maintain certificate deposits  and the rates paid on these deposits  has been and will continue to be significantly affected by market conditions

each fhlb credit program has its own interest rate  which may be fixed or variable  and range of maturities 
the fhlb may prescribe the acceptable uses for these advances  as well as limitations on the size of the advances and repayment provisions 
consistent with its asset liability management strategy  the bank has utilized fhlb advances from time to time to fund loan demand and extend the term to maturity of its liabilities 
the bank also uses short term fhlb borrowings to offset short term cash needs due to deposit outflows or loan fundings 
at december   the bank had million of fhlb advances outstanding

the bank competes for loans principally on the basis of the interest rates and loan fees it charges  the types of loans it originates and the quality of services it provides to borrowers 
competition for deposits is principally from mutual funds  securities firms  commercial banks  credit unions and other savings institutions located in the same communities and those that operate through internet banking operations throughout the continental united states

holding company regulation an entity that owns a savings association is a savings and loan holding company slhc 
if a holding company owns more than one savings association  it is a multiple slhc  if it owns only one savings association  it is a unitary slhc 
hmn is a unitary slhc 
the home owners loan act hola historically limited multiple slhcs and their non association subsidiaries to financial activities and services and to activities authorized for bank holding companies  but unitary slhcs  in the past  were not subject to restrictions on the activities that could be conducted by holding companies or their affiliates 
in november of the gramm leach bliley act the glb act was signed into law 
the glb act made significant changes to laws regulating the financial services industry 
changes included a new framework in which bank holding companies can own securities firms  insurance companies and other financial companies  prohibitions on new unitary slhcs from engaging in non financial activities or affiliating with non financial entities  new consumer protections associated with the transfer and use of non public personal information by financial institutions  and modifications to the federal home loan bank system 
unitary slhcs  such as hmn  that were in existence or had an application filed with the ots on or before may   are not subject to the new restrictions on unitary slhcs

a federal savings association may establish subsidiaries to conduct any activity the association is authorized to conduct and may establish service corporation subsidiaries for limited preapproved activities 
qualified thrift lender test 
savings associations  including the bank  must be qualified thrift lenders qtls

savings associations may qualify as qtls in other ways 
savings associations that do not qualify as qtls are subject to significant restrictions on their operations 
if the bank fails to meet qtl requirements the bank and hmn would face certain limitations  including limits on hmn s ability to control non financial firms 
as of december   the bank met the qtl test 
ots assessments 
hola authorizes the ots to charge assessments to recover the costs of examining savings associations  holding companies  and their affiliates 
the assessment is done semi annually 
the ots bases the assessment on three factors asset size  condition  and complexity of the institution 
the bank s and holding company s ots assessments for the year ended december   were approximately  transactions with affiliates and insiders 
banks and savings associations are subject to affiliate and insider transaction restrictions 
the restrictions prohibit or limit a savings association from extending credit to  or entering into certain transactions with affiliates  principal stockholders  directors and executive officers of the savings association and its affiliates 
the term affiliate generally includes a holding company  such as hmn  and any company under common control with the savings association 
federal law limits transactions between the bank and any one affiliate to of the bank s capital and surplus and with all affiliates in the aggregate to 
in addition  the federal law governing unitary savings and loan holding companies prohibits the bank from making any loan to any affiliate whose activity is not permitted for a subsidiary of a bank holding company 
this law also prohibits the bank from making any equity investment in any affiliate that is not its subsidiary 
the bank is currently in compliance with these requirements 
dividend restrictions 
federal law limits the ability of a depository institution  such as the bank  to pay dividends or make other capital distributions 
the bank  as a subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company  must file a notice with the ots before payment of a dividend or approval of a proposed capital distribution by its board of directors and must obtain prior approval from the ots if it fails to meet certain regulatory conditions 
the bank declared and distributed dividends to hmn of million in deposit insurance the fdic insures the deposits of the bank 
the fdic administers two separate deposit insurance funds  the bank insurance fund bif and the savings association insurance fund saif 
the bif is a deposit insurance fund for commercial banks and some state chartered savings associations 
the saif is a deposit insurance fund for most savings associations 
the bank is a member of the saif 
the fdic has established a risk based system for setting deposit insurance assessments 
under the risk based assessment system  an institution s insurance assessments vary according to the level of capital the institution holds and the degree to which it is the subject of supervisory concern 
in addition  regardless of the potential risk to the insurance fund  federal law requires the fdic to establish assessment rates that will maintain each insurance fund s ratio of reserves to insured deposits at per both funds currently exceed this reserve ratio 
during  the assessment rate for both saif and bif deposits ranged from zero to of covered deposits 
the bank qualified for the lowest rate on saif deposits and thus paid in it is possible that the 
table of contents reserve ratio will fall below and accordingly  it is possible the bank will have to pay deposit insurance assessments in or subsequent years 
in addition to deposit insurance assessments  the fdic is authorized to collect assessments against insured deposits to be paid to the financing corporation fico to service fico debt incurred in the s 
the fico assessment rate is adjusted quarterly 
in the bank paid an assessment of approximately  capital requirements the federal bank regulatory agencies  including the ots  have a risk based capital framework in place 
the regulators use a combination of risk based guidelines and leverage ratios to evaluate capital adequacy 
the following table sets forth the current regulatory requirement for capital ratios for savings associations as compared with the bank s capital ratios at december  core or tier capital to tangible core or tier total capital to adjusted capital to capital to risk risk weighted total assets assets weighted assets assets regulatory minimum the bank s actual savings associations are required to maintain a leverage ratio of or more to be considered adequately capitalized 
capital categories and prompt corrective action the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of fdicia created a statutory framework that increased the importance of meeting applicable capital requirements 
fdicia established five capital categories well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  and critically undercapitalized 
the activities in which a depository institution may engage and regulatory responsibilities of federal bank regulatory agencies vary depending upon whether an institution is well capitalized  adequately capitalized or under capitalized 
under capitalized institutions are subject to various restrictions such as limitations on dividends and growth 
a depository institution s category depends upon where its capital levels are in relation to relevant capital measures  which include a risk based capital measure and certain other factors 
the federal banking agencies including the ots adopted regulations that implement this statutory framework 
under these regulations  an institution is generally treated as well capitalized if its ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets is or more  its ratio of core capital to risk weighted assets is or more  its ratio of core capital to adjusted total assets leverage ratio is or more  and it is not subject to any federal supervisory order or directive to meet a specific capital level 
in order to be adequately capitalized  an institution must have a total risk based capital ratio of not less than  a tier risk based capital ratio of not less than  and a leverage ratio of not less than 
any institution that is neither well capitalized nor adequately capitalized will be considered undercapitalized 
the bank currently is considered well capitalized 
other regulations and examination authority the fdic has adopted regulations to protect the deposit insurance funds and depositors  including regulations governing the deposit insurance of various forms of accounts 
federal regulation of depository institutions is intended for the protection of depositors and the bif and the saif  and not for the protection of stockholders or other creditors 
in addition  federal law requires that in any liquidation or other resolution of any fdic insured depository institution  claims for administrative expenses of the receiver and for deposits in us branches 
table of contents including claims of the fdic as subrogee of the insured institution shall have priority over the claims of general unsecured creditors 
the ots may sanction any ots regulated bank that does not operate in accordance with ots regulations  policies and directives 
the fdic has additional authority to terminate insurance of accounts  after notice and hearing  upon a finding that the insured institution is or has engaged in any unsafe or unsound practice that has not been corrected  is operating in an unsafe or unsound condition  or has violated any applicable law  regulation  rule  or order of or condition imposed by the fdic

item a 
risk factors like all financial companies  the company s business and results of operations are subject to a number of risks  many of which are outside of the company s control 
in addition to the other information in this report  readers should carefully consider that the following important factors  among others  could materially impact the company s business and future results of operations 
changes in interest rates could negatively impact the company s results of operations 
the earnings of the company are primarily dependent on net interest income  which is the difference between interest earned on loans and investments  and interest paid on interest bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowings 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including government monetary and fiscal policies and domestic and international economic and political conditions 
conditions such as inflation  recession  unemployment  money supply  government borrowing and other factors beyond management s control may also affect interest rates 
if the company s interest earning assets mature  reprice or prepay more quickly than interest bearing liabilities in a given period  a decrease in market interest rates could adversely affect net interest income 
likewise  if interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice  or  in the case of deposits  are withdrawn by the accountholder  more quickly than interest earning assets in a given period  an increase in market interest rates could adversely affect net interest income 
given the company s current mix of assets and liabilities  a declining interest rate environment would negatively impact the company s results of operations 
fixed rate loans increase the company s exposure to interest rate risk in a rising rate environment because interest bearing liabilities would be subject to repricing before assets become subject to repricing 
adjustable rate loans decrease the risks to a lender associated with changes in interest rates but involve other risks 
as interest rates rise  the payment by the borrower rises to the extent permitted by the terms of the loan  and the increased payment increases the potential for default 
at the same time  for secured loans  the marketability of the underlying collateral may be adversely affected by higher interest rates 
in a declining interest rate environment  there is likely to be an increase in prepayment activity on loans as the borrowers refinance their loans at lower interest rates 
under these circumstances  the company s results of operations could be negatively impacted 
changes in interest rates also can affect the value of loans  investments and other interest rate sensitive assets including mortgage servicing rights  and the company s ability to realize gains on the sale or resolution of assets 
this type of income can vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year based on a number of different factors  including the interest rate environment 
an increase in interest rates that adversely affects the ability of borrowers to pay the principal or interest on loans may lead to an increase in non performing assets and increased loan loss reserve requirements that could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 

table of contents changes in interest rates or prepayment speeds could negatively impact the value of capitalized mortgage servicing rights 
the capitalization  amortization and impairment of mortgage servicing rights are subject to significant estimates 
these estimates are based upon loan types  note rates and prepayment speed assumptions 
changes in interest rates or prepayment speeds may have a material effect on the net carrying value of mortgage servicing rights 
in a declining interest rate environment  prepayment speed assumptions will increase and result in an acceleration in the amortization of the mortgage servicing rights as the assumed underlying portfolio declines and also may result in impairment as the value of the mortgage servicing rights declines 
regional economic changes in the company s markets could adversely impact results from operations 
like all banks  the company is subject to the effects of any economic downturn  and in particular a significant decline in home values or reduced commercial development in the company s markets could have a negative effect on results of operations 
the company s success depends primarily on the general economic conditions in the counties in which the company conducts business  and in the southern minnesota and northern iowa area in general 
unlike larger banks that are more geographically diversified  the company provides banking and financial services to customers primarily in the southern minnesota counties of fillmore  freeborn  houston  mower  olmsted and winona and portions of steele  dodge  goodhue and wabasha counties  as well as marshall and tama counties in iowa 
the local economic conditions in these market areas have a significant impact on the company s ability to originate loans  the ability of the borrowers to repay these loans and the value of the collateral securing these loans 
a significant decline in the general economic conditions caused by inflation  recession  unemployment or other factors beyond the company s control would affect these local economic conditions and could adversely affect the company s financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  because the company has a significant amount of commercial real estate loans  decreases in tenant occupancy may also have a negative effect on the ability of many of the company s borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans  which would have an adverse impact on the company s earnings 
a significant decline in home values would likely lead to increased delinquencies and defaults in both the consumer home equity loan and residential real estate loan portfolios and result in increased losses in these portfolios 
new or revised tax  accounting and other laws  regulations  rules and standards could significantly impact strategic initiatives  results of operations and financial condition 
the financial services industry is highly regulated and laws and regulations may sometimes impose significant limitations on operations 
these limitations  and sources of potential liability for the violation of such laws and regulations  are described in item of part i of this report under the heading business regulation and supervision 
these regulations  along with the currently existing tax and accounting laws  regulations  rules and standards  control the methods by which financial institutions conduct business  implement strategic initiatives  as well as past  present  and contemplated tax planning  and govern financial disclosures 
these laws  regulations  rules  and standards are constantly evolving and may change significantly over time 
the nature  extent  and timing of the adoption of significant new laws  changes in existing laws  or repeal of existing laws may have a material impact on the company s results of operations and financial condition  the effects of which are impossible to predict at this time 
the extended disruption of vital infrastructure could negatively impact the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the company s operations depend upon  among other things  its technological and physical infrastructure  including its equipment and facilities 
extended disruption of its vital infrastructure by fire  power loss  natural disaster  telecommunications failure  computer hacking and viruses  terrorist activity or the domestic and foreign 
table of contents response to such activity  or other events outside of the company s control  could have a material adverse impact either on the financial services industry as a whole  or on the company s business  results of operations  and financial condition 
strong competition within the company s market area may limit profitability 
the company faces significant competition both in attracting deposits and in the origination of loans  as described under the heading business competition 
mortgage bankers  commercial banks  credit unions and other savings institutions  which have offices in the bank s market area have historically provided most of the company s competition for deposits  however  the company also competes with financial institutions that operate through internet banking operations throughout the continental united states 
in addition  and particularly in times of high interest rates  the company faces additional and significant competition for funds from money market and mutual funds  securities firms  commercial banks  credit unions and other savings institutions located in the same communities and those that operate through internet banking operations throughout the continental united states 
many competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than the company 
moreover  the company may face increased competition in the origination of loans if competing thrift institutions convert to stock form  because such converting thrifts would likely seek to invest their new capital into loans 
finally  credit unions do not pay federal or state income taxes and are subject to fewer regulatory constraints than savings banks and as a result  they may enjoy a competitive advantage over the company 
the bank competes for loans principally on the basis of the interest rates and loan fees it charges  the types of loans it originates and the quality of services it provides to borrowers 
this advantage places significant competitive pressure on the prices of loans and deposits 
loss of large checking and money market deposit customers could increase cost of funds and have a negative effect on results of operations 
the company has a number of large deposit customers that maintain balances in checking and money market accounts at the bank 
the ability to attract these types of deposits has a positive effect on the company s net interest margin as they provide a relatively low cost of funds to the company compared to certificates of deposits or advances 
if these depositors were to withdraw these funds and the bank were not able to replace them with similar types of deposits  the banks cost of funds would increase and the company s results of operation would be negatively impacted 
this report  other reports filed by the company with the securities and exchange commission  and the company s proxy statement may contain forward looking statements that deal with future results  plans or performance 
in addition  the company s management may make such statements orally to the media  or to securities analysts  investors or others 
forward looking statements deal with matters that do not relate strictly to historical facts 
words such as anticipate  believe  expect  intend  would  could and similar expressions  as they relate to us  are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
the company s future results may differ materially from historical performance and forward looking statements about the company s expected financial results or other plans are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties 
these include but are not limited to possible legislative changes and adverse economic  business and competitive developments such as shrinking interest margins  deposit outflows  reduced demand for financial services and loan products  changes in accounting policies and guidelines  or monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government  changes in credit and other risks posed by the company s loan and investment portfolios  changes in loan repayment and prepayment patterns  changes in loan terms and conditions  technological  computer related or operational difficulties  adverse changes in securities markets  results of litigation or other significant uncertainties
