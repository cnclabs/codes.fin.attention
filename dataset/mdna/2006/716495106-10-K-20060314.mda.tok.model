item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
regulations domestic exploration for  and production and sale of  oil and gas are extensively regulated at both the federal and state levels 
legislation affecting the oil and gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion  frequently increasing the regulatory burden 
also  numerous departments and agencies  both federal and state  are authorized by statute to issue  and have issued  rules and regulations binding on the oil and gas industry that often are costly to comply with and that carry substantial penalties for failure to comply 
in addition  production operations are affected by changing tax and other laws relating to the petroleum industry  constantly changing administrative regulations and possible interruptions or termination by government authorities 
state regulatory authorities have established rules and regulations requiring permits for drilling operations  drilling bonds and reports concerning operations 
most states in which we operate also have statutes and regulations governing a number of environmental and conservation matters  including the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties and establishment of maximum rates of production from oil and gas wells 
many states also restrict production to the market demand for oil and gas 
such statutes and regulations may limit the rate at which oil and gas could otherwise be produced from our properties 

table of contents we are subject to extensive and evolving environmental laws and regulations 
these regulations are administered by the united states environmental protection agency and various other federal  state  and local environmental  zoning  health and safety agencies  many of which periodically examine our operations to monitor compliance with such laws and regulations 
these regulations govern the release of waste materials into the environment  or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment  human  animal and plant health  and affect our operations and costs 
in recent years  environmental regulations have taken a cradle to grave approach to waste management  regulating and creating liabilities for the waste at its inception to final disposition 
our oil and gas exploration  development and production operations are subject to numerous environmental programs  some of which include solid and hazardous waste management  water protection  air emission controls and situs controls affecting wetlands  coastal operations and antiquities 
environmental programs typically regulate the permitting  construction and operations of a facility 
many factors  including public perception  can materially impact the ability to secure an environmental construction or operation permit 
once operational  enforcement measures can include significant civil penalties for regulatory violations regardless of intent 
under appropriate circumstances  an administrative agency can request a cease and desist order to terminate operations 
new programs and changes in existing programs are anticipated  some of which include natural occurring radioactive materials  oil and gas exploration and production waste management and underground injection of waste materials 
each state in which we operate has laws and regulations governing solid waste disposal  water and air pollution 
many states also have regulations governing oil and gas exploration  development and production operations 
we are also subject to federal and state hazard communications and community right to know statutes and regulations 
these regulations govern record keeping and reporting of the use and release of hazardous substances 
we believe we are in compliance with these requirements in all material respects 
we may be required in the future to make substantial outlays to comply with environmental laws and regulations 
the additional changes in operating procedures and expenditures required to comply with future laws dealing with the protection of the environment cannot be predicted 
employees as of december   we had full time employees 
we hire independent contractors on an as needed basis 
we have no collective bargaining agreements with our employees 
we believe that our employee relationships are satisfactory

table of contents item a 
risk factors oil and natural gas prices are volatile  and low prices could have a material adverse impact on our business 
our revenues  profitability and future growth and the carrying value of our properties depend substantially on prevailing oil and gas prices 
prices also affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow and raise additional capital 
the amount we will be able to borrow under our senior revolving credit facility will be subject to periodic redetermination based in part on changing expectations of future prices 
lower prices may also reduce the amount of oil and gas that we can economically produce and have an adverse effect on the value of our properties 
prices for oil and gas have increased significantly and been more volatile over the past twelve months 
historically  the markets for oil and gas have been volatile  and they are likely to continue to be volatile in the future 
among the factors that can cause volatility are the domestic and foreign supply of oil and gas  the ability of members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries  or opec  and other producing countries to agree upon and maintain oil prices and production levels  political instability  armed conflict or terrorist attacks  whether or not in oil or gas producing regions  the level of consumer product demand  the growth of consumer product demand in emerging markets  such as china  labor unrest in oil and gas producing regions  weather conditions  including hurricanes  the price and availability of alternative fuels  the price of foreign imports  worldwide economic conditions  and the availability of liquid natural gas imports 
these external factors and the volatile nature of the energy markets make it difficult to estimate future prices of oil and gas 
in addition  the borrowing base limitation under our senior revolving credit facility is determined on a semi annual basis at the discretion of our banks and is based  in part  on oil and gas prices 
if the banks set our borrowing base at an amount below the aggregate principal amount of our debt outstanding under that facility  we could be required to repay a portion of our bank debt 
we may not have sufficient funds to make such repayments  which could result in a default under the terms of the loan agreement and an acceleration of the loan 
assets we acquire may prove to be worth less than we paid because of uncertainties in evaluating recoverable reserves and potential liabilities 
our recent growth is due significantly to acquisitions of exploration and production companies  producing properties and undeveloped leaseholds 
we expect acquisitions will also contribute to our future growth 
successful acquisitions require an assessment of a number of factors  including estimates of recoverable reserves  exploration potential  future oil and gas prices  operating and capital costs and potential environmental and other liabilities 
such assessments are inexact and their accuracy is inherently uncertain 
in connection with our assessments  we perform a review of the acquired properties which we believe is generally consistent with industry practices 
however  such a review will not reveal all existing or potential problems 
in addition  our review may not permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and capabilities 
we do not inspect every well 
even when we inspect a well  we do not always discover structural  subsurface and environmental problems that may exist or arise 
we are generally not entitled to contractual indemnification for preclosing liabilities  including environmental liabilities 
normally  we acquire interests in properties on an as is basis with limited remedies for breaches of representations and warranties 

table of contents as a result of these factors  we may not be able to acquire oil and gas properties that contain economically recoverable reserves or be able to complete such acquisitions on acceptable terms 
estimates of oil and gas reserves are uncertain and any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates will materially affect the quantities and the value of our reserves 
this report on form k contains estimates of our proved oil and gas reserves 
these estimates are based upon various assumptions  including assumptions required by the sec relating to oil and gas prices  drilling and operating expenses  capital expenditures  taxes and availability of funds 
the process of estimating oil and gas reserves is complex 
this process requires significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data for each reservoir 
actual future production  oil and gas prices  revenues  taxes  development expenditures  operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves will vary from those estimated 
any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and the value of our reserves 
our properties may also be susceptible to hydrocarbon drainage from production by other operators on adjacent properties 
in addition  we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history  results of exploration and development  prevailing oil and gas prices and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
recovery of undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations 
the reserve data assumes that we will make significant capital expenditures to develop our reserves 
although we have prepared estimates of these oil and gas reserves and the costs associated with development of these reserves in accordance with sec regulations  we cannot assure you that the estimated costs or estimated reserves are accurate  that development will occur as scheduled or that the actual results will be as estimated 
we intend to fund our development  acquisition and exploration activities in part through additional debt financing 
a higher level of debt could negatively impact our financial condition  results of operations and business prospects 
as of december   we had approximately million of long term debt  including million of long term debt that is required to be repaid in the next months 
as of december   the borrowing base under our senior revolving credit facility was million  however  as of january   it had increased to million  due to the north louisiana acquisitions in early if we incur additional debt in order to fund our development  acquisition and exploration activities or for other purposes  our level of debt  and the covenants contained in the agreements governing our debt  could have important consequences  including the following a portion of our cash flow from operations is used to pay interest on borrowings  the covenants contained in the agreements governing our debt limit  our ability to borrow additional funds  pay dividends  dispose of assets or issue shares of preferred stock and otherwise may affect our flexibility in planning for  and reacting to  changes in business conditions  a high level of debt may impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  general corporate or other purposes  a leveraged financial position would make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and could limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures  and any debt that we incur under our revolving credit facility will be at variable rates which make us vulnerable to increases in interest rates 
in addition  in connection with the mission merger  we assumed mission s senior notes in the aggregate principal amount of million 
the notes contain covenants that  subject to certain exceptions and qualifications  limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur and guarantee additional indebtedness  issue certain types of equity securities  transfer or sell assets  or pay dividends 
additionally  transactions with affiliates  selling stock of a subsidiary  merging or consolidating are subject to qualifications 

table of contents our exploration and development drilling efforts and the operation of our wells may not be profitable or achieve our targeted returns 
we require significant amounts of undeveloped leasehold acreage in order to further our development efforts 
exploration  development  drilling and production activities are subject to many risks  including the risk that commercially productive reservoirs will not be discovered 
we invest in property  including undeveloped leasehold acreage  which we believe will result in projects that will add value over time 
however  we cannot guarantee that all of our prospects will result in viable projects or that we will not abandon our initial investments 
additionally  we cannot guarantee that the leasehold acreage we acquire will be profitably developed  that new wells drilled by us will be productive or that we will recover all or any portion of our investment in such leasehold acreage or wells 
drilling for oil and gas may involve unprofitable efforts  not only from dry wells but also from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient net reserves to return a profit after deducting operating and other costs 
in addition  wells that are profitable may not achieve our targeted rate of return 
our ability to achieve our target results are dependent upon the current and future market prices for oil and gas  costs associated with producing oil and gas and our ability to add reserves at an acceptable cost 
we rely to a significant extent on d seismic data and other advanced technologies in identifying leasehold acreage prospects and in conducting our exploration activities 
the d seismic data and other technologies we use do not allow us to know conclusively prior to acquisition of leasehold acreage or drilling a well whether oil or gas is present or may be produced economically 
the use of d seismic data and other technologies also requires greater pre drilling expenditures than traditional drilling strategies 
in addition  we may not be successful in implementing our business strategy of controlling and reducing our drilling and production costs in order to improve our overall return 
the cost of drilling  completing and operating a well is often uncertain and cost factors can adversely affect the economics of a project 
we cannot predict the cost of drilling  and we may be forced to limit  delay or cancel drilling operations as a result of a variety of factors  including unexpected drilling conditions  pressure or irregularities in formations  equipment failures or accidents  adverse weather conditions  including hurricanes  compliance with governmental requirements  and shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs and the delivery of equipment 
our ability to finance our business activities will require us to generate substantial cash flow 
our business activities require substantial capital 
we intend to finance our capital expenditures in the future through cash flow from operations  the incurrence of additional indebtedness and or the issuance of additional equity securities 
we cannot be sure that our business will continue to generate cash flow at or above current levels 
future cash flows and the availability of financing will be subject to a number of variables  such as the level of production from existing wells  prices of oil and gas  our results in locating and producing new reserves  the success and timing of development of proved undeveloped reserves  and general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors beyond our control 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt  we may have to obtain additional financing through the issuance of debt and or equity 
we cannot be sure that any additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms 
issuing equity securities to satisfy our financing requirements could cause substantial dilution to our existing stockholders 
the level of our debt financing could also materially affect our operations 

table of contents if our revenues were to decrease due to lower oil and gas prices  decreased production or other reasons  and if we could not obtain capital through our senior revolving credit facility or otherwise  our ability to execute our development and acquisition plans  replace our reserves or maintain production levels could be greatly limited 
we depend substantially on the continued presence of key personnel for critical management decisions and industry contacts 
our future performance will be substantially dependent on retaining key members of our management 
the loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  financial condition and cash flows 
we currently do not have employment agreements with any of our officers 
the unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs  equipment  supplies  personnel and oil field services could adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans on a timely basis and within our budget 
our industry is cyclical and  from time to time  there is a shortage of drilling rigs  equipment  supplies or qualified personnel 
during these periods  the costs and delivery times of rigs  equipment and supplies are substantially greater 
in addition  the demand for  and wage rates of  qualified drilling rig crews rise as the number of active rigs in service increases 
as a result of increasing levels of exploration and production in response to strong prices of oil and natural gas  the demand for oilfield services has risen  and the costs of these services are increasing  while the quality of these services may suffer 
if the unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs  equipment  supplies or qualified personnel were particularly severe in texas and louisiana  we could be materially and adversely affected because our operations and properties are concentrated in those areas 
the marketability of our oil and gas production depends on services and facilities that we typically do not own or control 
the failure or inaccessibility of any such services or facilities could result in a curtailment of production and revenues 
the marketability of our production depends in part upon the availability  proximity and capacity of gathering systems  pipelines and processing facilities 
pursuant to interruptible or short term transportation agreements  we generally deliver gas through gathering systems and pipelines that we do not own 
under the interruptible transportation agreements  the transportation of our gas may be interrupted due to capacity constraints on the applicable system  for maintenance or repair of the system  or for other reasons as dictated by the particular agreements 
if any of the pipelines or other facilities become unavailable  we would be required to find a suitable alternative to transport and process the gas  which could increase our costs and reduce the revenues we might obtain from the sale of the gas 
for example  hurricane rita disrupted the operations of gas pipelines and processing plants and required the evacuation of personnel required to oversee some of our facilities in the gulf coast and gulf of mexico areas 
we depend on the skill  ability and decisions of third party operators to a significant extent 
the success of the drilling  development and production of the oil and gas properties in which we have or expect to have a non operating working interest is substantially dependent upon the decisions of such third party operators and their diligence to comply with various laws  rules and regulations affecting such properties 
the failure of any third party operator to make decisions  perform their services  discharge their obligations  deal with regulatory agencies  and comply with laws  rules and regulations  including environmental laws and regulations in a proper manner with respect to properties in which we have an interest could result in material adverse consequences to our interest in such properties  including substantial penalties and compliance costs 
such adverse consequences could result in substantial liabilities to us or reduce the value of our properties  which could negatively affect our results of operations 
our business is highly competitive 
the oil and gas industry is highly competitive in many respects  including identification of attractive oil and gas properties for acquisition  drilling and development  securing financing for such activities and obtaining the necessary equipment and personnel to conduct such operations and activities 
in seeking suitable opportunities  we compete with a number of other companies  including large oil and gas companies and other independent operators with greater financial resources  larger numbers of personnel and facilities  and  in some cases  with more expertise 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively with these entities 

table of contents hedging transactions may limit our potential gains 
in order to manage our exposure to price risks in the marketing of our oil and gas production  from time to time we enter into oil and gas price hedging arrangements with respect to a portion of our expected production 
while intended to reduce the effects of volatile oil and gas prices  such transactions may limit our potential gains and increase our potential losses if oil and gas prices were to rise substantially over the price established by the hedge 
in addition  such transactions may expose us to the risk of loss in certain circumstances  including instances in which our production is less than expected  there is a widening of price differentials between delivery points for our production and the delivery point assumed in the hedge arrangement  or the counterparties to our hedging agreements fail to perform under the contracts 
our oil and gas activities are subject to various risks which are beyond our control 
our operations are subject to many risks and hazards incident to exploring and drilling for  producing  transporting  marketing and selling oil and gas 
although we may take precautionary measures  many of these risks and hazards are beyond our control and unavoidable under the circumstances 
many of these risks or hazards could materially and adversely affect our revenues and expenses  the ability of certain of our wells to produce oil and gas in commercial quantities  the rate of production and the economics of the development of  and our investment in the prospects in which we have or will acquire an interest 
any of these risks and hazards could materially and adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
such risks and hazards include human error  accidents  labor force and other factors beyond our control that may cause personal injuries or death to persons and destruction or damage to equipment and facilities  blowouts  fires  hurricanes  pollution and equipment failures that may result in damage to or destruction of wells  producing formations  production facilities and equipment  unavailability of materials and equipment  engineering and construction delays  unanticipated transportation costs and delays  unfavorable weather conditions  hazards resulting from unusual or unexpected geological or environmental conditions  environmental regulations and requirements  accidental leakage of toxic or hazardous materials  such as petroleum liquids or drilling fluids  into the environment  changes in laws and regulations  including laws and regulations applicable to oil and gas activities or markets for the oil and gas produced  fluctuations in supply and demand for oil and gas causing variations of the prices we receive for our oil and gas production  and the internal and political decisions of opec and oil and natural gas producing nations and their impact upon oil and gas prices 
as a result of these risks  expenditures  quantities and rates of production  revenues and cash operating costs may be materially adversely affected and may differ materially from those anticipated by us 

table of contents governmental and environmental regulations could adversely affect our business 
our business is subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations on taxation  the exploration for and development  production and marketing of oil and gas and safety matters 
many laws and regulations require drilling permits and govern the spacing of wells  rates of production  prevention of waste  unitization and pooling of properties and other matters 
these laws and regulations have increased the costs of planning  designing  drilling  installing  operating and abandoning our oil and gas wells and other facilities 
in addition  these laws and regulations  and any others that are passed by the jurisdictions where we have production  could limit the total number of wells drilled or the allowable production from successful wells  which could limit our revenues 
our operations are also subject to complex environmental laws and regulations adopted by the various jurisdictions in which we have or expect to have oil and gas operations 
we could incur liability to governments or third parties for any unlawful discharge of oil  gas or other pollutants into the air  soil or water  including responsibility for remedial costs 
we could potentially discharge these materials into the environment in any of the following ways from a well or drilling equipment at a drill site  from gathering systems  pipelines  transportation facilities and storage tanks  damage to oil and gas wells resulting from accidents during normal operations  and blowouts  hurricanes  cratering and explosions 
because the requirements imposed by laws and regulations are frequently changed  we cannot assure you that laws and regulations enacted in the future  including changes to existing laws and regulations  will not adversely affect our business 
in addition  because we acquire interests in properties that have been operated in the past by others  we may be liable for environmental damage caused by the former operators 
we cannot be certain that the insurance coverage maintained by us will be adequate to cover all losses that may be sustained in connection with all oil and gas activities 
we maintain general and excess liability policies  which we consider to be reasonable and consistent with industry standards 
these policies generally cover personal injury  bodily injury  third party property damage  medical expenses  legal defense costs  pollution in some cases  well blowouts in some cases  and workers compensation 
there can be no assurance that this insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover every claim made against us in the future 
a loss in connection with our oil and natural gas properties could have a materially adverse effect on our financial position and results of operation to the extent that the insurance coverage provided under our policies cover only a portion of any such loss 

table of contents title to the properties in which we have an interest may be impaired by title defects 
we generally obtain title opinions on significant properties that we drill or acquire 
however  there is no assurance that we will not suffer a monetary loss from title defects or failure 
generally  under the terms of the operating agreements affecting our properties  any monetary loss is to be borne by all parties to any such agreement in proportion to their interests in such property 
if there are any title defects or defects in assignment of leasehold rights in properties in which we hold an interest  we will suffer a financial loss

our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this form k contain additional information that should be referred to when reviewing this material 
statements in this discussion may be forward looking 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties  including those discussed below  which could cause actual results to differ from those expressed 
overview we are a independent oil and gas company engaged in the acquisition  development  production and exploration of oil and gas properties located in north america 
our properties are concentrated in the permian basin  east texas  north louisiana  gulf coast  south texas  anadarko and arkoma regions 
we have increased our proved reserves and production principally through acquisitions in conjunction with an active drilling program 
since november  we have acquired approximately bcfe of proved reserves for approximately billion  including the recently completed north louisiana acquisitions 
during  excluding acquisitions  we replaced approximately of our production organically 
organic reserve additions were primarily driven by d seismic supported exploratory drilling in our core regions of south texas and the gulf coast  as well as continuing evaluation of several fields in the permian basin 
fields that contributed significantly to the growth were the lions goliad county  texas  waddell ranch crane county  texas  provident city colorado county  texas  la reforma starr county  texas  and gueydan vermilion parish  louisiana 
during  we participated in the drilling of wells  of which nine were dry holes  for a success rate of 
we focus on maintaining a balanced  geographically diverse portfolio of long lived  lower risk reserves along with shorter lived  higher margin reserves 
we believe that this balanced reserve mix provides a diversified cash flow foundation to fund our development and exploration drilling program 
our financial results depend upon many factors  particularly the price of oil and gas and our ability to market our production 
commodity prices are affected by changes in market demands  which are impacted by overall economic activity  weather  pipeline capacity constraints  inventory storage levels  basis differentials and other factors 
as a result  we cannot accurately predict future oil and gas prices  and therefore  we cannot determine what effect increases or decreases will have on our capital program  production volumes and future revenues 
in addition to production volumes and commodity prices  finding and developing sufficient amounts of oil and gas reserves at economical costs are critical to our long term success 
capital resources and liquidity our primary sources of cash in were from operating and financing activities 
proceeds from the issuance of long term debt and cash received from operations as well as divestitures in were offset by cash used in investing activities to complete the acquisitions of mission and proton 
operating cash flow fluctuations were substantially driven by commodity prices and changes in our production volumes 
prices for oil and gas have historically been subject to seasonal influences characterized by peak demand and higher prices in the winter heating season  however  the impact of other risks and uncertainties have influenced prices throughout the recent years 
working capital was substantially influenced by these variables 
fluctuation in cash flow may result in an increase or decrease in our capital and exploration expenditures 
see results of operations for a review of the impact of prices and volumes on sales 
cash flows provided by operating activities were primarily used to fund exploration and development expenditures 
see below for additional discussion and analysis of cash flow 

table of contents year ended december  in thousands cash flows provided by operating activities cash flows used in investing activities cash flows provided by used in financing activities net increase in cash and cash equivalents operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities in increased million from this increase was primarily due to higher commodity prices and an increase in sales volumes in conjunction with the acquisitions discussed above 
average realized prices increased from per mcfe in to per mcfe in production volumes increased  mmcfe from  mmcfe in to  mmcfe in we expect production to increase  but we are unable to predict future commodity prices 
as a result  we cannot provide any assurance about future levels of net cash provided by operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities in increased million from this increase was primarily due to a increase in the average equivalent price per mcfe 
investing activities 
the primary driver of cash used in investing activities was capital spending  inclusive of acquisitions 
we establish the budget for these amounts based on our estimate of future commodity prices 
due to the volatility of commodity prices  our budget may be periodically adjusted during any given year 
cash used in investing activities in decreased million from million in to million in primarily due to the nature of financing of our wynn crosby acquisition as compared to our mission acquisition 
in  we spent million to acquire wynn crosby for a purchase price of approximately million after closing adjustments 
the transaction was funded with proceeds from a million private equity placement  million in borrowings from our commercial bank group and cash 
in  we acquired mission for consideration consisting of of company common stock and cash 
in this transaction we paid approximately million  net of cash acquired 
we also assumed million of mission s long term debt 
also in  we acquired proton for approximately million  net of cash acquired 
the acquisitions were offset by the receipt of million in  primarily for the sale of certain royalty properties for million 
the overall net decrease in cash used in investing activities was offset by an increase in overall capital spending of approximately million 
in  we drilled gross wells compared to in cash flows used in investing activities increased million from to million in primarily due to the acquisition activity discussed above 
on january   the company completed the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding common stock of winwell resources  inc winwell pursuant to a stock purchase agreement with winwell and all of its shareholders made and entered into as of december  the stock purchase transaction 
the aggregate consideration paid in the stock purchase transaction was approximately million in cash after certain closing adjustments 
also on january   the company completed its acquisition of assets pursuant to an asset purchase agreement with redley  made and entered into as of december   as amended  the asset purchase transaction 
the aggregate consideration paid in the asset purchase transaction was approximately million in cash after certain closing adjustments 
the company deposited million in earnest money under the terms of the stock purchase transaction  and million under the terms of the asset purchase transaction 
the million deposit was included in other non current assets at december  the deposit and any interest earned thereon was applied to the overall purchase price 
we have established a capital budget of million for to be funded primarily from cash flows from operations 
we establish the budget for these amounts based on our current estimate of future commodity prices 
due to the volatility of commodity prices our budget may be periodically adjusted 

table of contents financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities in was million compared to million in at december   we had million of debt outstanding under our senior revolving credit facility  which provides for a borrowing base of million 
it is subject to adjustment on the basis of the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves as determined by the banks petroleum engineer 
we strive to manage our debt at a level below the available credit line in order to maintain excess borrowing capacity 
management believes that we have the ability to finance through new debt or equity offerings  if necessary  our capital requirements  including potential acquisitions
