item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
noble energy is an independent energy company engaged  directly or through its subsidiaries  in the exploration  development  production and marketing of crude oil and natural gas 
the company has exploration  exploitation and production operations domestically and internationally 
noble energy operates throughout major basins in the united states including colorado s wattenberg field  the mid continent region of western oklahoma and the texas panhandle  the san juan basin in new mexico  the gulf coast and the gulf of mexico 
noble energy also operates internationally  in equatorial guinea  the mediterranean sea  ecuador  the north sea  china  argentina and suriname 
the company s accompanying consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto  contain detailed information that should be referred to in conjunction with the following discussion 
executive overview noble energy is a worldwide producer of crude oil and natural gas 
the company s strategy is to achieve growth in earnings and cash flow through the development of a high quality portfolio of producing assets that is balanced between domestic and international projects 
the patina merger allowed noble energy to achieve a strategic objective of enhancing its us asset portfolio and has resulted in a company with assets and capabilities that include growing us basins  coupled with a significant portfolio of international properties 
after the patina merger noble energy has approximately greater production than with a reserve base that is balanced between domestic and foreign sources 
in addition  the company has been reducing its investment in the gulf of mexico s conventional shallow shelf and shifting its domestic offshore exploration focus to gulf of mexico deepwater areas 
noble energy is now a larger  more diversified company with greater opportunities for both domestic and international growth through high upside exploration drilling as well as lower risk exploitation projects 
the company had a successful year  both financially and operationally  in financial highlights included the following successful completion of the patina merger  record net income of million  a increase over  diluted earnings per share of  a increase over  cash flow provided by operating activities of billion  a increase over  and entry into a new billion five year revolving credit facility 
significant operational highlights included the following a increase in daily equivalent production over  including a domestic increase and a international increase  increases of in the average realized crude oil price and in the average realized natural gas price over  increases in average realized methanol  lpg and ecuador power prices  first production from the deepwater gulf of mexico swordfish development  belinda discovery on block o in equatorial guinea  completion and start up of phase b liquids expansion project in equatorial guinea  sanctioning of the dumbarton development in the north sea  sanctioning of the lorien development in the deepwater gulf of mexico  deepwater gulf of mexico exploration agreement with samson offshore company signed in december  and impact of hurricanes katrina and rita 
merger with patina oil gas corporation on may   noble energy completed the patina merger in a transaction accounted for as a purchase of patina by noble energy 
patina was an independent energy company engaged in the acquisition and development of crude oil and natural gas properties within the continental united states 
patina s properties and crude oil and natural gas reserves are principally located in relatively long lived fields with established production histories 
the properties are primarily concentrated in the wattenberg field of colorado s d j basin  the mid continent region of western oklahoma and the texas panhandle  and the san juan basin in new mexico 
noble energy acquired the common stock of patina for a total purchase price of approximately billion  which was comprised primarily of cash and noble energy common stock  plus liabilities assumed 
in exchange for patina s common stock and options  noble energy issued million shares of stock valued at billion  issued options valued at million  paid billion in cash to patina shareholders and assumed debt of million and deferred taxes of billion 
the consolidated operating and cash flow information includes financial results of patina after may  domestic operations domestic operations benefited from higher realized prices for crude oil and natural gas in  and a overall increase in production 
during  noble energy drilled gross domestic onshore and gross domestic offshore wells 
during  the company s north america domestic division continued to make progress on significant deepwater developments in the gulf of mexico that are expected to add substantial new production during swordfish viosca knoll block  and three subsea wells were tied back via dual flowlines to kerr mcgee s neptune spar in viosca knoll and production began fourth quarter with a production volume of approximately  boepd  net to the company working interest  lorien green canyon block a successful development well was drilled in and both the discovery well and development well were completed 
installation of subsea infrastructure to tie the wells back to a nearby host is currently underway  with production expected to commence in the first half of at an initial rate of approximately  boepd  net to the company working interest  ticonderoga green canyon block a successful development well was drilled in and both the discovery well and development well were completed with a subsea tieback 
ticonderoga achieved first production on february  and has achieved peak production volumes of approximately  bopd and  mcfpd  net to noble energy s working interest 
impact of gulf coast hurricanes in august hurricane katrina moved through the gulf of mexico and resulted in the loss of the main pass d platform 
in september hurricane rita struck the gulf coast 
initial inspection of the company s operated platforms indicated there was no additional major damage due to hurricane rita  although damage to third party processing and pipeline facilities slowed reinstatement of production from the company s gulf of mexico assets 
in addition  the hurricanes delayed efforts to restore sales of production from undamaged platforms at main pass that were shut in by hurricane ivan in the company estimates that production was reduced by approximately  boepd due to the effects of the hurricanes 
the loss of production is not covered by business interruption insurance 
international operations during  international production volumes increased  compared to  primarily from increased production in equatorial guinea 
international operations also benefited from higher realized commodity prices 
in equatorial guinea  the phase b liquids expansion project  which included increasing processing capacity  storage and offloading facilities at the existing lpg plant  has been completed and has increased lpg production by  bbls per day and condensate production by bbls per day  net to noble energy  during in october  noble energy announced successful results from its offshore belinda exploration well on block o in equatorial guinea 
the company is currently reviewing options for a multi well exploration and appraisal program  which is expected to begin in noble energy is the technical operator of block o with a participating interest 
outlook in february  noble energy announced that it had agreed to purchase the common stock of us exploration  a privately held corporation located in billings  montana  for million 
subject to customary conditions  the transaction is scheduled to close on or before march  prior to closing  us exploration will retire all company debt  terminate its commodity hedges and make all severance payments 
capital spending on the us exploration properties will be focused on accelerating production and reserve development 
in  capital expenditures are expected to be approximately million 
noble energy has executed hedges on its own production volumes from march through that are equivalent to just over of us exploration s expected volumes 
the hedges are in the form of collars 
the average floors on the natural gas hedges and crude oil hedges are per mmbtu and per bbl 
the average ceilings on the natural gas hedges and crude oil hedges are mmbtu and per bbl 
the natural gas hedges are priced at the cig index and thereby include basis differentials to henry hub 
the company expects crude oil and natural gas production from continuing operations to increase in compared to the expected year over year increase in production is impacted by several factors a full year of production including assets acquired in the patina merger  the contribution of the swordfish deepwater gulf of mexico development  which commenced production fourth quarter  the start up of production from the ticonderoga and lorien deepwater gulf of mexico developments  which are expected to begin producing in the first and second quarters of  respectively  and a full year of production from the phase b liquids expansion project in equatorial guinea 
noble energy s production profile will be impacted by several factors  including the timing and amount of initial production from ticonderoga and lorien  seasonal variations in rainfall in ecuador that affect the company s natural gas to power project  potential weather related shut ins in the us gulf of mexico and gulf coast areas  and downtime associated with plant maintenance or turnaround 
budget the company has budgeted capital expenditures of billion for approximately of the capital budget has been allocated to exploration opportunities and has been allocated to production  development and other projects 
domestic spending is budgeted for million of the capital budget  international expenditures are budgeted for million and corporate expenditures are budgeted for million 
the budget does not include the impact of possible asset purchases  including the previously announced pending purchase of us exploration as well as anticipated development costs associated with us exploration 
the company expects that its capital budget will be funded primarily from cash flows from operations 
the company will evaluate its level of capital spending throughout the year based upon drilling results  commodity prices  cash flows from operations and property acquisitions 
accounting for share based payments in december  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
this statement is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related implementation guidance 
sfas no 
r requires companies to recognize in the income statement the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation issued to employees and is effective for interim or annual periods beginning on or after january  the company will adopt sfas no 
r as of january   using the modified prospective transition method 
under the modified prospective transition method  awards that are granted  modified or settled after the date of adoption will be measured in accordance with sfas no 
r 
unvested equity classified awards that were granted prior to january  will be accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 except that the amounts will be expensed in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
upon adoption of sfas no 
r  the balance of deferred compensation relating to restricted stock in the company s shareholders equity account will be reversed against capital in excess of par value in accordance with the transition requirements 
due to the complexity of developing a model to adequately value the company s share based compensation awards  the company has not yet quantified the impact of the new statement  but it is expected to increase compensation expense in critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management of the company to make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period 
when alternatives exist among various accounting methods  the choice of accounting method can have a significant impact on reported amounts 
the following is a discussion of the company s accounting policies  estimates and judgments which management believes are most significant in its application of generally accepted accounting principles used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
purchase price allocation as a result of the patina merger  in may the company acquired the assets and assumed the liabilities of patina in a transaction accounted for as a purchase of patina by the company 
in connection with a purchase business combination  the acquiring company must allocate the cost of the acquisition to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on fair values as of the acquisition date 
deferred taxes must be recorded for any differences between the assigned values and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
any excess of purchase price over amounts assigned to assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill 
the amount of goodwill recorded in any particular business combination can vary significantly depending upon the value attributed to assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
in estimating the fair values of patina s assets and liabilities the company made various assumptions 
the most significant assumptions related to the estimated fair values assigned to proved and unproved crude oil and natural gas properties 
to estimate the fair values of these properties  the company prepared estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves 
the company estimated future prices to apply to the estimated reserve quantities acquired  and estimated future operating and development costs  to arrive at estimates of future net revenues 
for estimated proved reserves  the future net revenues were discounted using a market based weighted average cost of capital rate determined appropriate at the time of the merger 
the market based weighted average cost of capital rate was subjected to additional project specific risking factors 
to compensate for the inherent risk of estimating and valuing unproved reserves  the discounted future net revenues of probable and possible reserves were reduced by additional risk weighting factors 
estimated deferred taxes were based on available information concerning the tax basis of patina s assets and liabilities and loss carryforwards at the merger date  although such estimates may change in the future as additional information becomes known 
while the estimates of fair value for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed have no effect on noble energy s cash flows  they can have an effect on the future results of operations 
generally  higher fair values assigned to crude oil and natural gas properties result in higher future depreciation  depletion and amortization expense  which results in a decrease in future net earnings 
also  a higher fair value assigned to crude oil and natural gas properties  based on higher future estimates of crude oil and natural gas prices  could increase the likelihood of an impairment in the event of lower commodity prices or higher operating costs than those originally used to determine fair value 
an impairment would have no effect on cash flows but would result in a decrease in net income for the period in which the impairment is recorded 
certain data necessary to complete the company s final purchase price allocation is not yet available  and includes  but is not limited to  final valuation of pre acquisition contingencies  final tax returns that provide the underlying tax bases of patina s assets and liabilities at may   and final appraisals of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
the company expects to complete its valuation of assets and liabilities including deferred taxes for the purpose of allocation of the total purchase price amount to assets acquired and liabilities assumed during the twelve month period following the acquisition date 
any future change in the value of net assets up until the one year period has expired will be offset by a corresponding increase or decrease in goodwill 
any change in deferred tax assets and liabilities as of the merger date may  based on information that becomes available later will be recorded as an increase or decrease in goodwill 
goodwill as of december  noble energy has million of goodwill recorded in connection with the patina merger 
the goodwill was assigned to the company s domestic reporting unit 
goodwill is not amortized to earnings but is tested  at least annually  for impairment at the reporting unit level 
the company conducted its goodwill impairment test as of december  other events and changes in circumstances may also require goodwill to be tested for impairment between annual measurement dates 
if the carrying value of goodwill is determined to be impaired  the amount of goodwill is reduced and a corresponding charge is made to earnings in the period in which the goodwill is determined to be impaired 
the impairment assessment requires management to make estimates regarding the fair value of the reporting unit to which goodwill has been assigned 
the company determines the fair value of its domestic reporting unit using a combination of the income approach and the market approach 
under the income approach  the company estimates the fair value of the reporting unit based on the present value of expected future cash flows 
under the market approach  the company estimates the fair value based on market multiples of ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  and depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a and ebit earnings before interest and taxes 
the income approach is dependent on a number of factors including estimates of forecasted revenue and operating costs  proved reserves  as well as the success of future exploration for and development of unproved reserves  appropriate discount rates and other variables 
downward revisions of estimated reserve quantities  increases in future cost estimates  divestiture of a significant component of the reporting unit  or sustained decreases in natural gas or crude oil prices could lead to an impairment of all or a portion of goodwill in future periods 
under the market approach  the company makes certain judgments about the selection of comparable companies  comparable recent company and asset transactions and transaction premiums 
although the company has based its fair value estimate on assumptions it believes to be reasonable  those assumptions are inherently unpredictable and uncertain and actual results could differ from the estimate 
in  no goodwill impairment was recognized 
reserves all of the reserve data in this form k are estimates 
the company s estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves are prepared by the company s engineers in accordance with guidelines established by the sec 
reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil and natural gas 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved crude oil and natural gas reserves 
uncertainties include the projection of future production rates and the expected timing of development expenditures 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
as a result  reserve estimates may be different from the quantities of crude oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered 
estimates of proved crude oil and natural gas reserves significantly affect the company s dd a expense 
for example  if estimates of proved reserves decline  the company s dd a rate will increase  resulting in a decrease in net income 
a decline in estimates of proved reserves could also trigger an impairment analysis to determine if the carrying amount of crude oil and natural gas properties exceeds fair value and could result in an impairment charge which would reduce earnings 
oil and gas properties the company accounts for its crude oil and natural gas properties under the successful efforts method of accounting 
the alternative method of accounting for crude oil and natural gas properties is the full cost method 
under the successful efforts method  costs to acquire mineral interests in crude oil and natural gas properties  to drill and equip exploratory wells that find proved reserves and to drill and equip development wells are capitalized 
capitalized costs of producing crude oil and natural gas properties are amortized to operations by the unit of production method based on proved developed crude oil and natural gas reserves on a property by property basis as estimated by company engineers 
application of the successful efforts method results in the expensing of certain costs including geological and geophysical costs  exploratory dry holes and delay rentals  during the periods the costs are incurred 
under the full cost method  these costs are capitalized as assets and charged to earnings in future periods as a component of dd a expense 
in addition  under the full cost method capitalized costs are accumulated in pools on a country by country basis 
dd a is computed on a country by country basis  and capitalized costs are limited on the same basis through the application of a ceiling test 
the company believes the successful efforts method is the most appropriate method to use to account for its crude oil and natural gas production activities because this method is better aligned with the company s business strategy 
if the company had used the full cost method  its financial position and results of operations could have been significantly different 
exploratory well costs in accordance with the successful efforts method of accounting  the costs associated with drilling an exploratory well may be capitalized temporarily  or suspended  pending a determination of whether commercial quantities of crude oil or natural gas have been discovered 
the company will carry the costs of an exploratory well as an asset if the well found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its capitalization as a producing well and as long as the company is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project 
for certain capital intensive deepwater gulf of mexico or international projects  it may take the company more than one year to evaluate the future potential of the exploration well and make a determination of its economic viability 
the company s ability to move forward on a project may be dependent on gaining access to transportation or processing facilities or obtaining permits and government or partner approval  the timing of which is beyond the company s control 
in such cases  exploratory well costs remain suspended as long as the company is actively pursuing access to necessary facilities and access to such permits and approvals and believes they will be obtained 
management assesses the status of its suspended exploratory well costs on a quarterly basis 
these costs may be charged to exploration expense in future periods if the company decides not to pursue additional exploratory or development activities 
at december   the balance of property  plant and equipment included million of suspended exploratory well costs  none of which had been capitalized for a period greater than one year 
the wells relating to these suspended costs continue to be evaluated by various means including additional seismic work  drilling additional wells or evaluating the potential of the exploration wells 
for more information  see note capitalized exploratory well costs 
proved oil and gas properties the company assesses proved crude oil and natural gas properties for possible impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the recorded carrying value of the properties may not be recoverable 
the company recognizes an impairment loss as a result of a triggering event and when the estimated undiscounted future cash flows from a property are less than the current net book value 
estimated future cash flows are based on management s expectations for the future and include estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves and future commodity prices and operating costs 
downward revisions in estimates of reserve quantities or expectations of falling commodity prices or rising operating costs could result in a reduction in undiscounted future cash flows and could indicate a property impairment 
the company recorded million of impairments in  primarily related to downward reserve revisions on certain domestic properties 
unproved oil and gas properties the company also performs periodic assessments of individually significant unproved crude oil and natural gas properties for impairment 
cash flows used in the impairment analysis are determined based upon management s estimates of natural gas and crude oil reserves  future commodity prices and future costs to extract the reserves 
downward revisions in estimated reserve quantities  reductions in commodity prices  or increases in estimated costs could cause a reduction in the value of an unproved property and  therefore  could also cause a reduction in the carrying amounts of the property 
if undiscounted future net cash flows are less than the carrying value of the property  indicating an impairment  the cash flows are discounted at a rate approximate to the company s cost of capital and compared to the carrying value for determining the amount of the impairment loss to record 
the estimated prices used in the cash flow analysis are determined by management based on forward price curves for the related commodities  adjusted for average historical location and quality differentials 
estimates of cash flows related to probable and possible reserves are reduced by additional risk weighting factors 
due to the volatility of natural gas and crude oil prices  these cash flow estimates are inherently imprecise 
management s assessment of the results of exploration activities  availability of funds for future activities and the current and projected political climate in areas in which the company operates also impact the amounts and timing of impairment provisions 
during  the company recorded impairments of significant unproved oil and gas properties totaling million 
asset retirement obligation the company s asset retirement obligations aro consist of estimated costs of dismantlement  removal  site reclamation and similar activities associated with its oil and gas properties 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  requires that the discounted fair value of a liability for an aro be recognized in the period in which it is incurred with the associated asset retirement cost capitalized as part of the carrying cost of the oil and gas asset 
the recognition of an aro requires that management make numerous estimates  assumptions and judgments regarding such factors as the existence of a legal obligation for an aro  estimated probabilities  amounts and timing of settlements  the credit adjusted risk free rate to be used  and inflation rates 
in periods subsequent to initial measurement of the aro  the company must recognize period to period changes in the liability resulting from the passage of time and revisions to either the timing or the amount of the original estimate of undiscounted cash flows 
increases in the aro liability due to passage of time impact net income as accretion expense 
the related capitalized cost  including revisions thereto  is charged to expense through dd a 
at december   the company s balance sheet included a liability for aro of million  including million resulting from hurricane damage 
see note asset retirement obligations 
involuntary conversions when an involuntary conversion occurs  such as the destruction of oil and gas producing assets by a hurricane  the company accrues a loss by a charge to income if the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
the company recognizes an asset relating to insurance recovery only when realization of the claim for recovery of a loss recognized in the financial statements is deemed probable 
the company does not recognize a gain a recovery of a loss not yet recognized in the financial statements or an amount recovered in excess of a loss recognized in the financial statements until the insurance reimbursement has been received 
management of the company must make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to these gain and loss accruals 
these include estimated costs of salvage  clean up  restoration  redevelopment or abandonment and estimated amounts of insurance recoveries 
the amount of an insurance recovery may be limited if total industry claims are in excess of the insurance provider s ceiling limitation per event 
a significant amount of time may be necessary for an insurance provider to review all related claims for an event and determine the company specific claim limitation on the final recovery 
in addition  the company may continue to incur costs  submit claims and receive reimbursements over a multi year period 
the estimates involved in this process can have significant effects on reported amounts of net income 
a decrease in the estimated amount of insurance recoveries will result in a decrease in the involuntary conversion gain  which will result in a decrease in net income 
an increase in estimated costs of salvage will result in an increase in the involuntary conversion loss  which will result in a decrease in net income 
unreimbursed losses will have a negative effect on the company s cash flows 
derivative instruments and hedging activities the company uses various derivative instruments to minimize the impact of commodity price fluctuations on forecasted sales of crude oil and natural gas production 
the company also uses derivative instruments in connection with its purchases and sales of third party production to lock in profits or limit exposure to commodity price risk 
in addition  the company has used derivative instruments in connection with acquisitions and certain price sensitive projects 
management exercises significant judgment in determining types of instruments to be used  production volumes to be hedged  prices at which to hedge and the counterparties and the hedging counterparties creditworthiness 
the company accounts for its derivative instruments under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended 
for derivative instruments that qualify as cash flow hedges  changes in fair value  to the extent the hedge is effective  are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income aoci until the hedged forecasted transaction is recognized in earnings 
therefore  prior to settlement of the derivative instruments  changes in the fair market value of those derivative instruments can cause significant increases or decreases in aoci 
for derivative instruments that do not qualify as cash flow hedges  changes in fair value are reported in current period net income and therefore can result in significant increases or decreases in current period net income 
all hedge ineffectiveness is recognized in the current period in net income 
ineffectiveness is the amount of gains or losses from derivative instruments which are not offset by corresponding and opposite gains or losses on the expected future transaction 
regression analysis is performed on initial assessment of the hedge and subsequently every quarter thereafter in order to determine that the hedge instrument will be or has been highly effective in offsetting gains or losses on the future transaction 
income taxes the company is subject to income and other taxes in numerous taxing jurisdictions worldwide 
for financial reporting purposes  the company provides taxes at rates applicable for the appropriate tax jurisdictions 
estimates of amounts of income tax to be recorded involve interpretation of complex tax laws  including the american jobs creation act of  assessment of the effects of foreign taxes on domestic taxes  and estimates regarding the timing and amounts of future repatriation of earnings from controlled foreign corporations 
the company s balance sheet includes deferred tax assets related to deductible temporary differences and operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits 
ultimately  realization of a deferred tax asset depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income within the future periods to absorb future deductible temporary differences  loss carryforwards or credits 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management must consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
management considers all available evidence both positive and negative in determining whether a valuation allowance is required 
such evidence includes the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment  and judgment is required in considering the relative weight of negative and positive evidence 
the company will continue to monitor facts and circumstances in its reassessment of the likelihood that operating loss carryforwards  credits and other deferred tax assets will be utilized prior to their expiration 
as a result  the company may determine that a deferred tax asset valuation allowance should be established 
any increases or decreases in a deferred tax asset valuation allowance would impact net income through offsetting changes in income tax expense 
pension plan the company sponsors a defined benefit pension plan and other postretirement benefit plans 
the actuarial determination of the projected benefit obligation and related benefit expense requires that certain assumptions be made regarding such variables as expected return on plan assets  discount rates  rates of future compensation increases  estimated future employee turnover rates and retirement dates  distribution election rates  mortality rates  retiree utilization rates for health care services and health care cost trend rates 
the selection of assumptions requires considerable judgment concerning future events and has a significant impact on the amount of the obligation recorded on the company s balance sheets and on the amount of expense included on the company s statements of operations  as well as on funding 
noble energy bases its determination of the asset return component of pension expense on a market related valuation of assets  which reduces year to year volatility 
this market related valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a five year period from the year in which they occur 
investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market related value of assets and the actual return based on the fair value of assets 
since the market related value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a five year period  the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded 
as of december   the company had cumulative asset losses of approximately million  which remain to be recognized in the calculation of the market related value of assets 
the company utilizes the services of an outside actuarial firm to assist in the calculations of the projected benefit obligation and related costs 
the company and its actuaries use historical data and forecasts to determine assumptions regarding future events 
in selecting the assumption for expected long term rate of return on assets  the company considers the average rate of earnings expected on the funds to be invested to provide for plan benefits 
this includes considering the plan s asset allocation  historical returns on these types of assets  the current economic environment and the expected returns likely to be earned over the life of the plan 
it is assumed that the long term asset mix will be consistent with the target asset allocation of equity and fixed income  with a range of plus or minus acceptable degree of variation in the plan s asset allocation 
the discount rate is determined by analyzing the interest rates implicit in current annuity contract prices and available yields on high quality fixed income securities 
by definition  discount rates reflect rates at which pension benefits could be effectively settled 
a decrease in the expected return on plan assets assumption would have increased benefit expense by million 
the expected return assumption for is  and the assumed discount rate for is 
liquidity and capital resources overview the company s primary cash needs are to fund capital expenditures related to the acquisition  exploration and development of crude oil and natural gas properties  to repay outstanding borrowings or to pay other contractual commitments  for interest payments on debt  to pay cash dividends on common stock and to fund contributions to the company s pension and postretirement benefit plans 
the company s traditional sources of liquidity are its cash on hand  cash flows from operations and available borrowing capacity under its credit facilities 
funds may also be generated from occasional sales of non strategic crude oil and natural gas properties 
a new billion unsecured five year credit facility  with million in remaining funds available at december   will provide increased liquidity in the company s ratio of debt to book capital defined as the company s total debt divided by the sum of total debt plus equity was at december   compared to at december  significant changes in the company s financial position causing a change in the ratio of debt to book capital include increases in total debt related to the funding of the patina merger and additional capital expenditures  an increase in retained earnings from current year net income  an increase in capital in excess of par value from the issuance of stock in the patina merger  and a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income loss related to an increase in deferred hedge losses 
cash flows operating activities the company reported a million year over year increase in cash flows from operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled billion for the year ended december   compared to million in and million in the increases for and were driven by overall production increases  higher realized commodity prices and higher distributions from earnings of an equity method investee 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities totaled billion  million and million for the years ending december   and  respectively 
the company s investing activities relate primarily to the patina merger as well as expenditures made for the exploration and development of crude oil and natural gas properties 
expenditures were offset by the receipt of million  million and million from sales of assets during  and  respectively 
financing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities totaled million  million and million for the years ending december   and  respectively 
financing activities consist primarily of proceeds from and repayments of bank or other long term debt  repayment of notes payable  the payment of cash dividends and proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
during  the company had a net billion increase in outstanding debt primarily related to the patina merger 
in addition  the company received million from the exercise of stock options 
acquisition  exploration and development related expenditures values preliminarily allocated to proved and unproved crude oil and natural gas properties acquired in the patina merger were billion and billion  respectively 
the company s exploration and development related expenditure information on an accrual basis is as follows year ended december  in thousands exploration and development related expenditures exploratory drilling and completion    dry hole    lease acquisition costs    seismic    total exploration expenditures    development drilling and completion    corporate and other    total exploration and development related expenditures from consolidated operations    company s share of equity method investee s capital spending capital expenditures budget total capital expenditures during increased million  or  as compared with the increase includes million of post merger exploration and development related expenditures on patina properties 
capital expenditures during increased million  or  as compared with the increase included costs related to the acquisition of deepwater gulf of mexico interests and costs expended in further development of the amistad gas field in ecuador 
capital expenditures during were lower than budgeted amounts due to cost reductions and increased lead times for international capital outlays  offset by costs of an expanded domestic drilling program 
capital expenditures during were lower than budgeted amounts due to timing of capital outlays  which were delayed until  for certain projects in the gulf of mexico  the united kingdom  israel and phase b liquids expansion project in equatorial guinea 
capital spending in excess of budget for was primarily due to the acceleration of the initial costs to begin the phase b liquids expansion project in equatorial guinea 
discontinued operations and asset sales during  the company completed an asset disposition program  including five domestic property packages that had first been announced during july the sales price for the five property packages totaled million 
the company s consolidated financial statements have been reclassified for all periods previously presented to reflect the operations of the properties being sold as discontinued operations 
income from discontinued operations was million for the year ended december  the loss from discontinued operations of million for the year ended december  included a million million  net of tax non cash write down to market value for certain of the five property packages 
proceeds from asset sales totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the company believes the disposition of non strategic properties allows it to concentrate efforts on strategic properties and reduce leverage 
financing activities debt the company s debt totaled billion excluding unamortized discount at december   all of which was long term 
maturities range from to the company s principal source of liquidity is a new billion unsecured five year credit facility the new facility entered into in december the new facility is available a to refinance existing indebtedness of the company  and b for general corporate purposes 
the new facility is with certain commercial lending institutions and bears interest rates based upon a eurodollar rate plus a range of basis points to basis points depending upon the company s credit rating and utilization of the new facility 
the new facility has facility fees that range from basis points to basis points depending upon the company s credit rating 
at december   billion in borrowings were outstanding under the new facility 
the new facility contains customary representations and warranties and affirmative and negative covenants  including  but not limited to  the following financial covenants a the ratio of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and exploration expense to interest expense for any consecutive period of four fiscal quarters ending on the last day of a fiscal quarter may not be less than to  and b the total debt to capitalization ratio  expressed as a percentage  may not exceed at any time 
a violation of these covenants will result in a default under the new facility  which could permit the participating banks to restrict the company s ability to access the new facility and require the immediate repayment of any outstanding advances under the new facility 
at december   the ratios were to and

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk derivative instruments held for non trading purposes the company is exposed to market risk in the normal course of its business operations 
management believes that the company is well positioned with its mix of crude oil and natural gas reserves to take advantage of future price increases that may occur 
however  the uncertainty of crude oil and natural gas prices continues to impact the oil and gas industry 
due to the volatility of crude oil and natural gas prices  the company has used derivative hedging instruments and may do so in the future as a means of managing its exposure to price changes 
such instruments include variable to fixed price swaps and costless collars 
as of december   the company had open costless collar positions related to its natural gas and crude oil production as follows natural gas crude oil average price per mmbtu average price per bbl production period mmbtupd floor ceiling bopd floor ceiling nymex   brent  brent  brent  as of december   the company had open fixed price swap positions related to its natural gas and crude oil production as follows natural gas crude oil production period mmbtupd average price per mmbtu bopd average price per bbl nymex   nymex   nymex   includes derivative instruments of  mmbtupd of natural gas and  bopd of crude oil that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment at december  these derivative instruments were re designated as cash flow hedges in february the hedging instruments above represent of the company s expected worldwide natural gas production in   and  and of the company s expected worldwide crude oil production in   and as of december   the company had a net unrealized loss of billion pre tax related to crude oil and natural gas derivative instruments entered into for hedging purposes 
a net unrealized loss of  net of tax  is recorded in aoci in the shareholders equity section of the company s balance sheet and will be recognized in earnings as adjustments to revenue as the individual contracts are settled 
in anticipation of the purchase of us exploration  expected to close on or before march   noble energy has executed hedges on its own production volumes 
the hedges are for the period march through and are equivalent to just over of us exploration s expected volumes 
the hedges are in the form of collars 
the average floors on the natural gas hedges and crude oil hedges are per mmbtu and per bbl 
the average ceilings on the natural gas hedges and crude oil hedges are per mmbtu and per bbl 
the natural gas hedges are priced at the cig index and thereby include basis differentials to henry hub 
the instruments have been designated as cash flow hedges 
derivative instruments held for trading purposes nemi  from time to time  employs various derivative instruments in connection with its purchases and sales of production 
while most of the purchases are made for an index based price  customers often require prices that are either fixed or related to nymex 
in order to establish a fixed margin and mitigate the risk of price volatility  nemi may convert a fixed or nymex sale to an index based sales price such as purchasing a nymex futures contract at the henry hub with an adjoining basis swap at a physical location 
due to the size of such transactions and certain restraints imposed by contract and by noble energy guidelines  the company believes it had no material market risk exposure from these derivative instruments as of december  unrealized gains and losses are reflected in earnings as incurred 
interest rate risk the company is exposed to interest rate risk related to its variable and fixed interest rate debt 
as of december   the company had billion of debt outstanding of which million was fixed rate debt 
the company believes that anticipated near term changes in interest rates will not have a material effect on the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt and will not expose the company to the risk of earnings or cash flow loss 
the remainder of the company s debt at december  was variable rate debt and  therefore  exposes the company to the risk of earnings or cash flow loss due to changes in market interest rates 
at december   billion of variable rate debt was outstanding 
a change in the floating interest rates applicable to the december  balance would result in a change in annual interest expense of approximately million 
the company occasionally enters into forward contracts or swap agreements to hedge exposure to interest rate risk 
changes in fair value of interest rate swaps or interest rate locks used as cash flow hedges are reported in aoci  to the extent the hedge is effective  until the forecasted transaction occurs  at which time they are recorded as adjustments to interest expense 
at december   aoci included million  net of tax  related to a settled interest rate lock 
this amount is being reclassified into earnings as adjustments to interest expense over the term of the company s senior notes due april foreign currency risk the company has not entered into foreign currency derivatives 
the us dollar is considered the primary currency for each of the company s international operations 
transactions that are completed in a foreign currency are translated into us dollars and recorded in the financial statements 
transaction gains or losses were not material in any of the periods presented and the company does not believe it is currently exposed to any material risk of loss on this basis 
transaction gains or losses are included in other expense income  net on the statements of operations
