environmental matters overview keyspan s ordinary business operations subject it to regulation in accordance with various federal  state and local laws  rules and regulations dealing with the environment  including air  water  and hazardous substances 
these requirements govern both our normal  ongoing operations and the remediation of impacted properties historically used in utility operations 
potential liability associated with our historical operations may be imposed without regard to fault  even if the activities were lawful at the time they occurred 
except as set forth below  or in note to the consolidated financial statements contractual obligations and contingencies environmental matters  no material proceedings relating to environmental matters have been commenced or  to our knowledge  are contemplated by any federal  state or local agency against keyspan  and we are not a defendant in any material litigation with respect to any matter relating to the protection of the environment 
we believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with environmental laws and that requirements imposed by existing environmental laws are not likely to have a material adverse impact upon us 
we are also pursuing claims against insurance carriers and potentially responsible parties which seek the recovery of certain environmental costs associated with the investigation and remediation of contaminated properties 
we believe that investigation and remediation costs prudently incurred at facilities associated with utility operations  not recoverable through insurance or some other means  will be recoverable from our customers in accordance with the terms of our rate recovery agreements for each regulated subsidiary 
air 
the federal clean air act caa provides for the regulation of a variety of air emissions from new and existing electric generating plants 
final permits in accordance with the requirements of title v of the amendments to the caa have been issued for all of our electric generating facilities  with the exception of two mw simple cycle gas turbine facilities which were constructed in these units currently are permitted under new york state facility permits and title v permits have been timely applied for and are pending issuance by the nysdec 
renewal applications were submitted in a timely manner for existing facilities whose initial permits were to expire in to date  all of the permits except one were renewed and the remaining renewal application has been deemed complete by nysdec and is undergoing final review by the united states environmental protection agency epa 
during  a timely renewal application was submitted for a facility whose permit expires in the permits and timely renewal applications allow our electric generating plants to continue to operate without any additional significant expenditures  except as described below 
our generating facilities are located within a caa ozone non attainment and pm fine particulate matter non attainment area  and are subject to phase i  ii and iii nox reduction requirements established under the ozone transport commission otc memorandum of understanding and forthcoming requirements under the clean air interstate rule cair designed to address both ozone and particulate matter 
our previous investments in low nox boiler combustion modifications  the use of natural gas firing systems at our steam electric generating stations  and the compliance flexibility available under these cap and trade programs  have enabled keyspan to achieve the emission reductions required in a cost effective manner 
keyspan is developing its compliance strategy in response to the implementation of cair  which is expected in since detailed requirements under cair have not yet been fully articulated  it is not possible to definitively estimate capital expenditures that may be required to meet these regulatory mandates 
although it is anticipated that nox control equipment may be required at one or more of keyspan s long island facilities at a cost of between to million 
however  such amounts are recoverable from lipa pursuant to the psa  or if applicable  the psa 
in  new york state promulgated regulations which establish separate nox and so emission reduction requirements on electric generating facilities in new york state  which commenced in late for nox emissions and in for so emissions 
keyspan s facilities have been able to comply with the nox requirements without material additional capital expenditures because of previously installed emissions control equipment and gas combustion capability 
so compliance was achieved through a reduction in the sulfur content of the fuel oil used in our northport and port jefferson facilities and a further reduction is expected to be required in in  the epa issued regulations that require reductions  on a national basis  of mercury emissions from electric generating facilities on a national basis 
the mercury regulations have no impact on keyspan facilities since their application is limited to coal fired plants 
epa determined that nickel emissions from oil fired plants do not pose health risks that require regulation 
this determination has been challenged and litigation is pending 
until a final outcome is obtained  the nature and extent of the financial impact on keyspan from nickel regulation  if any  cannot be determined 
in  the governor of new york initiated a regional greenhouse gas initiative that seeks to establish a coordinated multi state plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions primarily carbon dioxide co from electric generating emission sources in the northeast 
in december of  seven northeast states  including new york  issued a memorandum of understanding capping co emissions from electric generating facilities in and  beginning in  gradually requiring a percent reduction in regional emissions by each of the seven states will be promulgating individual state rules to implement the mou 
several congressional initiatives are also under consideration that may also require greenhouse gas reductions from electric generating facilities nationwide 
at the present time it is not possible to predict the nature of the requirements which ultimately will be imposed on keyspan  nor what  if any  financial impact such requirements would have on keyspan facilities 
however  our investments in additional natural gas firing capability have resulted in approximately a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions since  while the electric generation industry as a whole increased carbon dioxide emissions by more than 
the addition of the efficient  combined cycle unit which began operation at the ravenswood generating station in has further reduced average keyspan co emission rates 
water 
the federal clean water act provides for effluent limitations  to be implemented by a permit system  to regulate the discharge of pollutants into united states waters 
we possess permits for our generating units which authorize discharges from cooling water circulating systems and chemical treatment systems 
these permits are renewed from time to time  as required by regulation 
additional capital expenditures associated with the renewal of the surface water discharge permits for our power plants will likely be required by the nysdec 
we are currently conducting studies as directed by the nysdec to determine the impacts of our discharges on aquatic resources and are engaged in discussions with the nysdec regarding the nature of capital upgrades or other mitigation measures necessary to satisfy these evolving regulatory requirements 
it is difficult to predict with any certainty the costs of such capital investments  but these upgrades are expected to cost up to million 
however  such amounts are recoverable from lipa pursuant to the psa  or applicable  the psa 
the ravenswood generating station may also require upgrades at a cost of up to million 
the actual expenditures will depend upon the outcome of the ongoing studies and the subsequent determination by the nysdec of how to apply the standards set forth in recently promulgated federal regulations under section of the clean water act designed to mitigate such impacts 
land 
the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of and certain similar state laws collectively superfund impose liability  regardless of fault  upon generators of hazardous substances even before superfund was enacted for costs associated with investigating and remediating contaminated property 
in the course of our business operations  we generate materials which  after disposal  may become subject to superfund 
from time to time  we have received notices under superfund concerning possible claims with respect to sites where hazardous substances generated by keyspan or its predecessors and other potentially responsible parties were allegedly disposed 
normally  the costs associated with such claims are allocated among the potentially responsible parties on a pro rata basis 
superfund does  however  provide for joint and several liability against a single potentially responsible party 
in the unlikely event that superfund claims were pursued against us on that basis  the costs may be material to our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
keyspan has identified certain mgp sites which were historically owned or operated by its subsidiaries or such companies predecessors 
operations at these sites between the mid s to mid s may have resulted in the release of hazardous substances 
for a discussion on our mgp sites and further information concerning environmental matters  see note to the consolidated financial statements  contractual obligations and contingencies environmental matters 
competition  regulation and rate matters competition 
over the last several years  the natural gas and electric industries have undergone significant change as market forces moved towards replacing or supplementing rate regulation through the introduction of competition 
a significant number of natural gas and electric utilities reacted to the changing structure of the energy industry by entering into business combinations  with the goal of reducing common costs  gaining size to better withstand competitive pressures and business cycles  and attaining synergies from the combination of operations 
we engaged in two such combinations  the keyspan lilco transaction in and our november acquisition of eastern and energynorth 
the ravenswood generating station  the merchant plant in our electric services segment  is subject to competitive and other risks that could adversely impact the market price for the plant s output 
such risks include  but are not limited to  the construction of new generation or transmission capacity serving the new york city market 
regulation 
public utility holding companies  like keyspan  are now regulated by the ferc pursuant to puhca and to some extent by state utility commissions through the regulation of certain affiliate transaction regulations 
our utility subsidiaries are subject to extensive federal and state regulation by ferc and state utility commissions 
our gas and electric public utility companies are subject to either or both state and federal regulation 
in general  state public utility commissions  such as the new york public service commission nypsc  the madte and the new hampshire public utilities commission nhpuc regulate the provision of retail services  including the distribution and sale of natural gas and electricity to consumers 
each of the federal and state regulators also regulates certain transactions among our affiliates 
ferc also regulates interstate natural gas transportation and electric transmission  and has jurisdiction over certain wholesale natural gas sales and wholesale electric sales 
in addition  our non utility subsidiaries are subject to a wide variety of federal  state and local laws  rules and regulations with respect to their business activities  including but not limited to those affecting public sector projects  environmental and labor laws and regulations  state licensing requirements  as well as state laws and regulations concerning the competitive retail commodity supply 
state utility commissions 
as noted above  our regulated gas distribution utility subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the nypsc  madte and nhpuc 
the nypsc regulates kedny and kedli 
although keyspan is not regulated by the nypsc  it is impacted by conditions that were included in the nypsc order authorizing the keyspan lilco transaction 
those conditions address  among other things  the manner in which keyspan  its service company subsidiaries and its unregulated subsidiaries may interact with kedny and kedli 
the nypsc also regulates the safety  reliability and certain financial transactions of our long island generating facilities and our ravenswood generating station under a lightened regulatory standard 
our kedne subsidiaries and to some extent our service companies are also subject to regulation by the madte and nhpuc 
securities and exchange commission 
as a result of the acquisition of eastern and energynorth  we became a holding company under puhca the energy act repealed puhca and replaced it with puhca effective february  whereas our corporate and financial activities and those of our subsidiaries had been subject to regulation by the sec  ferc now has jurisdiction over certain of our holding company activities 
however  the sec continues to have jurisdiction over the registration and issuance of our securities under the federal securities laws 
under our holding company structure  we have no independent operations or source of income of our own and conduct substantially all of our operations through our subsidiaries and  as a result  we depend on the earnings and cash flow of  and dividends or distributions from  our subsidiaries to provide the funds necessary to meet our debt and contractual obligations and to pay dividends to our shareholders 
furthermore  a substantial portion of our consolidated assets  earnings and cash flow is derived from the operations of our regulated utility subsidiaries  whose legal authority to pay dividends or make other distributions to us is subject to regulation by state regulatory authorities 
in addition  in november  keyspan received authorization from the sec to operate three mutual service companies 
under this order  the sec determined that  in accordance with puhca  keyspan corporate services llc kcs  keyspan utility services llc kus and keyspan engineering survey  inc keng may operate to provide various services to keyspan subsidiaries  including regulated utility companies and lipa  at cost fairly and equitably allocated among them 
the regulation of our three service companies has also been transferred to ferc under puhca federal energy regulatory commission 
ferc has jurisdiction over certain of our holding company activities  including i regulating certain transactions among our affiliates within our holding company system  ii governing the issuance  acquisition and disposition of securities and assets by certain of our public utility subsidiaries  and iii approving certain utility mergers and acquisitions 
in addition to its new authority pursuant to puhca  ferc also regulates the sale of electricity at wholesale and the transmission of electricity in interstate commerce as well as certain corporate and financial activities of companies that are engaged in such activities 
the long island generating facilities and the ravenswood generating station are subject to ferc regulation based on their wholesale energy transactions 
our ravenswood generating station s rates are based on a market based rate application approved by ferc 
the rates that our ravenswood generating station may charge are subject to ferc mandated mitigation measures due to market power issues 
the mitigation measures are administered by the nyiso 
ferc retains the ability in future proceedings  either on its own motion or upon a complaint filed with ferc  to modify the ravenswood generating station s rates  as well as the mitigation measures  if ferc concludes that it is in the public interest to do so 
keyspan currently offers and sells the energy  capacity and ancillary services from the ravenswood generating station through the energy market operated by the nyiso 
for information concerning the nyiso  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation regulatory issues and competitive environment 
ferc also has jurisdiction to regulate certain natural gas sales for resale in interstate commerce  the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce and  unless an exemption applies  companies engaged in such activities 
the natural gas distribution activities of kedny  kedli  kedne and certain related intrastate gas transportation functions are not subject to ferc jurisdiction 
however  to the extent that kedny  kedli or kedne purchase or sell gas for resale in interstate commerce  such transactions are subject to ferc jurisdiction and have been authorized by ferc 
our interests in iroquois  honeoye  steuben and keyspan lng are also fully regulated by ferc as natural gas companies

item a 
risk factors certain statements contained in this annual report on form k concerning expectations  beliefs  plans  objectives  goals  strategies  future events or performance and underlying assumptions and other statements that are other than statements of historical facts  are forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
without limiting the foregoing  all statements under the captions item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk relating to our future outlook  anticipated capital expenditures  future cash flows and borrowings  pursuit of potential acquisition opportunities and sources of funding  are forward looking statements 
such forward looking statements reflect numerous assumptions and involve a number of risks and uncertainties  and actual results may differ materially from those discussed in such statements 
the risks  uncertainties and factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include but are not limited to the following we are a holding company  and our subsidiaries are subject to state regulation which limits their ability to pay dividends and make distributions to us we are a holding company with no business operations or sources of income of our own 
we conduct all of our operations through our subsidiaries and depend on the earnings and cash flow of  and dividends or distributions from  our subsidiaries to provide the funds necessary to meet our debt and contractual obligations and to pay dividends on our common stock 
in addition  a substantial portion of our consolidated assets  earnings and cash flow is derived from the operation of our regulated utility subsidiaries  whose legal authority to pay dividends or make other distributions to us is subject to regulation by the utility regulatory commissions of new york  massachusetts and new hampshire 
pursuant to nypsc orders  the ability of kedny and kedli to pay dividends to us is conditioned upon their maintenance of a utility capital structure with debt not exceeding and  respectively  of total utility capitalization 
in addition  the level of dividends paid by both utilities may not be increased from current levels if a basis point penalty is incurred under a customer service performance program 
at the end of kedny s and kedli s rate years september  and november   respectively  their ratios of debt to total utility capitalization were well in compliance with the ratios set forth above and we have incurred no penalties under the outstanding customer service performance program 
our gas distribution and electric services businesses may be adversely affected by changes in federal and state regulation the regulatory environment applicable to our gas distribution and our electric services businesses has undergone substantial changes in recent years  on both the federal and state levels 
these changes have significantly affected the nature of the gas and electric utility and power industries and the manner in which their participants conduct their businesses 
moreover  existing statutes and regulations may be revised or reinterpreted  new laws and regulations may be adopted or become applicable to us or our facilities and future changes in laws and regulations may affect our gas distribution and our electric services businesses in ways that we cannot predict 
in addition  our operations are subject to extensive government regulation and require numerous permits  approvals and certificates from various federal  state and local governmental agencies 
a significant portion of our revenues in our gas distribution and electric services segments are directly dependent on rates established by federal or state regulatory authorities  and any change in these rates and regulatory structure could significantly impact our financial results 
increases in utility costs other than gas  not otherwise offset by increases in revenues or reductions in other expenses  could have an adverse effect on earnings due to the time lag associated with obtaining regulatory approval to recover such increased costs and expenses in rates 
various rulemaking proposals and market design revisions related to the wholesale power market are being reviewed at the federal level 
these proposals  as well as legislative and other attention to the electric power industry could have a material adverse effect on our strategies and results of operations for our electric services business and our financial condition 
in particular  we sell capacity  energy and ancillary services from our ravenswood generating station facility into the new york independent system operator  or nyiso  energy market at market based rates  subject to mitigation measures approved by the ferc 
the pricing for capacity  energy sales and ancillary services in to the nyiso market is still evolving 
and some of the ferc s price mitigation measures are subject to rehearing and possible judicial review  as well as revision in response to market participant complaints or nyiso requests 
our risk mitigation techniques such as hedging and purchase of insurance may not adequately provide protection to mitigate our financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations  keyspan routinely enters into contracts to hedge a portion of our purchase and sale commitments  weather fluctuations  electricity sales  natural gas supply and other commodities 
however  we do not always cover the entire exposure of our assets or our positions to market price volatility and the coverage will vary over time 
to the extent we have unhedged positions or our hedging procedures do not work as planned  fluctuating commodity prices could cause our sales and net income to be volatile 
in addition  our business is subject to many hazards from which our insurance may not adequately provide coverage 
an unexpected outage at our ravenswood generating station  especially in the significant summer period  could materially impact our financial results 
damage to pipelines  equipment  properties and people caused by natural disasters  accidents  terrorism or other damage by third parties could exceed our insurance coverage 
although we do have insurance to protect against many of these contingent liabilities  this insurance is capped at certain levels  has self insured retentions and does not provide coverage for all liabilities 
sec rules for exploration and production companies may require us to recognize a non cash impairment charge at the end of our reporting periods our investments in natural gas and oil consist of our ownership of keyspan exploration and production and seneca upshur 
we use the full cost method for keyspan exploration and production and seneca upshur 
under the full cost method  all costs of acquisition  exploration and development of natural gas and oil reserves are capitalized into a full cost pool as incurred  and properties in the pool are depleted and charged to operations using the unit of production method based on production and proved reserve quantities 
to the extent that these capitalized costs  net of accumulated depletion  less deferred taxes exceed the present value using a discount rate of estimated future net cash flows from proved natural gas and oil reserves and the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties  those excess costs are charged to operations 
if a write down is required  it would result in a charge to earnings but would not have an impact on cash flows 
once incurred  an impairment of gas properties is not reversible at a later date  even if gas prices increase 
our operating results may fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis our gas distribution business is a seasonal business and is subject to weather conditions 
we receive most of our gas distribution revenues in the first and fourth quarters  when demand for natural gas increases due to colder weather conditions 
as a result  we are subject to seasonal variations in working capital because we purchase natural gas supplies for storage in the second and third quarters and must finance these purchases 
accordingly  our results of operations fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis 
in addition  our new england based gas distribution subsidiaries do not have weather normalization tariffs  as we do in new york  and results from our ravenswood generating station facility are directly correlated to the weather as the demand and price for the electricity it generates increases during extreme temperature conditions 
as a result  fluctuations in weather between years may have a significant effect on our results of operations for these subsidiaries 
a substantial portion of our revenues are derived from our agreements with lipa and no assurances can be made that these arrangements will not be discontinued at some point in the future or that the new agreements will become effective 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenues in our electric services segment from a series of agreements with lipa pursuant to which we manage lipa s transmission and distribution system and supply the majority of lipa s customers electricity needs 
on february   keyspan and lipa entered into amended and restated agreements whereby keyspan will continue to operate and maintain the electric t d system owned by lipa on long island 
as part of the amended agreements  the gpra  pursuant to which lipa had the option  through december   to acquire substantially all of the electric generating facilities owned by keyspan on long island is replaced with the option agreement where lipa only has the right to acquire two of our facilities  our far rockaway and or ef barrett generating stations during the period january  to december  additionally  the new agreements resolve many outstanding issues between the parties regarding the current lipa agreements and provide new pricing and extensions of the agreements 
there is a risk that these agreements will not receive the necessary governmental approvals  which are pending  and the effectiveness of each of the lipa agreements is conditioned upon all of the lipa agreements becoming effective 
if the lipa agreements do not become effective  there is uncertainty as to whether lipa will exercise their option under the gpra and the status of the resolution of the various disputes between keyspan and lipa 
a decline or an otherwise negative change in the ratings or outlook on our securities could have a materially adverse impact on our ability to secure additional financing on favorable terms the credit rating agencies that rate our debt securities regularly review our financial condition and results of operations 
we can provide no assurances that the ratings or outlook on our debt securities will not be reduced or otherwise negatively changed 
a negative change in the ratings or outlook on our debt securities could have a materially adverse impact on our ability to secure additional financing on favorable terms 
our costs of compliance with environmental laws are significant  and the cost of compliance with future environmental laws could adversely affect us our operations are subject to extensive federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations relating to air quality  water quality  waste management  natural resources and the health and safety of our employees 
these environmental laws and regulations expose us to costs and liabilities relating to our operations and our current and formerly owned properties 
compliance with these legal requirements requires us to commit significant capital toward environmental monitoring  installation of pollution control equipment and permits at our facilities 
costs of compliance with environmental regulations  and in particular emission regulations  could have a material impact on our electric services segment and our results of operations and financial position  especially if emission limits are tightened  more extensive permitting requirements are imposed  additional substances become regulated or the number and type of electric generating plants we operate increase 
in addition  we are responsible for the clean up of contamination at certain mgp sites and at other sites and are aware of additional mgp sites where we may have responsibility for clean up costs 
while our gas utility subsidiaries rate plans generally allow for the full recovery of the costs of investigation and remediation of most of our mgp sites  these rate recovery mechanisms may change in the future 
to the extent rate recovery mechanisms change in the future  or if additional environmental matters arise in the future at our currently or historically owned facilities  at sites we may acquire in the future or at third party waste disposal sites  costs associated with investigating and remediating these sites could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
our businesses are subject to competition and general economic conditions impacting demand for services we recently expanded the ravenswood facility  our merchant generation plant  in our electric services segment with the ravenswood expansion  a mw combined cycle generating unit 
however  the ravenswood facility and ravenswood expansion continue to be subject to competition that could adversely impact the market price for the capacity  energy and ancillary services they sell 
in addition  if new generation and or transmission facilities are constructed  and or the availability of our ravenswood generating station deteriorates  then the quantities of capacity and energy sales could be adversely affected 
in december  nypa completed construction of a nominal mw generating facility in new york city  and it began selling its capacity and energy into the nyiso markets 
in addition  another nominal mw facility is expected to come on line in we cannot predict  however  when or if new power plants or transmission facilities in addition to the above noted resources will be built or the nature of the future new york city capacity and energy requirements 
competition facing our unregulated energy services businesses  including but not limited to competition from other heating  ventilation and air conditioning  and engineering companies  as well as  other utilities and utility holding companies that are permitted to engage in such activities  could adversely impact our financial results and the value of those businesses  resulting in decreased earnings as well as write downs of the carrying value of those businesses 
our gas distribution segment faces competition with distributors of alternative fuels and forms of energy  including fuel oil and propane 
our ability to continue to add new gas distribution customers may significantly impact financial results 
the gas distribution industry has experienced a decrease in consumption per customer over time  partially due to increased efficiency of customers appliances  economic factors and price elasticity 
in addition  our gas distribution segment s future growth is dependent upon the ability to add new customers to our system in a cost effective manner 
while our long island and new england utilities have significant growth potential  we cannot be sure new customers will continue to offset the decrease in consumption of our existing customer base 
there are a number of factors outside of our control that impact customer conversions from an alternative fuel to gas  including general economic factors impacting customers willingness to invest in new gas equipment 
risk associated with our financial swap agreement for in city unforced capacity keyspan believes that the new york city market represents a strong capacity market due to  among other things  its local reliability rules which recently increased to from  increasing demand and the time required for new resources to be constructed 
keyspan anticipates that demand will increase and that the high cost to construct capacity in new york city will result in favorable in city unforced capacity prices 
therefore  keyspan entered into an isda master agreement for a fixed for floating unforced capacity financial swap for a notional quantity of  kw at the fixed price is kw month 
if the demand is less than keyspan s estimates  additional resources enter the market  or costs are less than forecast  in city unforced capacity prices could be on average less than the fixed price resulting in a loss to keyspan  which under certain circumstances could be material 
labor disruptions at our facilities could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow approximately  employees  or of our employees  are represented by unions through various collective bargaining agreements that expire between and the bargaining agreements expiring in affect approximately  employees who primarily work for kedne and at our ravenswood generating station 
keyspan is currently engaging in discussions with these unions for new collective bargaining agreements 
it is possible that our employees may seek an increase in wages and benefits at the expiration of these agreements  and that we may be unable to negotiate new agreements without labor disruption 
counterparties to our transactions may fail to perform their obligations  which could harm our results of operations our operations are exposed to the risk that counterparties to our transactions that owe us money or supplies will not perform their obligations 
should the counterparties to arrangements with us fail to perform  we might be forced to enter into alternative hedging arrangements or honor our underlying commitment at then current market prices that may exceed our contractual prices 
in such event  we might incur additional losses to the extent of amounts  if any  already paid to counterparties 
this risk is most significant where we have concentrations of receivables from natural gas and electric utilities and their affiliates  as well as industrial customers and marketers throughout the northeastern united states 
we are exposed to risks that are beyond our control the cost of repairing damage to our operating subsidiaries facilities and the potential disruption of their operations or supplier operations due to storms  natural disasters  wars  terrorist acts and other catastrophic events could be substantial 
the occurrence or risk of occurrence of future terrorist attacks or related acts of war may lead to increased political  economic and financial market instability and volatility in prices for natural gas which could materially adversely affect us in ways we cannot predict at this time 
a lower level of economic activity for these or other reasons could result in a decline in energy consumption  which could adversely affect our net revenues 
the long term financial condition of our gas distribution business depends on the continued availability of natural gas reserves the development of additional natural gas reserves requires significant capital expenditures by others for exploring  drilling and installing production  gathering  storage  transportation and other facilities that permit natural gas to be produced and delivered to our distribution systems 
low prices for natural gas  regulatory restrictions  or the lack of available capital for these projects could adversely affect the development of additional natural gas reserves 
additional natural gas reserves may not be developed in sufficient amounts to fill the capacities of our distribution systems  thus limiting our prospects for long term growth 
gathering  processing and transporting activities involve numerous risks that may result in accidents and other operating risks and costs our gas distribution facilities pose a variety of hazards and operating risks  such as leaks  explosions and mechanical problems caused by natural disasters  accidents  terrorism or other damage by third parties  which could cause substantial financial losses 
in addition to impairing our operations  these risks could also result in loss of human life and environmental pollution 
in accordance with standard industry practice  we maintain insurance against some  but not all  of these potential risks and losses 
the occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
additional risks  uncertainties and factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include but are not limited to the following volatility of fuel prices used to generate electricity  fluctuations in weather and in gas and electric prices  our ability to successfully manage our cost structure and operate efficiently  our ability to successfully contract for natural gas supplies required to meet the needs of our customers  implementation of new accounting standards or changes in accounting standards or gaap which may require adjustment to financial statements  inflationary trends and interest rates  the ability of keyspan to identify and make complementary acquisitions  as well as the successful integration of such acquisitions  retention of key personnel  federal  state and local regulatory initiatives that threaten cost and investment recovery  and place limits on the type and manner in which we invest in new businesses and conduct operations  the impact of federal  state and local utility regulatory policies and orders on our regulated and unregulated businesses  the degree to which we develop unregulated business ventures  as well as federal and state regulatory policies affecting our ability to retain and operate such business ventures profitably  a change in the fair market value of our investments that could cause a significant change in the carrying value of such investments or the carrying value of related goodwill  timely receipts of payments from lipa and the nyiso  our two largest customers  and other risks detailed from time to time in other reports and other documents filed by keyspan with the sec

recent developments on february   keyspan entered into an agreement and plan of merger the merger agreement  with national grid plc  a public limited company incorporated under the laws of england and wales parent and national grid usa  inc  a new york corporation merger sub  pursuant to which merger sub will merge with and into keyspan the merger  with keyspan continuing as the surviving company 
pursuant to the merger agreement  at the effective time of the merger  each outstanding share of common stock  par value 
per share of keyspan the shares  other than shares owned by keyspan  shall be canceled and shall be converted into the right to receive in cash  without interest 
consummation of the merger is subject to various closing conditions  including but not limited to the satisfaction or waiver of conditions regarding the receipt of requisite regulatory approvals and the adoption of the merger agreement by the stockholders of keyspan and the parent 
assuming receipt or waiver of the foregoing  it is currently anticipated that the merger will be consummated in early accordingly  any statements contained herein concerning expectations  beliefs  plans  objectives  goals  strategies  future events or performance and underlying assumptions are forward looking statements and do not take into account the occurrence or impact of any potential strategic transaction on the future operations  financial condition and cash flows of keyspan 
however  no assurance can be given that the merger will occur  or  the timing of its completion 
at december   keyspan was a holding company under the public utility holding company act of  as amended puhca 
in august  the energy policy act of the energy act was enacted 
the energy act is a broad energy bill that places an increased emphasis on the production of energy and promotes the development of new technologies and alternative energy sources and provides tax credits to companies that produce natural gas  oil  coal  electricity and renewable energy 
for keyspan  one of the more significant provisions of the energy act is the repeal of puhca  which became effective on february  since that time  the jurisdiction of the securities and exchange commission sec over certain holding company activities  including the regulation of our affiliate transactions and service companies  has been transferred to the jurisdiction of the federal energy regulatory commission ferc pursuant to the public utility holding company act of puhca 
see regulation and rate matters for additional information on the energy act and puhca executive summary below is a table comparing the more significant items impacting earnings from continuing operations and earnings available for common stock for the periods indicated 
in millions of dollars  except per share amounts year ended december  earnings eps earnings eps earnings eps earnings from continuing operations  less preferred stock dividends discontinued operations cummulative change in accounting principle earnings for common stock components of continuing operations core operations asset sales non core operations impairment charges debt redemption costs earnings from continuing operations  less preferred stock dividends earnings from continuing operations vs keyspan s earnings from continuing operations  less preferred stock dividends  for the year ended december  were million or per share  a decrease of million  or per share compared to million  or per share realized in keyspan s financial results for the year ended december  and  reflect the following items that had a significant impact on comparative results i earnings from core operations  ii asset sales of non core subsidiaries recorded in and their respective results for  iii impairment charges recorded in  and iv debt redemption charges recorded in both and as indicated in the above table  keyspan s earnings from core operations increased million or per share in  primarily reflecting higher earnings from the electric services segment  improved results from the energy services segment  and a decrease in interest charges 
keyspan s electric services operations benefited from an increase in net electric revenues principally as a result of improved pricing due  in part  to the warm weather during the summer 
lower operating losses were incurred at the energy services segment as a result of lower operating expenses 
the decrease in interest expense resulted from the benefits attributable to lower outstanding debt resulting from debt redemptions in and the first quarter of  as well as from the sale of houston exploration and keyspan canada 
these favorable results were somewhat offset by a decrease in operating income from keyspan s gas distribution operations as a result of higher operating expenses  primarily due to an increase in the provision for uncollectible accounts receivable as a result of increasing gas costs and the adverse impact from recent collection experience 
the full benefit to earnings per share from the favorable operating results of the electric services and energy services segments  as well as the decrease in interest charges was offset by the higher level of common shares outstanding 
on may   keyspan issued million shares of common stock upon the scheduled conversion of the meds equity units 
the dilutive effect of this issuance on earnings per share for the year ended december   was approximately per share 
see note to the consolidated financial statements long term debt and commercial paper for additional details on the meds equity units 
the remaining items impacting comparative earnings from continuing operations asset sales  impairment charges and debt redemption charges are discussed below 
during  keyspan sold its remaining equity interest in the houston exploration company houston exploration  an independent natural gas and oil exploration company based in houston  texas 
we received cash proceeds of approximately million in two stock transactions that resulted in after tax gains of million  or per share 
the first transaction occurred in june and the second transaction was completed in november the operations of houston exploration were fully consolidated in keyspan s consolidated financial statements during the first five months of  but were then accounted for on the equity method of accounting after the first transaction reduced our ownership interest below 
also in  keyspan sold its remaining investment in keyspan energy canada partnership keyspan canada  a company that owned certain midstream natural gas assets in western canada 
we received cash proceeds of approximately million in two transactions that resulted in a total after tax gain of million  or per share 
the first transaction took place in april and the second transaction was completed in december the operations of keyspan canada were fully consolidated in keyspan s consolidated financial statements during the first three months of  but then were accounted for on the equity method of accounting after the first transaction reduced our ownership interest below 
combined  these asset sales provided keyspan with approximately billion in cash proceeds and after tax earnings of million  or per share 
further  during  keyspan s share of the after tax operating earnings of houston exploration and keyspan canada was million or per share 
see note to the consolidated financial statements business segments and the discussions under the caption review of operating segments for a more detailed discussion of each of the above noted non core transactions 
keyspan recorded three significant impairment charges during i a goodwill impairment charge recorded in the energy services segment  ii a ceiling test write down recorded in the energy investments segment  and iii a carrying value impairment charge also recorded in the energy investments segment 
these impairment charges resulted in after tax charges to continuing operations of million  or per share 
specifically  the energy services segment recorded an after tax non cash goodwill impairment charge of million  or per share in continuing operations as a result of an evaluation of the carrying value of goodwill recorded in this segment 
that evaluation resulted in a total impairment charge of million after tax  or per share million of this charge was attributable to continuing operations  while the remaining million  or per share  was reflected in discontinued operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements energy services discontinued operations for additional details on this charge 
keyspan s remaining wholly owned gas exploration and production subsidiaries recorded a non cash impairment charge of million million after tax  or per share in to recognize the reduced valuation of proved reserves 
see note to the consolidated financial statements gas exploration and production property depletion  for additional details on this charge 
in addition to the asset sales noted previously  in the fourth quarter of  keyspan anticipated selling its previous ownership interest in premier transmission limited premier  a gas pipeline from southwest scotland to northern ireland 
in the fourth quarter of  keyspan recorded a non cash impairment charge of million million after tax or per share  reflecting the difference between the anticipated cash proceeds from the sale of premier compared to its carrying value 
this investment was accounted for under the equity method of accounting in the energy investments segment 
the sale of premier was completed in the first quarter of and resulted in cash proceeds of approximately million and a pre tax gain of million reflecting the difference from earlier estimates 
see note to the consolidated financial statements business segments and the discussions under the caption review of operating segments for a more detailed discussion of the sale 
the remaining significant item impacting comparative results  as noted above  was debt redemption costs incurred in both and in  keyspan redeemed million of notes due in keyspan incurred million in call premiums  which were expensed and recorded in other income and deductions on the consolidated statement of income  and wrote off million of previously deferred financing costs 
further  keyspan accelerated the amortization of approximately million of previously unamortized benefits associated with an interest rate swap on these notes 
the accelerated amortization was recorded as a reduction to interest expense 
the net after tax expense of this debt redemption was million or per share 
see note to the consolidated financial statements long term debt and commercial paper as well as the discussion under the caption financing for additional details on this transaction 
in  keyspan redeemed approximately million of various series of outstanding long term debt 
keyspan incurred million in call premiums associated with these redemptions  of which was expensed and recorded in other income and deductions on the consolidated statement of income 
the remaining amount of the call premiums have been deferred for future rate recovery 
further  keyspan wrote off million of previously deferred financing costs which have been reflected in interest expense on the consolidated statement of income 
the total after tax expense of the debt redemption was million or per share 
the net impact of the above mentioned items resulted in a decrease to earnings from continuing operations of million or per share for the year ended december   compared to a gain of million  or per share  in earnings available for common stock vs earnings available for common stock also include losses from discontinued operations associated with keyspan s former mechanical contracting subsidiaries  these companies were discontinued in the fourth quarter of and sold in early in the fourth quarter of  keyspan s investment in its mechanical contracting subsidiaries was written down to fair value 
during  operating losses amounting to million after tax were incurred through the dates of sale of these companies  including  but not limited to  costs incurred for employee related benefits 
partially offsetting these losses was an after tax gain of million associated with the related divestitures  reflecting the difference between the fair value estimates and the financial impact of the actual sale transactions 
the net income impact of the operating losses and the disposal gain was a loss of million  or per share for the year ended december  further  earnings available for common stock for include a million  or per share  cumulative change in accounting principle charge as a result of implementing the accounting requirements of fasb interpretation no 
fin accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations 
this pronouncement required keyspan to record a liability for the estimated future cost associated with the legal obligation to dispose of long lived assets at the time of their retirement or disposal date 
upon initial implementation  december   a cumulative change in accounting principle charge was recorded on keyspan s consolidated statement of income  representing the present value of keyspan s future retirement obligation 
see note to the consolidated financial statements contractual obligations  financial guarantees and contingencies for further information on this charge 
as previously noted  in keyspan conducted an evaluation of the carrying value of its investments in the energy services segment 
as a result of this evaluation  keyspan recorded a loss in discontinued operations of million  or per share 
this loss reflects a million after tax impairment charge to reflect a reduction to the carrying value of assets associated with our mechanical contracting activities and operating losses of million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements energy services discontinued operations for additional details on these items 
earnings from continuing operations vs keyspan s earnings from continuing operations  less preferred stock dividends  for the year ended december   were million or per share  an increase of million  or per share compared to million  or per share realized in keyspan s financial results for the year ended december  and reflect the following items that had a significant impact on comparative results i earnings from core operations  ii non core asset sales recorded in both and  iii impairment charges recorded in  and iv debt redemption charges recorded in both and as indicated in the table above  keyspan s earnings from core operations increased million or per share for the twelve months ended december  compared to  primarily reflecting an increase in net electric revenues associated with keyspan s electric services segment  as well as from higher earnings from the gas distribution segment  primarily due to a boston gas company rate increase resulting from a rate proceeding concluded in november the remaining items impacting comparative earnings from continuing operations asset sales  impairment charges and debt redemption charges are discussed below 
as noted previously  during keyspan sold its ownership interests in houston exploration and keyspan canada 
combined  these asset sales provided keyspan with approximately billion of cash proceeds and after tax earnings of million  or per share 
further  during  keyspan s share of the after tax operating earnings of houston exploration and keyspan canada was million or per share 
during  keyspan completed two non core asset sales 
keyspan sold a interest in keyspan canada and a interest in taylor ngl lp which owned and operated two extraction plants in canada 
we recorded an after tax loss of million  or per share  associated with these sales 
additionally  we reduced our ownership interest in houston exploration from to approximately following the repurchase  by houston exploration  of three million shares of common stock owned by keyspan 
we recorded a gain of million  or per share  on this transaction 
income taxes were not provided on this transaction since the transaction was structured as a return of capital 
keyspan s share of the after tax operating earnings of houston exploration and keyspan canada was million or per share for the twelve months ended december  further  in the fourth quarter of  we completed the sale of a interest in phoenix natural gas  a natural gas distribution company located in northern ireland  and recorded an after tax gain of million  or per share 
in total  keyspan recorded a pre tax gain of million from the monetization of non core assets 
the combined after tax gain from these asset sales was minimal due to the tax treatment associated with each transaction 
see note to the consolidated financial statements business segments and the discussions under the caption review of operating segments for a more detailed discussion of each of the above noted non core transactions 
as previously noted  keyspan recorded three significant impairment charges during i a goodwill impairment charge recorded in the energy services segment of million after tax  or per share  million of which was attributable to continuing operations  while the remaining million  or per share  was reflected in discontinued operations  ii an after tax ceiling test write down of million  or per share  to recognize the reduced valuation of proved reserves associated with keyspan s wholly owned gas exploration and production subsidiaries  and iii a non cash impairment charge of million  million after tax or per share  recorded in the energy investments segment reflecting the difference between the anticipated cash proceeds from the sale of premier compared to its carrying value 
the remaining significant item noted above is debt redemption costs incurred in and as noted previously  in  keyspan redeemed approximately million of outstanding long term debt 
the total after tax expense of this debt redemption was million or per share 
in  keyspan incurred million in debt redemption costs associated with the redemption of approximately million of outstanding promissory notes that were issued to lipa in connection with the keyspan long island lighting company lilco business combination completed in may further  houston exploration  then a consolidated subsidiary  incurred debt redemption costs of million  to retire million notes 
the total after tax expense of the debt redemptions in was million or per share 
the net impact of the above mentioned items resulted in an increase to earnings from continuing operations of million  or per share for the year ended december   compared to million or per share in earnings available for common stock vs earnings available for common stock for the year ended december  also include losses from discontinued operations of million  or per share 
this loss includes million of after tax impairment charges to reflect a reduction to the carrying value of assets associated with keyspan s former mechanical contracting subsidiaries and operating losses of million 
earnings available for common stock for the year ended december   also reflect an operating loss from discontinued operations associated with keyspan s former mechanical contracting subsidiaries of million  or per share and a charge for a cumulative change in accounting principle 
in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued financial interpretation number fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
this interpretation required keyspan to  among other things  consolidate the ravenswood master lease the lease under which keyspan leases and operates a portion of the ravenswood electric generating facility the ravenswood facility and classify the lease obligation as long term debt on the consolidated balance sheet starting december  as a result of implementing fin  we recognized a non cash  after tax charge of million  or per share related to catch up depreciation of the facility since its acquisition in june and recorded the charge as a cumulative change in accounting principle 
see note to the consolidated financial statements contractual obligations  financial guarantees and contingencies for an explanation of the leasing arrangement for the ravenswood facility  as well as an explanation of the implementation of fin consolidated summary of results operating income by segment  as well as consolidated earnings available for common stock is set forth in the following table for the periods indicated 
year ended december  in millions of dollars  except per share amounts gas distribution electric services energy services operations goodwill impairment charge energy investments operations of continuing companies operations of sold companies ceiling test write down and impairment charge eliminations and other operating income  other income and deductions interest charges gain on sale of assets cost of debt redemption minority interest other income and deductions income taxes income from continuing operations loss from discontinued operations cumulative change in accounting principles net income preferred stock dividend requirements earnings for common stock basic earnings per share continuing operations  less preferred stock dividends discontinued operations cumulative change in accounting principles operating income vs as indicated in the above table  operating income decreased million  or  for the twelve months ended december  compared to the same period of the comparative operating results reflect the following two items that had a significant impact on results i operating results of non core subsidiaries recorded in  offset by ii impairment charges recorded in as noted earlier  during keyspan held equity ownership interests in houston exploration and keyspan canada 
for the twelve months ended december   keyspan s share of the combined operating income of houston exploration and keyspan canada was million 
keyspan sold its remaining ownership interest in these non core operations in the fourth quarter of offsetting this income to some extent were pre tax non cash impairment charges of million recorded in as noted earlier  keyspan recorded the following three impairment charges during i a goodwill impairment charge recorded in the energy services segment attributable to continuing operations of million  ii a ceiling test write down of million to recognize the reduced valuation of proved reserves associated with keyspan s wholly owned gas exploration and production subsidiaries  and iii a non cash impairment charge of million also recorded in the energy investments segment reflecting the difference between the anticipated cash proceeds from the sale of premier compared to its carrying value 
the combined impact of the non core operating income recorded in offset by the impairment charges contributed million to operating income for the twelve months ended december  keyspan s core businesses  therefore  posted an increase in operating income of million for the twelve months ended december   compared to the same period of  primarily reflecting an increase of million in the electric services segment  partially offset by a million decrease in the gas distribution segment 
the favorable results from keyspan s electric services operations reflect an increase in net electric revenues as a result of higher electric prices that were due  in part  to the warm weather during the summer of gas distribution results  however  were adversely impacted by higher operating expenses  primarily due to an increase in the provision for uncollectible accounts receivable as a result of higher gas costs and by higher property taxes 
for the most part  the beneficial impact on comparative operating income from lower net operating losses incurred at the energy services segment  was offset by an increase in expenses residing at the holding company level 
further  in keyspan reached a settlement with certain of its insurance carriers regarding cost recovery for expenses incurred at a non utility environmental site and recorded an million gain from the settlement as a reduction to expense 
other income and deductions reflects interest charges  costs associated with debt redemptions  income from subsidiary stock transactions  minority interest charges and other miscellaneous items 
for the twelve months ended december   other income and deductions reflects a net expense of million compared to income of million for the twelve months ended december  this unfavorable variation of is due to higher gains from asset sales recorded in compared to of million  offset by a decrease in interest charges of million  lower debt redemption costs of million and the absence of minority interest expenses of million 
the following is a discussion of these items 
as noted earlier  in the first quarter of  keyspan finalized its sale of premier 
the final sale of premier resulted in a pre tax gain of million reflecting the difference from earlier estimates and what was recorded in the first quarter of for the twelve months ended december   keyspan realized pre tax income of million from subsidiary stock transactions associated with houston exploration and keyspan canada  as discussed earlier 
interest expense decreased million  or  for the twelve months ended december   compared to the same period of  reflecting the benefits attributable to recent debt redemptions  as well as the sale of houston exploration and keyspan canada 
in addition  as noted earlier  in keyspan redeemed million series notes due keyspan incurred million in call premiums  wrote off million of previously deferred financing costs and accelerated the amortization of approximately million of previously unamortized benefits associated with an interest rate swap on these bonds 
the accelerated amortization of the interest rate swap and the write off of previously deferred financing costs reduced interest expense in by million 
in  keyspan redeemed approximately million of various series of outstanding debt and incurred million in call premiums and wrote off million of previously deferred financing costs 
the net impact of the and debt redemptions lowered comparative interest expense by million 
for the year ended december  other income and deductions also includes the effects of minority interest of million related to our previous majority ownership interests in houston exploration and keyspan canada 
finally  other income and deductions for the year ended december  reflects a million gain recorded on the settlement of a derivative financial instrument entered into in connection with the sale leaseback transaction associated with the ravenswood expansion  a mw combined cycle generating facility located at the ravenswood site  as well as a million foreign currency gain 
income taxes decreased million for the year ended december  compared to last year due  for the most part  to lower pre tax earnings 
in addition  tax expense for reflects i a million benefit resulting from a revised appraisal associated with property that was disposed of in  ii a tax benefit of million related to the repatriation of earnings from keyspan s foreign investments  and iii the beneficial tax treatment afforded the stock transaction with houston exploration 
as noted earlier  earnings available for common stock for the year ended december   also includes losses of million  or per share  from discontinued operations  as well as a million  or per share cumulative change in accounting principles charge 
earnings available for common stock for the year ended december   includes losses of million  or per share  from discontinued operations 
as a result of the items discussed above  earnings available for common stock were million  or per share for the year ended december   compared to million  or per share realized in operating income vs operating income decreased million  or  for the twelve months ended december   compared to the same period of comparative operating income was adversely impacted by lower operating income from the energy investments segment as a result of keyspan s reduced ownership interest in houston exploration and keyspan canada during the latter half of keyspan s lower ownership level in these former subsidiaries reduced comparative operating income by million 
in addition  operating income in the energy investments segment was adversely impacted by the million non cash impairment charge to recognize the reduced valuation of proved reserves  as well as the million non cash impairment charge associated with our previous investment in premier 
further  the decrease in operating income reflects the million non cash goodwill impairment charge recorded in the energy services segment 
the combined impact of the decrease in non core operating income and the impairment charges recorded in reduced operating income for the twelve months ended december   by million 
keyspan s core businesses  therefore  posted an increase in operating income of million for the twelve months ended december  compared to the same period of  primarily reflecting increases of million in the electric services segment  million in the gas distribution segment and million from the continuing operations in the energy investments segment 
the increase in comparative operating income in the electric services segment in primarily reflects higher net electric margins associated with the ravenswood expansion 
the gas distribution segment benefited from customer additions and oil to gas conversions throughout our service territories  as well as from the full effect of the rate increase resulting from the boston gas company rate proceeding concluded in november in  we recorded million in gains from property sales  primarily the sale of acres of real property located on long island  that were recorded in the gas distribution segment 
the continuing operations in the energy investments segment realized higher earnings from the sale of property  as well as from an increase in earnings from gas pipeline investments and generally lower administrative costs 
see the discussion under the caption review of operating segments for further details on each segment 
other income and deductions reflects interest charges  costs associated with debt redemptions  income from subsidiary stock transactions  minority interest charges and other miscellaneous items 
for the twelve months ended december   other income and deductions reflects a net gain of million compared to a net expense of million for the twelve months ended december  this favorable variation of million is due to higher gains from asset sales recorded in compared to of million and a lower minority interest adjustment of million  offset by an increase in interest charges of million and higher debt redemption costs of million 
the following is a discussion of these items 
as noted earlier  for the twelve months ended december   keyspan realized pre tax income of million from subsidiary stock transactions associated with houston exploration and keyspan canada 
during  we monetized a portion of our canadian and northern ireland investments  as well as a portion of our ownership interest in houston exploration and recorded a net gain of million associated with these transactions 
further  the lower ownership level in houston exploration and keyspan canada in resulted in an associated decrease in the minority interest adjustment of million 
the increase in interest expense of million  or  in  compared to the prior year  reflects a number of items 
as noted earlier  interest expense for includes the write off of million of previously deferred issuance costs as a result of the redemption of million of outstanding long term debt 
in addition  interest expense in was impacted by the implementation of fin  discussed earlier 
beginning january   lease payments associated with the ravenswood master lease have been reflected as interest expense on the consolidated statement of income resulting in an increase to interest expense of approximately million in see note contractual obligations  financial guarantees and contingencies for further information on the master lease 
further  comparative interest expense also reflects the benefits realized in associated with interest rate swaps 
in  we terminated an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million 
this swap was used to hedge a portion of outstanding promissory notes that were issued to lipa in connection with the keyspan lilco business combination 
in march  we redeemed approximately million of the outstanding promissory notes  and settled the outstanding derivative instrument 
the cash proceeds from the termination of the interest rate hedge were million  of which million represented accrued swap interest 
the difference between the termination settlement amount and the amount of accrued swap interest  million  was recorded to earnings as an adjustment to interest expense in and effectively offset a portion of the redemption charges 
offsetting  to some extent  these adverse impacts to comparative interest expense are the benefits associated with a lower level of outstanding long term debt 
as noted previously  during  keyspan redeemed approximately million of outstanding long term debt and recorded million in debt redemption costs 
in  keyspan incurred debt redemption costs of million associated with i the redemption of approximately million of outstanding promissory notes issued to lipa in connection with the keyspan lilco business combination  and ii houston exploration s debt redemption costs of million to retire million notes 
the operating results for houston exploration were consolidated in other income and deductions for also reflects a million gain recorded on the settlement of a derivative financial instrument entered into in connection with the sale leaseback transaction associated with the ravenswood expansion  as well as a million foreign currency gain on cash investments held off shore 
other income and deductions for also reflects severance tax refunds totaling million recorded by houston exploration for severance taxes paid in and earlier periods  as well as million of realized foreign currency translation gains 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  contractual obligations  financial guarantees and contingencies for additional information regarding the sale leaseback transaction 
income tax expense generally reflects the level of pre tax income 
in addition  tax expense for reflects i a million benefit resulting from a revised appraisal associated with property that was disposed of in  ii a tax benefit of million related to the repatriation of earnings from keyspan s foreign investments  and iii the beneficial tax treatment afforded the stock transaction with houston exploration 
income tax expense for includes a number of items impacting comparative results 
during  the partial monetization of our canadian investments resulted in tax expense of million  reflecting certain united states partnership tax rules 
in addition  we recorded an adjustment to income tax expense of million due to the commonwealth of massachusetts disallowing the carry forward of net operating losses incurred by our regulated utilities in massachusetts 
offsetting  to some extent  these increases to tax expense  was a tax benefit recorded in of million associated with certain new york city general corporation tax issues 
in addition  certain costs associated with employee deferred compensation plans were deducted for federal income tax purposes in these costs  however  are not expensed for book purposes resulting in a beneficial permanent book to tax difference of million 
as noted earlier  earnings available for common stock for the year ended december   also included losses of million  or per share  from discontinued operations 
earnings available for common stock for the year ended december   included a charge for a cumulative change in accounting principles of million  or per share  associated with the implementation of fin  as well as operating losses of million  or per share associated with discontinued operations 
as a result of the items discussed above  earnings available for common stock were million  or per share for the year ended december   compared to million  or per share realized in review of operating segments keyspan s segment results are reported on an operating income basis 
management believes that this generally accepted accounting principle gaap based measure provides a reasonable indication of keyspan s underlying performance associated with its operations 
the following is a discussion of financial results achieved by keyspan s operating segments presented on an operating income basis 
gas distribution keyspan energy delivery new york kedny provides gas distribution service to customers in the new york city boroughs of brooklyn  staten island and a portion of queens 
keyspan energy delivery long island kedli provides gas distribution service to customers in the long island counties of nassau and suffolk and the rockaway peninsula of queens county 
four natural gas distribution companies boston gas company  essex gas company  colonial gas company and energynorth natural gas  inc  each doing business under the name keyspan energy delivery new england kedne  provide gas distribution service to customers in massachusetts and new hampshire 
the table below highlights certain significant financial data and operating statistics for the gas distribution segment for the periods indicated 
year ended december  in millions of dollars revenues    cost of gas    revenue taxes net gas revenues    operating expenses operations and maintenance depreciation and amortization operating taxes total operating expenses    gain on the sale of property operating income firm gas sales and transportation mdth    transportation electric generation mdth    other sales mdth    warmer colder than normal new york long island warmer colder than normal new england a mdth is  therms and reflects the heating content of approximately one million cubic feet of gas 
a therm reflects the heating content of approximately cubic feet of gas 
one billion cubic feet bcf of gas equals approximately  mdth 
executive summary operating income vs operating income decreased million  or  for the twelve months ended december   compared to the same period last year due to higher operating expenses 
operating expenses increased million reflecting primarily an increase in the provision for uncollectible accounts receivable and higher property taxes totaling million 
partially offsetting the higher operating expenses was an increase of million in net gas revenues revenues less the cost of gas and associated revenue taxes resulting from customer additions and oil to gas conversions in our firm gas sales market  as well as from higher net gas revenues in our large volume heating markets 
net revenues net gas revenues from our gas distribution operations increased million  or  for the twelve months ended december   compared to the same period last year 
net gas revenues benefited from customer additions and oil to gas conversions in our firm gas sales market residential  commercial and industrial customers  as well as from higher net gas revenues in our large volume heating and interruptible non firm markets 
as measured in heating degree days  weather in in our new york and new england service territories was approximately and colder than normal  respectively 
compared to  weather in was colder in keyspan s new england service territory  while weather was consistent between years in the new york service territory 
net revenues from firm gas customers residential  commercial and industrial customers increased million for the twelve months ended december   compared to the same period last year 
customer additions and oil to gas conversions  net of attrition and conservation  added million to net gas revenues 
further  we realized a benefit of million as a result of the boston gas company s performance based rate plan the plan that was approved by the massachusetts department of telecommunications and energy madte in the plan provides for firm gas sales rates to be adjusted each year based on an inflation factor offset by a productivity factor 
see the caption under regulation and rate matters for further information regarding the rate filing 
offsetting  to some extent  the beneficial impact of the customer additions and oil to gas conversions was the adverse impact to comparative net gas revenues from the additional billing day last year due to the leap year 
in  keyspan realized million in additional net gas revenues from the additional billing day 
further  keyspan earned million less in regulatory incentives for the twelve months ended december   compared to the same period last year 
also included in net revenues is the recovery of certain regulatory items and certain taxes that added million to net revenues 
however  the recovery of these items through revenues does not impact net income since we expense a similar amount as amortization charges and income taxes  as appropriate on the consolidated statement of income 
firm gas distribution rates for kedny  kedli and kedne in  other than for the recovery of gas costs and as noted  have remained substantially unchanged from rates charged in kedny and kedli each operate under a utility tariff that contains a weather normalization adjustment that significantly offsets variations in firm net revenues due to fluctuations in normal weather 
however  the gas distribution operations of our new england based subsidiaries do not have a weather normalization adjustment 
to mitigate the effect of fluctuations in normal weather patterns on kedne s results of operations and cash flows  weather derivatives were in place for the and winter heating seasons 
these financial derivatives afforded keyspan some protection against warmer than normal weather 
as a result of the weather fluctuations and financial weather derivatives  weather had a million favorable impact on comparative net gas revenues 
see note to the consolidated financial statements hedging  derivative financial instruments and fair values for further information on derivative transactions 
in our large volume heating and interruptible non firm markets  which include large apartment houses  government buildings and schools  gas service is provided under rates that are designed to compete with prices of alternative fuel  including no 
and no 
grade heating oil 
these dual fuel customers can consume either natural gas or fuel oil for heating purposes 
net revenues in these markets increased million during the twelve months ended december   compared to the same period last year  primarily reflecting higher pricing 
further  since weather during january was significantly colder than normal  keyspan interrupted service to a segment of its dual fuel customers for a number of days during the month  as permitted under its tariff  to ensure reliable service to firm customers 
the majority of interruptible profits earned by kedli and kedne are returned to firm customers as an offset to gas costs 
firm sales  transportation and other sales quantities both actual firm gas sales and transportation quantities  as well as weather normalized sales quantities for the twelve months ended december   remained consistent with those quantities realized in net revenues are not affected by customers opting to purchase their gas supply from other sources  since delivery rates charged to transportation customers generally are the same as delivery rates charged to full sales service customers 
transportation quantities related to electric generation reflect the transportation of gas to our electric generating facilities located on long island 
net revenues from transportation services are not material 
other sales quantities include on system interruptible quantities  off system sales quantities sales made to customers outside of our service territories and related transportation 
the increase in these sales quantities for the twelve months ended december  compared to the same period of reflects higher off system sales 
the majority of these profits earned are returned to firm customers as an offset to gas costs 
from april  through march   we had an agreement with coral resources  lp coral  a subsidiary of shell oil company  under which coral assisted in the origination  structuring  valuation and execution of energy related transactions on behalf of kedny and kedli 
upon the expiration of this agreement  these services are provided by keyspan employees 
we also have a portfolio management contract with merrill lynch trading  under which merrill lynch trading provides all of the city gate supply requirements at market prices and manages certain upstream capacity  underground storage and term supply contracts for kedne 
a new three year agreement has been negotiated with merrill lynch to provide portfolio management services to keyspan s massachusetts gas distribution subsidiaries 
this agreement is pending madte approval 
keyspan will provide these services internally for its new hampshire gas distribution subsidiary  energynorth 
purchased gas for resale the increase in gas costs for the twelve months ended december   compared to the same period of  of million  or  reflects an increase of in the price per dekatherm of gas purchased for firm gas sales customers  as well as an increase in the quantity of gas purchased for large volume heating and interruptible non firm customers 
the current gas rate structure of each of our gas distribution utilities includes a gas adjustment clause  pursuant to which variations between actual gas costs incurred for resale to firm sales customers and gas costs billed to firm sales customers are deferred and refunded to or collected from customers in a subsequent period 
operating expenses for the twelve months ended december   operating expenses increased million  or compared to the same period last year 
operations and maintenance expense increased million  or  in compared to primarily due to an increase of million in the provision for uncollectible accounts as a result of increasing gas costs and the adverse impact from recent collection experience 
further  the gas distribution operations realized an increase in insurance and regulatory fees  as well as postretirement expenses in compared to in  keyspan recognized a benefit of approximately million  net of amounts subject to regulatory deferral treatment  associated with the implementation of the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of the medicare act and implementation of financial accounting standards board staff position fsp in addition  in  boston gas reached an agreement with an insurance carrier for recovery of previously incurred environmental expenditures 
insurance and third party recoveries  after deducting legal fees  are shared between boston gas and its firm gas customers as provided under a previously issued madte rate order 
as a result of this insurance settlement  boston gas recorded a million benefit to operations and maintenance expense 
comparative operating taxes increased million due to the expiration of a five year property tax assessment agreement with new york city  as well as to a million property tax refund received in higher depreciation charges of million reflecting the continued expansion of the gas distribution system were offset by lower regulatory amortization charges of million 
in december  boston gas received a madte order permitting regulatory recovery of the gas cost component of bad debt write offs 
this was approved for full recovery as an exogenous cost effective november  in addition  effective january   boston gas is permitted to fully recover the gas cost component of bad debt write offs through its cost of gas adjustment clause rather than filing for recovery as an exogenous cost 
we have reflected both of these favorable recovery mechanisms in our december  allowance for doubtful accounts reserve requirement and related expense 
boston gas also plans to request full recovery  as an exogenous cost  of the gas cost component of bad debt write offs beginning november  executive summary operating income vs operating income increased million for the twelve months ended december   compared to the same period last year  primarily due to an increase in net revenues of million resulting  for the most part  from the boston gas rate proceeding that was concluded in november partially offsetting the increase in net revenues were higher operating expenses of million  primarily due to an increase in the provision for uncollectible accounts receivable as a result of higher gas costs  as well as higher depreciation and amortization expenses 
it should be noted that during we recorded million in gains from property sales on long island 
net revenues net gas revenues revenues less the cost of gas and associated revenue taxes from our gas distribution operations increased by million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
net gas revenues benefited from the boston gas rate increase granted in the fourth quarter of  as well as from customer additions and oil to gas conversions 
as measured in heating degree days  weather in in our new york and new england service territories was approximately and colder than normal  respectively  compared to approximately and colder than normal in  respectively 
weather in was approximately warmer than in our new york service territory and approximately warmer than in our new england service territory 
net revenues from firm gas customers residential  commercial and industrial customers increased million for the twelve months ended december  compared to the same period of as previously mentioned  the madte approved a million base rate increase for boston gas  which became effective on november  for the twelve months ended december   the rate increase resulted in a benefit to net gas revenues of million 
see the caption under regulation and rate matters for further information regarding the rate filing 
customer additions and oil to gas conversions  net of attrition and conservation  added million to net gas revenues 
further  we realized a million benefit to net gas revenues as a result of an additional billing day in the leap year and million associated with regulatory incentives 
also included in net gas revenues is the recovery of property taxes that were million lower in compared to these revenues  however  do not impact net income since the taxes they are designed to recover are expensed on the consolidated statement of income 
firm gas distribution rates for kedny and kedli during  other than for the recovery of gas costs  have remained substantially unchanged from rates charged in kedny and kedli each operate under a utility tariff that contains a weather normalization adjustment that significantly offsets variations in firm net revenues due to fluctuations in normal weather 
however  the gas distribution operations of our new england based subsidiaries do not have a weather normalization adjustment 
to mitigate the effect of fluctuations in weather patterns on kedne s results of operations and cash flows  weather derivatives were in place for the and winter heating seasons 
these financial derivatives afforded keyspan some protection against warmer than normal weather 
as a result of weather fluctuations year to year  offset by the benefits of the financial weather derivatives  weather had a million unfavorable impact on comparative net gas revenues 
in our large volume heating and other interruptible non firm markets  which include large apartment houses  government buildings and schools  gas service is provided under rates that are designed to compete with prices of alternative fuel  including no 
and no 
grade heating oil 
these dual fuel customers can consume either natural gas or fuel oil for heating purposes 
net revenues in these markets increased million in compared to the majority of interruptible profits earned by kedli and kedne are returned to firm customers as an offset to gas costs 
firm sales  transportation and other sales quantities firm gas sales and transportation quantities for the year ended december   were approximately lower compared to such quantities for the same period in reflecting the warmer weather 
weather normalized sales quantities increased in our service territories during net revenues are not affected by customers opting to purchase their gas supply from other sources  since delivery rates charged to transportation customers generally are the same as delivery rates charged to full sales service customers 
transportation quantities related to electric generation reflect the transportation of gas to our electric generating facilities located on long island 
net revenues from these services are not material 
purchased gas for resale the increase in gas costs for the twelve months ended december   compared to the same period of of million  or  reflects an increase of in the price per dekatherm of gas purchased  and a decrease in the quantity of gas purchased 
the current gas rate structure of each of our gas distribution utilities includes a gas adjustment clause  pursuant to which variations between actual gas costs incurred for sale to firm customers and gas costs billed to firm customers are deferred and refunded to or collected from customers in a subsequent period 
operating expenses total operating expenses for the year ended december  increased million  or  compared to  reflecting higher operations and maintenance and depreciation expense 
operations and maintenance expense increased million  or  in compared to primarily due to an increase of million in the provision for uncollectible accounts receivable as a result of increasing gas costs  as well as higher employee welfare costs  primarily postretirement expenses of approximately million 
these increases to operations and maintenance expenses were partially offset by a benefit of million  net of amounts subject to regulatory deferral treatment  associated with the implementation of the medicare act and implementation of financial accounting standards board staff position fsp in addition  in  boston gas reached a settlement with an insurance carrier for recovery of previously incurred environmental expenditures 
insurance and third party recoveries  after deducting legal fees  are shared between boston gas and its firm gas customers under a previously issued madte rate order 
as a result of this insurance settlement  boston gas recorded a million benefit to operations and maintenance expense 
higher depreciation and amortization expense in reflects the continued expansion of the gas distribution system  while the lower operating taxes resulted primarily from a property tax refund in our new york service territory 
sale of property during we recorded million in gains from property sales  primarily the sale of acres of real property located on long island 
gas supply and pricing keyspan has adequate gas supply available to meet its gas load demand in its service territories for the winter heating season as keyspan s gas storage was full at the start of the winter heating season 
the current gas rate structure of each of our gas distribution utilities includes a gas adjustment clause  pursuant to which gas costs are recovered in billed sales to regulated firm gas sales customers 
although keyspan is allowed to pass through the cost of gas to its customers  management is concerned with the rising natural gas prices and the related impact on customers gas bills and recovery of customer accounts receivable 
as noted  keyspan has already experienced an increase in bad debt expense and an increase in collection lag 
also  it is likely that the high gas prices will lead to an increase in price elasticity possibly resulting in an increase in customer conservation measures and attrition 
the recent madte order permitting boston gas regulatory recovery of the gas cost component of net bad debt write offs should help to mitigate the increase in bad debt expense 
with our strategy of having keyspan s storage facilities full at the start of the heating season and our use of financial derivatives  keyspan has effectively hedged the price of approximately two thirds of the gas supply needed to serve its customers during the upcoming winter 
this helps mitigate the impact from rising natural gas prices on customers winter heating gas bills 
further  keyspan has programs in place to help customers manage their gas bills  such as balanced billing plans  deferred payment arrangements and the low income home energy assistance program  which we supported the expansion of through the energy act 
management believes that these measures will help mitigate the impact of rising gas prices on customers bills 
other matters we remain committed to our ongoing gas system expansion strategies 
we believe that significant growth opportunities exist on long island and in our new england service territories  as well as continued growth in the new york service territory  despite the rising gas prices 
we estimate that on long island approximately of the residential and multi family markets  and approximately of the commercial market  currently use natural gas for space heating 
further  we estimate that in our new england service territories approximately of the residential and multi family markets  as well as approximately of the commercial market  currently use natural gas for space heating purposes 
we will continue to seek growth  in all our market segments  through the expansion of our gas distribution system for new construction and to penetrate existing communities where no distribution system exists  as well as through the conversion of residential homes from oil to gas for space heating purposes where natural gas is already in the home for other uses and the pursuit of opportunities to grow multi family  industrial and commercial markets 
in order to serve the anticipated market requirements in our new york service territories  keyspan and duke energy corporation formed islander east pipeline company  llc islander east in once in service  the pipeline is expected to transport up to  dth of natural gas to the long island and new york city energy markets  enough natural gas to heat  homes 
in addition  during keyspan acquired a interest in the millennium pipeline development project which is anticipated to transport up to  dth of natural gas a day to the algonquin pipeline 
kedli has executed a precedent agreement for  dth of natural gas per day of transportation capacity from the millennium pipeline system  increasing to  dth in the third year of the pipeline being in service 
these pipeline projects will allow keyspan to diversify the geographic sources of its gas supply 
see the discussion under the caption energy investments for additional information regarding these pipeline projects 
electric services the electric services segment primarily consists of subsidiaries that own and operate oil and gas fired electric generating plants in the borough of queens including the ravenswood generating station which comprises the ravenswood facility and ravenswood expansion and the counties of nassau and suffolk on long island 
in addition  through long term contracts of varying lengths  we i provide to lipa all operation  maintenance and construction services and significant administrative services relating to the long island electric transmission and distribution t d system pursuant to a management services agreement the msa  ii supply lipa with electric generating capacity  energy conversion and ancillary services from our long island generating units pursuant to a power supply agreement the psa  and iii manage all aspects of the fuel supply for our long island generating facilities  as well as all aspects of the capacity and energy owned by or under contract to lipa pursuant to an energy management agreement the ema 
the msa  psa and ema all became effective on may  and are collectively referred to herein as the lipa agreements 
on february   keyspan and lipa entered into i an amended and restated management services agreement the msa  pursuant to which keyspan will continue to operate and maintain the electric t d system owned by lipa on long island  ii a new option and purchase and sale agreement the option agreement  to replace the generation purchase rights agreement as amended  the gpra  pursuant to which lipa had the option  through december   to effectively acquire substantially all of the electric generating facilities owned by keyspan on long island  and iii a settlement agreement the settlement agreement resolving outstanding issues between the parties regarding the lipa agreements 
the msa  the option agreement and the settlement agreement are collectively referred to herein as the lipa agreements

the electric services segment also provides retail marketing of electricity to commercial customers 
selected financial data for the electric services segment is set forth in the table below for the periods indicated 
year ended december  in millions of dollars revenues    purchased fuel net revenues    operating expenses operations and maintenance depreciation operating taxes total operating expenses gain on the sale of property operating income electric sales mwh    capacity mw    summer cooling degree days   reflects the operations of the ravenswood generating station only 
executive summary operating income vs for the twelve months ended december   operating income increased million  or  compared to last year  primarily due to an increase in net revenues from the ravenswood generating station of million mainly as a result of improved pricing  partially offset by an increase in operating expenses associated with the ravenswood generating station of million  as well as lower net revenues associated with keyspan s retail electric marketing activities of million 
net revenues total electric net revenues realized during the twelve months ended december   were million  or higher than such revenues realized during the corresponding period last year 
for the year ended december   net revenues from the ravenswood generating station increased million  or  compared to the same period last year reflecting higher energy margins of million  as well as increased capacity revenues of million 
the increase in capacity revenues reflects the operation of the ravenswood expansion which went into full commercial operation in may  as well as load growth in new york city 
the increase in energy margins for reflects an increase of in realized spark spreads the selling price of electricity less the cost of fuel  plus hedging gains or losses  as well as from an increase of in the level of megawatt hours mwh sold into the new york independent system operator nyiso energy market 
these favorable energy results were primarily driven by the pricing differential between number grade fuel oil and natural gas used in the ravenswood generating station in due to the dual fuel nature of the ravenswood generating station  keyspan was able to take advantage of their ability to switch to cheaper fuel as the gap between number grade fuel oil and gas prices spread during the latter part of the summer 
the two hurricanes which occurred this past summer in the gulf coast of the united states contributed to the gap between number grade fuel oil and natural gas prices 
further  in keyspan received million from the nyiso to settle billing issues regarding the sale of energy provided by the ravenswood generating station to the nyiso in may weather for  as measured in cooling degree days  was warmer than last year and warmer than normal 
we employ derivative financial hedging instruments to hedge the cash flow variability for a portion of forecasted purchases of natural gas and fuel oil consumed at the ravenswood generating station 
further  we have engaged in the use of derivative financial hedging instruments to hedge the cash flow variability associated with a portion of forecasted electric energy sales from the ravenswood generating station 
these derivative instruments resulted in hedging losses  which are reflected in net electric margins  of million in compared to hedging gains of million in the results derived from keyspan s hedging strategy are reflected in the calculation of realized spark spreads 
see note to the consolidated financial statements hedging  derivative financial instruments and fair values as well as item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for further information on keyspan s hedging strategies 
the rules and regulations for capacity  energy sales and the sale of certain ancillary services to the nyiso energy markets continue to evolve and there are several matters pending with the ferc 
see the discussion under the caption market and credit risk management activities for further details on these matters 
net revenues for the twelve months ended december   from the service agreements with lipa  including the power purchase agreements associated with two electric peaking facilities  increased million compared to the corresponding period of the increase is due  in part  to recovery of operating expenses billed to lipa of approximately million and the recovery of depreciation charges and property taxes of approximately million 
these recoveries had no impact on operating income since actual expenses increased by a like amount 
the remaining increase primarily reflects an increase in emission credits earned and variable revenues  which are a function of electric generation output 
in and we earned million associated with non cost performance incentives provided for under these agreements 
for a description of the lipa agreements and power purchase agreements  see the discussion under the caption electric services lipa agreements 
net revenues associated with keyspan s retail electric marketing activities decreased million in compared to  due to a significant curtailment in these activities 
keyspan has terminated all indexed price contracts and has elected to maintain only its fixed priced contracts 
as a result  the retail electric marketing business has approximately mw under contract 
operating expenses for the twelve months ended december   operating expenses increased million  or  compared to the same period last year 
operations and maintenance expense increased million  or over last year reflecting an increase of million in operating lease costs associated with our financing arrangement for the ravenswood expansion  as well as an increase in overhaul work and plant retirement costs associated with the ravenswood generating station amounting to approximately million 
the remaining increase reflects operating costs billed to lipa of approximately million 
depreciation expense and operating taxes increased million in compared to of this amount  approximately million is associated with keyspan s long island based electric generating units and are fully recoverable from lipa  as noted above 
the remaining increase in these line items is associated with the ravenswood generating station 
executive summary operating income vs operating income increased million for the twelve months ended december  compared to the same period in  due primarily to an increase in net revenues from the ravenswood generating station of million  partially offset by higher depreciation expense and operating taxes 
in addition  in  keyspan recognized a gain of million on the sale of a parcel of land in far rockaway  queens  to lipa 
net revenues total electric net revenues realized during were million  or higher than such revenues realized during this increase is primarily attributable to the operation of the ravenswood expansion 
net revenues from the ravenswood generating station increased million  or in compared to reflecting increased capacity revenues of million  as well as higher energy margins of million 
the increase in capacity revenues in  compared to primarily reflects the operation of the ravenswood expansion 
the increase in energy margins for the twelve months ended december   reflects a increase in the level of mwh s sold into the nyiso energy market  as well as an increase of in realized spark spreads 
the increase in energy sales quantities reflects the operations of the ravenswood expansion 
as measured in cooling degree days  weather during the peak summer months of was approximately warmer than  but cooler than normal 
further  energy sales quantities in were adversely impacted by the scheduled major overhaul of our largest electric generating unit 
as noted  we employ derivative financial hedging instruments to hedge the cash flow variability for a portion of forecasted purchases of natural gas and fuel oil consumed at the ravenswood generating station 
further  we have engaged in the use of derivative financial hedging instruments to hedge the cash flow variability associated with a portion of forecasted electric energy sales from the ravenswood generating station 
these derivative instruments resulted in hedging gains  which are reflected in net electric margins  of million in compared to hedging gains of million for the benefits derived from keyspan s hedging strategy contributed to an increase in realized spark spreads despite the cooler weather during the peak summer months 
net revenues from the service agreements with lipa  including the power purchase agreements associated with two electric peaking facilities  increased million for the twelve months ended december   compared to this increase reflects  in part  recovery from lipa of approximately million in higher property taxes and depreciation charges 
these recoveries had no impact on operating income since actual property taxes and depreciation charges increased by a like amount 
further  comparative revenues reflect adjustments to the cost recovery mechanism in the lipa service agreements to match actual costs incurred with recovery of such costs 
these adjustments reduced revenues in by approximately million compared to these adjustments to revenues had no impact on operating income since actual operating costs decreased by a like amount 
excluding these two items  net revenues from the service agreements with lipa decreased approximately million in  compared to  reflecting a lower level of off system sales and emission credits  both of which are shared with lipa 
in we earned million associated with non cost performance incentives provided for under these agreements  compared to million earned in in addition to the above  net revenues from our electric marketing activities were slightly lower in compared to operating expenses total operating expenses increased million  or  for the year ended december   compared to the same period of  due to higher operating taxes and depreciation charges  partially offset by lower operations and maintenance expenses 
operations and maintenance expense decreased million reflecting  in part  million in lower costs associated with the lipa service agreements as noted earlier 
operations and maintenance expense also reflects the impact of fin  which required keyspan to consolidate the ravenswood master lease and classify the lease obligation as long term debt on the consolidated balance sheet 
further  an asset was recorded on the consolidated balance sheet for an amount substantially equal to the fair market value of the leased assets at the inception of the lease  less depreciation since that date 
as a result of implementing fin  beginning january   lease payments associated with the ravenswood master lease have been reflected as interest expense on the consolidated statement of income and the leased assets are being depreciated 
the classification of lease payments associated with the ravenswood master lease to interest expense resulted in a comparative decrease to operations and maintenance expense of million 
however  keyspan incurred lease costs of million associated with the sale leaseback transaction involving the ravenswood expansion  that went into effect may in addition  keyspan incurred increased repair and maintenance costs  including removal costs  associated with the ravenswood generating station  as well as higher postretirement costs  which  for the most part  offset the beneficial impact of fin see note to the consolidated financial statements contractual obligations  financial guarantees and contingencies for an explanation of the ravenswood master lease 
the increase in depreciation expense of million primarily relates to the depreciation of the leased assets under the ravenswood master lease  which increased depreciation by million 
the remaining increase in depreciation expense is associated with keyspan s long island based electric generating units and is fully recoverable from lipa 
the higher operating taxes primarily reflect an increase in property taxes which are fully recoverable from lipa  as noted earlier 
other matters in  the new york state board on electric generation siting and the environment issued an opinion and order which granted a certificate of environmental capability and public need for a mw combined cycle electric generating facility in melville  long island  which is final and non appealable 
also in  lipa issued a request for proposal rfp seeking bids from developers to either build and operate a long island generating facility  and or a new cable that will link long island to power from a non long island source of between to mw of electricity by no later than the summer of keyspan filed a proposal in response to lipa s rfp 
in  lipa selected proposals submitted by two other bidders in response to the rfp 
keyspan remains committed to the melville project and the benefits to long island s energy future that this project would supply 
the project has received new york state article x approval by having met all operational and environmental permitting requirements 
further  the project is strategically located in close proximity to both the high voltage power transmission grid and the high pressure gas distribution network 
in addition  given the intense public pressure to reduce emissions from existing generating facilities  development of the melville project is possible as a means to virtually re power older  less efficient generating units 
specifically  keyspan believes that it would be able to reduce emissions on long island in a cost effective manner by developing the melville project and retiring an older  less efficient generating facility 
we have begun discussions with lipa regarding this proposal 
at december   total capitalized costs associated with the siting  permitting and procurement of equipment for the melville facility were million 
in march  lipa issued a rfp to provide system power supply management services beginning may  and fuel management services for certain of its peaking generating units beginning january  a keyspan subsidiary is currently performing these services 
keyspan submitted a bid in response to the new rfp in april lipa was scheduled to select a service provider in june  but has deferred such decision at this time 
pending lipa s determination on the rfp  the service agreements between keyspan and lipa which provide for these services have been extended to december  we cannot predict the outcome or the timing of any decisions by lipa on this matter at this time 
also  in march  the new york power authority nypa issued a rfp for long term new york city capacity and energy to meet the needs of its customers at prices that are economical  stable and predictable over the long run 
in june  keyspan submitted a non binding bid in response to nypa s rfp in which we proposed to construct a mw  combined cycle  natural gas fired power plant to be located in new york city  which could provide energy and capacity to nypa 
the proposed facility could be in commercial operation by june we cannot predict the outcome or the timing of any decisions by nypa on this matter at this time 
as part of our growth strategy  we continually evaluate the possible acquisition and development of additional generating facilities in the northeast  as well as other assets to complement our core operations 
however  we are unable to predict when or if any such facilities will be acquired and the effect any such acquired facilities will have on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
currently  the nyiso s new york city local reliability rules require that of the electric capacity needs of new york city be provided by in city generators 
on february   the nyiso operating committee increased the in city generator requirement to beginning in may through the period ending on april  based in part on the statewide reserve margin of set by the new york state reliability council 
on february  an appeal was filed with the nyiso management committee requesting that the february th decision be rejected and that the in city requirement be increased to a larger percentage than 
a vote on this appeal is expected to occur at the nyiso management committee meeting scheduled for february  our ravenswood generating station is an in city generator 
as the electric infrastructure in new york city and the surrounding areas continues to change and evolve and the demand for electric power increases  the in city generator requirement could be further modified 
construction of new transmission and generation facilities may cause significant changes to the market for sales of capacity  energy and ancillary services from our ravenswood generating station 
recently mw of capacity came on line and it is anticipated that another mw of new capacity may be available during as a result of the completion of an in city generation project currently under construction 
we can not  however  be certain as to when the new power plant will be in operation or the nature of future new york city energy  capacity or ancillary services market requirements or design 
keyspan continues to believe that new york city represents a strong capacity market and has entered into an international swap dealers association isda master agreement for a fixed for float unforced capacity financial swap the swap agreement with morgan stanley capital group inc morgan stanley dated as of january  the swap agreement has a three year term beginning may   assuming a condition to effectiveness has been satisfied by such date 
the notional quantity is  kw the notional quantity of in city unforced capacity and the fixed price is kw month fixed price  subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events 
settlement would occur on a monthly basis based on the in city unforced capacity price determined by the relevant new york independent system operator spot demand curve auction market floating price 
for each monthly settlement period  the price difference will equal the fixed price minus the floating price 
if such price difference is less than zero  morgan stanley will pay keyspan an amount equal to the product of a the notional quantity and b the absolute value of such price difference 
conversely  if such price difference is greater than zero  keyspan will pay morgan stanley an amount equal to the product of a the notional quantity and b the absolute value of such price difference 
energy services the energy services segment includes companies that provide energy related services to customers located primarily within the northeastern united states 
subsidiaries in this segment provide residential and small commercial customers with service and maintenance of energy systems and appliances  as well as operation and maintenance  design  engineering  consulting and fiber optic services to commercial  institutional and industrial customers 
in january and february of  keyspan sold its mechanical contracting subsidiaries in this segment and exited such businesses 
in the fourth quarter of  keyspan s investment in its discontinued mechanical contracting subsidiaries was written down to an estimated fair value 
in  operating losses were incurred through the dates of sale of these companies of million after tax  including  but not limited to  costs incurred for employee related benefits 
partially offsetting these losses was an after tax gain of million associated with the related divestitures  reflecting the difference between the fair value estimates and the financial impact of the actual sale transactions 
the net income impact of the operating losses and the disposal gain was a loss of million  or per share in see note to the consolidated financial statements business segments for additional details on the sale of the mechanical companies 
the table below highlights selected financial information for the energy services segment 
year ended december  in millions of dollars revenues less operating expenses goodwill impairment operating loss operating income vs the energy services segment incurred an operating loss of million in  compared to a loss of million in in  keyspan recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge in continuing operations of million as a result of an evaluation of the carrying value of goodwill recorded in this segment 
that evaluation resulted in a total pre tax impairment charge of million million  or per share after tax million of this charge is attributable to continuing operations  while the remaining million million after tax  or per share  was reflected in discontinued operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements energy services discontinued operations for additional details on this charge 
for  the improved performance over last year  excluding the goodwill impairment charge  primarily reflects a reduction in operating expenses 
in  charges associated with the write off of accounts receivable and contract revenues on certain projects that were determined to be uncollectible  were incurred as well as the write down of inventory balances 
further  this segment experienced an increase in gross profit margins and generally lower administrative costs in operating income vs the energy services segment incurred operating losses of million for the year ended december  compared to losses of million for the same period last year 
as noted  in keyspan recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge in continuing operations of million 
excluding the goodwill impairment charge  operating income for the twelve months ended december   was essentially the same as  as higher revenues were offset by higher operating expenses 
energy investments the energy investments segment consists of our gas exploration and production investments  as well as certain other domestic energy related investments 
keyspan s gas exploration and production activities include its wholly owned subsidiaries seneca upshur petroleum  inc seneca upshur and keyspan exploration and production  llc keyspan exploration 
seneca upshur is engaged in gas exploration and production activities primarily in west virginia 
keyspan exploration is primarily engaged in a joint venture with houston exploration 
this segment is also engaged in pipeline development activities 
keyspan and duke energy corporation each own a interest in islander east 
islander east was created to pursue the authorization and construction of an interstate pipeline from connecticut  across long island sound  to a terminus near shoreham  long island 
further  keyspan has a interest in the millennium pipeline project which is expected to transport up to  dth of natural gas a day from corning to ramapo  new york  where it will connect to an existing pipeline 
additionally  subsidiaries in this segment hold a equity interest in the iroquois gas transmission system lp  a pipeline that transports canadian gas supply to markets in the northeastern united states 
these subsidiaries are accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
accordingly  equity income from these investments is reflected as a component of operating income in the consolidated statement of income 
keyspan also owns a  barrel liquefied natural gas lng storage and receiving facility in providence  rhode island  through its wholly owned subsidiary keyspan lng  the operations of which are fully consolidated 
keyspan lng is re evaluating its plans to upgrade its lng facility in providence  rhode island in light of the ferc decision that denied keyspan lng s application for ferc authorization to expand the facility to accept marine deliveries and triple vaporization capacity 
during the first quarter of  we also had an approximate investment in certain midstream natural gas assets in western canada through keyspan canada 
these assets included processing plants and associated gathering systems that produced approximately bcfe of natural gas daily and provided associated natural gas liquids fractionation 
these operations were fully consolidated in keyspan s consolidated financial statements 
on april   keyspan and keyspan facilities income fund the fund  an open ended income trust which previously owned a interest in keyspan canada  consummated a transaction that reduced keyspan s ownership interest in keyspan canada to 
the transaction resulted in a gain of million million after tax  or per share 
effective april  keyspan canada s earnings and our ownership interest in keyspan canada were accounted for on the equity method of accounting 
in july  the fund issued an additional million units  the proceeds of which were used to fund the acquisition of the midstream assets of chevron canada midstream inc this transaction had the effect of further diluting keyspan s ownership of keyspan canada to 
in december  keyspan sold its remaining interest in keyspan canada to the fund and received net proceeds of approximately million and recorded a pre tax gain of million  which is reflected in other income and deductions on the consolidated statement of income 
the after tax gain was approximately million  or per share 
see note to the consolidated financial statements business segments for additional details regarding this transaction 
asset transactions regarding our investment in keyspan canada were also recorded in in  we sold a portion of our interest in keyspan canada through the fund 
the fund acquired a ownership interest in keyspan canada through an indirect subsidiary  and then issued million trust units to the public through an initial public offering 
each trust unit represented a beneficial interest in the fund 
additionally  we sold our interest in taylor ngl lp that owned and operated two extraction plants also in canada to altagas services  inc net proceeds of million from the two sales  plus proceeds of million drawn under a new credit facility made available to keyspan canada  were used to pay down existing keyspan canada credit facilities of million 
a pre tax loss of million was recognized on the transactions and was included in other income and deductions on the consolidated statement of income 
these transactions produced a tax expense of million as a result of certain united states partnership tax rules and resulted in an after tax loss of million 
in the first quarter of  keyspan sold its interest in premier  a gas pipeline from southwest scotland to northern ireland pursuant to a share sale and purchase agreement with bg energy holdings limited and premier transmission financing public limited company ptfpl  under which all of the outstanding shares of premier were to be purchased by ptfpl 
on march   the sale was completed and generated cash proceeds of million 
in the fourth quarter of  keyspan recorded a pre tax non cash impairment charge of million reflecting the difference between the anticipated cash proceeds from the sale of premier compared to its carrying value 
the final sale of premier resulted in a pre tax gain of million reflecting the difference from earlier estimates 
this gain was recorded in other income and deductions on the consolidated statement of income 
in the fourth quarter of  we completed the sale of our then interest in phoenix natural gas limited for million and recorded a pre tax gain of million in other income and deductions on the consolidated statement of income 
selected financial data and operating statistics for these energy related investments are set forth in the following table for the periods indicated 
these results exclude the results of houston exploration 
year ended december  in millions of dollars revenues less operation and maintenance expense ceiling test write down impairment charge other operating expenses add equity earnings sale of assets operating income loss operating income above reflects of keyspan canada s results from january  through april  operating income vs for the twelve months ended december   operating income for this segment increased million compared to the same period of  reflecting non cash impairment charges recorded last year of million 
as noted earlier  in  keyspan s wholly owned gas exploration and production subsidiaries that have remained with keyspan after the houston exploration transaction  recorded a non cash impairment charge of million to recognize the reduced valuation of proved reserves 
see note to the consolidated financial statements summary of significant accounting policies item f gas exploration and production property depletion for further information on this charge 
further  in the fourth quarter of  keyspan recorded a pre tax non cash impairment charge of million reflecting the difference between the anticipated cash proceeds from the sale of premier compared to its carrying value 
operating income for the twelve months ended december   also includes million in earnings from keyspan canada 
the remaining activities reflected a decrease in operating income of million primarily due to the sale of real property in operating income vs the decrease in comparative operating income in compared to of million reflects the impairment charges recorded in  as well as our lower ownership interest in keyspan canada 
operating income for the twelve months ended december   includes million in earnings from keyspan canada compared to operating income of million for the twelve months ended december  excluding the impairment charges and keyspan canada  the remaining activities reflected an increase in operating income of million primarily due to the sale of real property in  higher earnings from gas pipeline investments and lower administrative costs 
during the first five months of  our gas exploration and production investments also included a equity interest in houston exploration  the operations of which were consolidated in keyspan s consolidated financial statements 
on june   keyspan exchanged million shares of common stock of houston exploration for of the stock of seneca upshur  previously a wholly owned subsidiary of houston exploration 
this transaction reduced our interest in houston exploration from to the then current level of 
effective june   houston exploration s earnings and our ownership interest in houston exploration were accounted for on the equity method of accounting 
keyspan follows an accounting policy of income statement recognition for parent company gains or losses from common stock transactions initiated by its subsidiaries 
as a result  this transaction resulted in a gain to keyspan of million 
the deconsolidation of houston exploration required the recognition of certain deferred taxes on our remaining investment resulting in a net deferred tax expense of million 
therefore  the net gain on the share exchange less the deferred tax provision was million  or per share 
in november  keyspan sold its remaining interest in houston exploration million shares and received cash proceeds of approximately million 
keyspan recorded a pre tax gain of million which is reflected in other income and deductions on the consolidated statement of income 
the after tax gain was million or per share 
asset transactions regarding our investment in houston exploration were also recorded in in february  we reduced our ownership interest in houston exploration from to approximately following the repurchase  by houston exploration  of three million shares of common stock owned by keyspan 
we realized net proceeds of million in connection with this repurchase 
keyspan realized a gain of million on this transaction  which is reflected in other income and deductions on the consolidated statement of income 
income taxes were not provided  since this transaction was structured as a return of capital 
selected financial data and operating statistics for houston exploration for and are set forth in the following table 
year ended december  in millions of dollars revenues depletion and amortization expense other operating expenses add equity earnings operating income houston exploration operating income vs the decline in operating income of million for the twelve months ended december   compared to the corresponding period in  reflects the reduction in keyspan s ownership interest in houston exploration 
as noted  in keyspan maintained a ownership interest in houston exploration 
in  keyspan maintained a ownership interest for the five month period january  through june   then held an approximate interest for the five month period june  through october  keyspan then sold its remaining interest in houston exploration in november other matters in order to serve the anticipated market requirements in our new york service territories  keyspan and duke energy corporation formed islander east pipeline company  llc islander east in islander east is owned by keyspan and by duke energy  and was created to pursue the authorization and construction of an interstate pipeline from connecticut  across long island sound  to a terminus near shoreham  long island 
applications for all necessary regulatory authorizations were filed in and islander east has received a final certificate from the ferc and all necessary permits from the state of new york 
the state of connecticut denied islander east s request for a consistency determination under the coastal zone management act czma and application for a permit under section of the clean water act 
islander east appealed the state of connecticut s determination on the czma issue to the united states department of commerce 
in  the department of commerce overrode connecticut s denial and granted the czma authorization 
islander east s petition for a declaratory order overriding the denial of the clean water act permit is pending with connecticut s state superior court 
pursuant to a provision of the energy act  islander east has appealed the denial of the clean water act permit directly to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit and has moved to stay the connecticut case pending the second circuit s decision 
the state of connecticut has filed a motion to challenge the constitutionality of the provisions of the energy act providing this appeal right 
the appeal was argued in january and a decision is expected within the first six months of various options for the financing of this pipeline construction are being evaluated 
as of december   keyspan s total capitalized costs associated with the siting and permitting of the islander east pipeline were approximately million 
keyspan also owns a ownership interest in the millennium pipeline project 
keyspan acquired its interest in the project from duke energy in august the other partners in the millennium pipeline are columbia gas transmission corp  a unit of nisource incorporated and dte energy 
it is anticipated that keyspan will acquire an additional ownership interest in millennium from columbia during the first quarter of  bringing our total ownership interest in millennium to 
the millennium pipeline project is anticipated to transport up to  dth of natural gas a day from corning to ramapo  new york  interconnecting with the pipeline systems of various other utilities in new york 
the project received a ferc certificate to construct  acquire and operate the facilities in on august   the project filed an amended application with ferc requesting  among other things  approval of a reduction in capacity and maximum allowable operating pressure  minor route modifications  the addition of certain facilities and the acquisition of certain facilities from columbia gas transmission corporation 
additionally  in december  the consolidated edison company of new york con edison  kedli and columbia gas transmission each entered into amended precedent agreements to purchase capacity on the pipeline 
kedli has agreed to purchase  dth per day from the millennium pipeline system  increasing to  dth in the third year of the pipeline being in service 
this will provide kedli with new  competitively priced supplies of natural gas from canada 
subject to  among other things  the conditions precedent in the precedent agreements  the receipt of necessary regulatory approvals and financing  it is anticipated that construction on the millennium pipeline will be in service in either or as of december   total capitalized costs associated with the millennium pipeline project were million 
in  keyspan lng entered into a joint development agreement with bg  lng services  a subsidiary of british gas  to upgrade keyspan lng s liquidfied natural gas lng facility to accept marine deliveries and to triple vaporization or regasification capacity 
in june  the ferc denied keyspan lng s application to expand the facility citing concerns that the proposed upgraded facility would not meet current federal safety standards  which the facility is not currently subject to 
keyspan sought a rehearing with ferc  and on january  the ferc denied such request  although the order provided that keyspan lng could file an amendment to its original application addressing a revised expansion project which would differ substantially from that originally proposed by keyspan 
any amendment application would need to include a detailed analysis of the new project scope  including upgrades to the existing facilities and alternative plans for any service disruptions that may be necessary during construction of a new expanded project 
keyspan is evaluating whether to appeal ferc s current order 
in addition to the proceeding at ferc  keyspan lng also is involved in seeking other required regulatory approvals and the resolution of certain litigation regarding such approvals 
in february  keyspan lng filed an action in federal district court in rhode island seeking a declaratory judgment that it is not required to obtain a category b assent from the state of rhode island and an injunction preventing the rhode island coastal resources management council crmc from enforcing the category b assent requirements 
in march  the rhode island attorney general answered the complaint and moved to substitute the state of rhode island as the defendant and filed a counterclaim seeking a declaratory judgment that the expansion requires a category b assent 
in april  the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment with respect to all issues presented to the court 
on april   the attorney general also filed on behalf of the state a complaint against keyspan lng in rhode island state superior court raising substantially the same issues as the federal court action 
keyspan lng removed that action to federal court and moved for summary judgment 
the attorney general subsequently withdrew both the motion to substitute defendants and the counterclaim 
although the court had indicated its intention to issue a decision in the pending cases by august  the court has now indicated that it will stay the litigation pending resolution of the ferc rehearing and or appeal process discussed above 
since the ferc order is a recent development  the court has not yet taken any action 
as of december   our investment in this project was million 
allocated costs as previously noted  at december  keyspan was a holding company under puhca as a result of the energy act  puhca was repealed and replaced by puhca as of february  under puhca  the sec had jurisdiction over our holding company activities  including the regulation of our affiliate transactions and service companies 
in accordance with those regulations and state regulatory agencies regulations  we established service companies that provide i traditional corporate and administrative services  ii gas and electric transmission and distribution system planning  marketing  and gas supply planning and procurement  and iii engineering and surveying services to subsidiaries 
the sec s jurisdiction over our holding company activities was eliminated under puhca  although the sec continues to have jurisdiction over the registration and issuance of our securities under the securities law 
these service companies are now subject to the jurisdiction of the ferc under puhca  as well as subject to regulations and orders of the nypsc  madte and nhpuc 
see regulation and rate matters for additional information on the energy act 
the operating income variation as reflected in elimination and other is due primarily to costs residing at keyspan s holding company level such as corporate advertising and strategic review costs 
further  in keyspan reached a settlement with its insurance carriers regarding cost recovery for expenses incurred at a non utility environmental site and recorded an million gain from the settlement as a reduction to operating expenses 
operating income variations in eliminations and other between and reflect  in part  allocation adjustments recorded in as required by the sec  during we adjusted certain provisions in our allocation methodology that resulted in certain costs being allocated back to certain non operating subsidiaries 
further  as noted  in keyspan recorded an million gain from the settlement with its insurance carriers regarding cost recovery for expenses incurred at a non utility environmental site 
it should be noted that in keyspan recorded a million favorable adjustment for environmental reserves associated with non utility environmental sites based on a site investigation study concluded in the fourth quarter of liquidity cash flow from operations decreased million  or  for the twelve months ended december  compared to  reflecting  in part  the absence of houston exploration and keyspan canada which combined contributed approximately million to consolidated operating cash flow in it should be noted that in prior years  houston exploration funded its gas exploration and development activities  in part  from available cash flow from operations 
in addition  due to the significant increase in natural gas prices in  keyspan s gas distribution utilities paid approximately million more in compared to for the purchase of natural gas that is currently in inventory 
as noted previously  the current gas rate structure of each of our gas distribution utilities includes a gas adjustment clause  pursuant to which variations between actual gas costs incurred for sale to firm customers and gas costs billed to firm customers are deferred and refunded to or collected from customers in a subsequent period 
further in the internal revenue service irs published new regulations related to the capitalization of costs of self constructed property for income tax purposes 
as a result of these regulations  keyspan incurred approximately million in higher income tax payments for the twelve months ended december  compared to the same period in these adverse impacts to cash flow from operations were partially offset by lower interest payments and higher core earnings 
cash flow from operations for the year ended december  decreased million  or  compared to primarily due to federal tax refunds received in during  keyspan performed an analysis of costs capitalized for self constructed property and inventory for income tax purposes 
keyspan filed a change of accounting method for income tax purposes resulting in a cumulative deduction for costs previously capitalized 
as a result of this tax method change  along with accelerated deductions resulting from bonus depreciation  keyspan received in october  a million refund from the internal revenue service for prior year taxes  as well as an additional million for tax payments made in on a comparative basis  tax refunds received in compared with federal tax payments made in of million  resulted in a comparative cash flow decrease in of approximately million 
further  cash flow from operations for was adversely impacted by the deconsolidation of houston exploration in june at december   we had cash and temporary cash investments of million 
during the twelve months ended december   we repaid million of commercial paper and  at december   million of commercial paper was outstanding at a weighted average annualized interest rate of 
at december   keyspan had the ability to issue up to an additional million of short term debt under its commercial paper program 
in june  keyspan closed on a million revolving credit facility for five years due june   which was syndicated among fifteen banks  and an amended million revolving credit facility due june  these facilities replaced an existing million  year facility due june  and a year million facility due june the two credit facilities  which now total billion million for five years through  and million for the amended facility through  will continue to support keyspan s commercial paper program for ongoing working capital needs 
the fees for the facilities are based on keyspan s current credit ratings and are increased or decreased based on a downgrading or upgrading of our ratings 
the current annual facility fee is based on our credit rating of a by moody s investor services and a by standard poor s for each facility 
both credit facilities allow for keyspan to borrow using several different types of loans  specifically  eurodollar loans  abr loans  or competitively bid loans 
eurodollar loans are based on the eurodollar rate plus a margin that is tied to our applicable credit ratings 
abr loans are based on the higher of the prime rate  the base cd rate plus  or the federal funds effective rate plus 
competitive bid loans are based on bid results requested by keyspan from the lenders 
we do not anticipate borrowing against these facilities  however  if the credit rating on our commercial paper program were to be downgraded  it may be necessary to do so 
the facilities contain certain affirmative and negative operating covenants  including restrictions on keyspan s ability to mortgage  pledge  encumber or otherwise subject its utility property to any lien  as well as certain financial covenants that require us to  among other things  maintain a consolidated indebtedness to consolidated capitalization ratio of no more than as at the last day of any fiscal quarter 
violation of these covenants could result in the termination of the facilities and the required repayment of amounts borrowed thereunder  as well as possible cross defaults under other debt agreements 
at december   keyspan s consolidated indebtedness was of its consolidated capitalization and keyspan was in compliance with all covenants 
subject to certain conditions set forth in the credit facility  keyspan has the right  at any time  to increase the commitments under the million facility up to an additional million 
in addition  keyspan has the right to request that the termination date be extended for an additional period of days prior to each anniversary of the closing date 
this extension option  however  requires the approval of lenders holding more than of the total commitments to such extension request 
under the agreements  keyspan has the ability to replace non consenting lenders with other pre approved banks or financial institutions 
upon effectiveness of puhca  keyspan s ability to issue commercial paper is no longer limited by the sec 
accordingly  subject to compliance with the foregoing conditions  keyspan is currently able to issue up to billion of commercial paper 
a substantial portion of consolidated revenues are derived from the operations of businesses within the electric services segment  that are largely dependent upon two large customers lipa and the nyiso 
accordingly  our cash flows are dependent upon the timely payment of amounts owed to us by these counterparties 
see the discussion under the caption electric services lipa agreements for information regarding the recent settlement between keyspan and lipa regarding the current contractual agreements 
we satisfy our seasonal working capital requirements primarily through internally generated funds and the issuance of commercial paper 
we believe that these sources of funds are sufficient to meet our seasonal working capital needs 
capital expenditures and financing construction expenditures the table below sets forth our construction expenditures by operating segment for the periods indicated year ended december  in millions of dollars gas distribution electric services energy investments energy services and other construction expenditures related to the gas distribution segment are primarily for the renewal  replacement and expansion of the distribution system 
construction expenditures for the electric services segment reflect costs to maintain our generating facilities and  for  expand the ravenswood generating station 
construction expenditures related to the energy investments segment for primarily reflect costs associated with gas exploration and production activities of houston exploration  as well as costs related to keyspan canada s gas processing facilities 
construction expenditures for are estimated to be approximately million 
the amount of future construction expenditures is reviewed on an ongoing basis and can be affected by timing  scope and changes in investment opportunities 
financing in january  the nypsc issued orders granting additional financing authority to kedny and kedli 
kedny has the authority  through december   to issue up to million of new securities and to refinance up to million of its existing debt obligations 
kedli has the authority  through december   to issue up to million of new securities and to refinance up to million of its existing debt obligations 
kedny and kedli had sought a waiver from the requirement in the existing rate plans that kedny and kedli must raise their own long term debt or preferred stock and may not derive such securities from keyspan 
the nypsc declined to grant the requested waiver 
in december  kedny converted million of fixed rate gas facility revenue bonds gfrb gfrb series d and d due into variable rate debt 
the interest rate on these bonds is now reset  through an auction process  every seven days 
in november  kedny  issued million of tax exempt gfrb through the new york state energy research and development authority nyserda in the following series i million of gfrb  series a the series a bonds  and ii million gfrb  series b the series b bonds 
the interest rate on the series b bonds is reset every seven days through an auction process 
kedny used the proceeds from this issuance to redeem the following three series i million adjustable rate gfrb series a due february  ii million adjustable rate gfrb series b due february  and iii million gfrb series c due june kedny incurred million in call premiums and financing fees  all of which have been deferred for future rate recovery 
in january  keyspan redeemed million of outstanding debt notes due keyspan incurred million in call premiums and wrote off million of previously deferred costs 
further  we accelerated the amortization of approximately million of previously unamortized benefits associated with an interest rate swap on these bonds 
the accelerated amortization  as well as the write off of previously deferred costs was recorded to interest expense 
in addition  during the first quarter of  million of notes of a keyspan subsidiary were redeemed at maturity 
further  million of series b preferred stock was redeemed in may on its scheduled redemption date 
additionally  also in may  keyspan called for optional redemption million of series c of preferred stock due keyspan no longer has preferred stock outstanding 
in may  keyspan issued million meds equity units which were subject to conversion to common stock upon execution of the three year forward purchase contract 
in  keyspan was required to remarket the note component of the equity units between february and may and reset the interest rate to the then current market rate of interest  however  the reset interest rate could not be set below 
in march  keyspan remarketed the note component of million of the equity units at the reset interest rate of through their maturity date of may the balance of the notes million were held by the original meds equity unit holders in accordance with their terms and not remarketed 
keyspan then exchanged million of the remarketed notes for million of new year notes bearing an interest rate of 
therefore  keyspan now has million of notes outstanding with a maturity date of may and million of notes outstanding with a maturity date of april on may   keyspan issued million shares of common stock  at an issuance price of per share pursuant to the terms of the forward purchase contract 
keyspan received proceeds of approximately million from the equity issuance 
the number of shares issued was dependent on the average closing price of our common stock over the day trading period ending on the third trading day prior to may  the following table represents the ratings of our long term debt at december  during the fourth quarter of standard poor s reaffirmed its ratings on keyspan s and its subsidiaries long term debt and removed its negative outlook

the medium term notes  the master lease and the tax exempt bonds are reflected on the consolidated balance sheet  the sale leaseback obligation is not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet 
further  keyspan has guaranteed i up to million of surety bonds associated with certain construction projects currently being performed by current and former subsidiaries  ii certain supply contracts  margin accounts and purchase orders for certain subsidiaries in an aggregate amount of million  and iii million of subsidiary letters of credit 
these guarantees are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet 
keyspan s guarantees on certain performance bonds relating to current construction projects of the discontinued mechanical contracting companies will remain in place throughout the construction period for these projects 
keyspan has received an indemnity bond issued by a third party to offset potential exposure related to a significant portion of the continuing guarantee 
at this time  we have no reason to believe that our subsidiaries or former subsidiaries will default on their current obligations 
however  we cannot predict when or if any defaults may take place or the impact such defaults may have on our consolidated results of operations  financial condition or cash flows

discussion of critical accounting policies and assumptions in preparing our financial statements  the application of certain accounting policies requires difficult  subjective and or complex judgments 
the circumstances that make these judgments difficult  subjective and or complex have to do with the need to make estimates about the impact of matters that are inherently uncertain 
actual effects on our financial position and results of operations may vary significantly from expected results if the judgments and assumptions underlying the estimates prove to be inaccurate 
the critical accounting policies requiring such subjectivity are discussed below 
keyspan continually evaluates its critical accounting policies 
based upon current facts and circumstances keyspan has decided that certain accounting policies that were considered critical at december  should no longer be considered as critical accounting policies 
the accounting policies that are no longer considered critical are as follows i percentage of completion accounting is a method of accounting for long term construction type contracts in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
this accounting policy was used for engineering and mechanical contracting revenue recognition by the energy services segment 
however  since keyspan has sold its mechanical contracting subsidiaries  contracting revenue recognition is no longer a significant accounting issue  and ii the full cost accounting method is used by our gas exploration and production subsidiaries to account for their natural gas and oil properties 
seneca upshur and keyspan exploration continue to apply this accounting treatment 
however  since keyspan has sold its ownership interest in houston exploration  keyspan s gas exploration and production activities are not a significant aspect of its overall business operations and therefore  full cost accounting is no longer a significant accounting policy 
valuation of goodwill keyspan records goodwill on purchase transactions  representing the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of net assets acquired 
in testing for goodwill impairment under sfas goodwill and other intangible assets  significant reliance is placed upon a number of estimates regarding future performance that require broad assumptions and significant judgment by management 
a change in the fair value of our investments could cause a significant change in the carrying value of goodwill 
the assumptions used to measure the fair value of our investments are the same as those used by us to prepare annual operating segment and consolidated earnings and cash flow forecasts 
in addition  these assumptions are used to set annual budgetary guidelines 
as prescribed in sfas  keyspan is required to compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
this evaluation is required to be performed at least annually  unless facts and circumstances indicated that the evaluation should be performed at an interim period during the year 
at december   keyspan had billion of recorded goodwill and has concluded that the fair value of the business units that have recorded goodwill exceed their carrying value 
as noted previously  during  keyspan conducted an evaluation of the carrying value of goodwill recorded in its energy services segment 
as a result of this evaluation  keyspan recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million million after tax  or per share in this charge was recorded as follows i million as an operating expense on the consolidated statement of income reflecting the write down of goodwill on energy services segment s continuing operations  and ii million as discontinued operations reflecting the impairment on the mechanical contracting companies 
see note to the consolidated financial statements energy services discontinued operations for further details 
also as noted previously  at the end of  keyspan anticipated selling its then interest in premier 
this investment was accounted for under the equity method of accounting in the energy investments segment 
in the fourth quarter of keyspan recorded a pre tax non cash impairment charge of million million after tax or per share 
the impairment charge reflected the difference between the anticipated cash proceeds from the sale of premier compared to its carrying value at that time and was recorded as a reduction to goodwill 
accounting for the effects of rate regulation on gas distribution operations the financial statements of the gas distribution segment reflect the ratemaking policies and orders of the new york public service commission nypsc  the new hampshire public utilities commission nhpuc  and the massachusetts department of telecommunications and energy madte 
four of our six regulated gas utilities kedny  kedli  boston gas and energynorth are subject to the provisions of sfas  accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation 
this statement recognizes the actions of regulators  through the ratemaking process  to create future economic benefits and obligations affecting rate regulated companies 
in separate orders issued by the madte relating to the acquisition by eastern enterprises of colonial gas and essex gas  the base rates charged by these companies have been frozen at their current levels for a ten year period ending due to the length of these base rate freezes  colonial gas and essex gas had previously discontinued the application of sfas energynorth base rates continue as set by the nhpuc in sfas allows for the deferral of expenses and income on the consolidated balance sheet as regulatory assets and liabilities when it is probable that those expenses and income will be allowed in the rate setting process in a period different from the period in which they would have been reflected in the consolidated statements of income of an unregulated company 
these deferred regulatory assets and liabilities are then recognized in the consolidated statement of income in the period in which the amounts are reflected in rates 
in the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for us to recover costs in the future  all or a portion of our regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of sfas in that event  a write down of our existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result 
if we were unable to continue to apply the provisions of sfas for any of our rate regulated subsidiaries  we would apply the provisions of sfas regulated enterprises accounting for the discontinuation of application of fasb statement no 
we estimate that the write off of our net regulatory assets at december  could result in a charge to net income of approximately million or per share  which would be classified as an extraordinary item 
in management s opinion  our regulated subsidiaries that currently are subject to the provisions of sfas will continue to be subject to sfas for the foreseeable future 
as is further discussed under the caption regulation and rate matters  in october the madte rendered its decision on the boston gas base rate case and performance based rate plan proposal submitted to the madte in april the rate plans previously in effect for kedny and kedli have expired and the rates established in those plans remain in effect 
the continued application of sfas to record the activities of these subsidiaries is contingent upon the actions of regulators with regard to future rate plans 
we are currently evaluating various options that may be available to us including  but not limited to  proposing new rate plans for kedny and kedli 
the ultimate resolution of any future rate plans could have a significant impact on the application of sfas to these entities and  accordingly  on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
management believes that currently available facts support the continued application of sfas and that all regulatory assets and liabilities are recoverable or refundable in the current regulatory environment 
pension and other postretirement benefits as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  postretirement benefits  keyspan participates in both non contributory defined benefit pension plans  as well as other post retirement benefit opeb plans collectively postretirement plans 
keyspan s reported costs of providing pension and opeb benefits are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience 
pension and opeb costs collectively postretirement costs are impacted by actual employee demographics  the level of contributions made to the plans  earnings on plan assets  and health care cost trends 
changes made to the provisions of these plans may also impact current and future postretirement costs 
postretirement costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions  including  anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the postretirement costs and benefit obligations 
actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over ten years 
certain gas distribution subsidiaries are subject to sfas  and  as a result  changes in postretirement expenses are deferred for future recovery from or refund to gas sales customers 
however  kedny  although subject to sfas  does not have a recovery mechanism in place for changes in postretirement costs 
further  changes in postretirement expenses associated with subsidiaries that service the lipa agreements are also deferred for future recovery from or refund to lipa 
for  the assumed long term rate of return on our postretirement plans assets was pre tax  net of expenses 
this is an appropriate long term expected rate of return on assets based on keyspan s investment strategy  asset allocation and the historical performance of equity and fixed income investments over long periods of time 
the actual year compound annual rate of return for the keyspan plans is greater than 
keyspan s master trust investment allocation policy target is equity and fixed income 
at december   the actual investment allocation was in line with the target 
in an effort to maximize plan performance  actual asset allocation will fluctuate from year to year depending on the then current economic environment 
based on the results of an asset and liability study conducted in projecting asset returns and expected benefit payments over a year period  keyspan has developed a multiyear funding strategy for its postretirement plans 
keyspan believes that it is reasonable to assume assets can achieve or outperform the assumed long term rate of return with the target allocation as a result of historical performance of equity investments over long term periods 
a basis point increase or decrease in the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets would have impacted expense by approximately million  before deferrals 
the year end december  weighted average discount rate used to determine postretirement obligations was 
our discount rate assumption was developed by matching our plans cash flows to the citigroup above median discount curve spot rates 
the resulting yield is then rounded to the nearest basis points 
a basis point increase or decrease in the weighted average year end discount rate would have had no impact on expense 
however  a basis point decrease in the weighted average year end discount rate would result in the recording of an additional minimum pension liability 
a year end discount rate of would have required an additional million debit to other comprehensive income oci before taxes and deferrals 
a year end discount rate of would have required an additional million charge to oci before taxes and deferrals 
at january   the weighted average discount rate used to determine pension and postretirement obligations was 
a basis point increase or decrease in the weighted average discount rate at the beginning of the year would have impacted expense by approximately million  before deferrals 
our health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data  the near term outlook and an assessment of likely long term trends 
the salary growth assumptions reflect our long term outlook 
historically  we have funded our qualified pension plans in excess of the amount required to satisfy minimum erisa funding requirements 
at december   we had a funding credit balance in excess of the erisa minimum funding requirements and as a result keyspan was not required to make any contributions to its qualified pension plans in however  although we have presently exceeded erisa funding requirements  our pension plans  on an actuarial basis  are currently underfunded 
therefore  during keyspan contributed million to its funded and unfunded postretirement plans 
for  keyspan expects to contribute approximately million to its funded and unfunded post retirement plans 
future funding requirements are heavily dependent on actual return on plan assets and prevailing interest rates 
dividends in the fourth quarter of keyspan increased its dividend to an annual rate of per common share beginning with the quarterly dividend to be paid in february our dividend framework is reviewed annually by the board of directors 
the amount and timing of all dividend payments is subject to the discretion of the board of directors and will depend upon business conditions  results of operations  financial conditions and other factors 
based on currently foreseeable market conditions  we intend to maintain the annual dividend at the level 
pursuant to nypsc orders  the ability of kedny and kedli to pay dividends to keyspan is conditioned upon maintenance of a utility capital structure with debt not exceeding and  respectively  of total utility capitalization 
in addition  the level of dividends paid by both utilities may not be increased from current levels if a basis point penalty is incurred under the customer service performance program 
at the end of kedny s and kedli s most recent rate years september  and november   respectively  each company was in compliance with the utility capital structure required by the nypsc 
additionally  we have met the requisite customer service performance standards 
regulation and rate matters gas distribution on september   kedny s rate agreement with the nypsc expired 
under the terms of the agreement  the then current gas distribution rates and all other provisions  including the earnings sharing provision at a return on equity  remain in effect until changed by the nypsc 
under the agreement  kedny is subject to an earnings sharing provision pursuant to which it is required to credit firm customers with of any utility earnings up to basis points above a return on equity other than any earnings associated with discrete incentives and of any utility earnings in excess of basis points above such threshold level 
kedny did not earn above a return on equity in its rate year ended september  on november   kedli s rate agreement with the nypsc expired 
under the terms of the agreement  the gas distribution rates and all other provisions  including the earnings sharing provision  will remain in effect until changed by the nypsc 
under the agreement  kedli is subject to an earnings sharing provision pursuant to which it is required to credit to firm customers of any utility earnings for any rate year ended november  up to basis points above a return on equity of and of any utility earnings in excess of a return on equity of 
kedli did not earn above an return on equity in its rate year ended november  at this time  we are evaluating various options regarding the kedny and kedli rate plans  including but not limited to  proposing new rate plans 
in the meantime  keyspan filed a joint petition for kedny and kedli with the nypsc seeking authority to defer certain costs associated with high gas costs 
specifically  keyspan seeks authority to defer the following costs  each of which is directly linked to increased gas prices i the portion of increased bad debt expense attributable to increased gas cost  ii the return requirement on the increased cost of gas in storage  and iii the return requirement on the increased need for working capital 
keyspan projects total combined deferrals of approximately million and million in and  respectively 
on january   the nypsc noticed the joint petition in the new york state register 
boston gas  colonial gas and essex gas operations are subject to massachusetts s statutes applicable to gas utilities 
rates for gas sales and transportation service  distribution safety practices  issuance of securities and affiliate transactions are regulated by the madte 
effective november   the madte approved a million increase in base revenues for boston gas with an allowed return on equity of reflecting an equal balance of debt and equity 
on january   the madte issued its order on boston gas company s motion for recalculation  reconsideration and clarification that granted an additional million in base revenues  for a total of million 
the madte also approved a performance based rate plan the plan for up to ten years 
on november   the madte approved a base rate increase of million under the plan 
in addition  an increase of million in the local distribution adjustment clause was approved to recover pension and other postretirement costs 
the madte also approved a true up mechanism for pension and other postretirement benefit costs under which variations between actual pension and other postretirement benefit costs and amounts used to establish rates are deferred and collected from or refunded to customers in subsequent periods 
this true up mechanism allows for carrying charges on deferred assets and liabilities at boston gas s weighted average cost of capital 
in connection with the eastern enterprises acquisition of colonial gas in  the madte approved a merger and rate plan that resulted in a ten year freeze of base rates to colonial gas s firm customers 
the base rate freeze is subject only to certain exogenous factors  such as changes in tax laws  accounting changes  or regulatory  judicial  or legislative changes 
due to the length of the base rate freeze  colonial gas discontinued its application of sfas essex gas is also under a ten year base rate freeze and has also discontinued its application of sfas in december  boston gas received a madte order permitting regulatory recovery of the gas cost component of bad debt write offs 
this was approved for full recovery as an exogenous cost effective november  in addition  effective january   boston gas is permitted to fully recover the gas cost component of bad debt write offs through its cost of gas adjustment clause rather than filing for recovery as an exogenous cost 
we have reflected both of these favorable recovery mechanisms in our december  allowance for doubtful accounts reserve requirement and related expense 
boston gas also plans to request full recovery  as an exogenous cost  the gas cost component of bad debt write offs from boston gas ratepayers beginning november electric rate matters keyspan sells to lipa all of the capacity and  to the extent requested  energy conversion services from our existing long island based oil and gas fired generating plants 
sales of capacity and energy conversion services are made under rates approved by the ferc in accordance with the psa entered into between keyspan and lipa in the original ferc approved rates  which had been in effect since may  expired on december  on october  the ferc approved a settlement reached between keyspan and lipa to reset rates effective january  under the new agreement  keyspan s rates reflect a cost of equity of with no revenue increase in the first year 
the ferc approved updated operating and maintenance expense levels and recovery of certain other costs as agreed to by the parties 
see electric services lipa agreements for a discussion of the settlement between keyspan and lipa regarding the current contractual agreements 
the energy policy act of and the public utility holding company acts of and at december   keyspan and certain of its subsidiaries were subject to the jurisdiction of the sec under puhca the rules and regulations under puhca  generally limited the operations of a holding company to a single integrated public utility system  plus additional energy related businesses 
in addition  the principal regulatory provisions of puhca i regulated certain transactions among affiliates within a holding company system  including the payment of dividends by such subsidiaries to a holding company  ii governed the issuance  acquisition and disposition of securities and assets by a holding company and its subsidiaries  iii limited the entry by registered holding companies and their subsidiaries into businesses other than electric and or gas utility businesses  and iv required sec approval for certain utility mergers and acquisitions 
in august  the energy act was enacted by congress and signed into law by the president 
the energy act is a broad based energy bill that places an increased emphasis on the production of energy and promotes the development of new technologies and alternative energy sources by providing tax credits to companies that produce natural gas  oil  coal  electricity and renewable energy 
for keyspan  one of the more significant provisions of the energy act was the repeal of puhca  effective february   and the transfer of certain holding company oversight from the sec to ferc pursuant to puhca pursuant to puhca  the sec no longer has jurisdiction over our holding company activities  other than those traditionally associated with the registration and issuance of our securities under the federal securities laws 
ferc now has jurisdiction over certain of our holding company activities  including i regulating certain transactions among our affiliates within our holding company system  ii governing the issuance  acquisition and disposition of securities and assets by certain of our public utility subsidiaries  and iii approving certain utility mergers and acquisitions 
moreover  our affiliate transactions also remain subject to certain regulations of the nypsc  madte and nhpuc  in addition to ferc 
electric services lipa agreements lipa is a corporate municipal instrumentality and a political subdivision of the state of new york 
on may   certain of lilco s business units were merged with keyspan and lilco s common stock and remaining assets were acquired by lipa 
at the time of this transaction  keyspan and lipa entered into three major long term service agreements that i provide to lipa all operation  maintenance and construction services and significant administrative services relating to the long island electric transmission and distribution t d system pursuant to the management services agreement the msa  ii supply lipa with electric generating capacity  energy conversion and ancillary services from our long island generating units pursuant to the power supply agreement the psa and other long term agreements through which we provide lipa with approximately one half of its customers energy needs  and iii manage all aspects of the fuel supply for our long island generating facilities  as well as all aspects of the capacity and energy owned by or under contract to lipa pursuant to the energy management agreement the ema 
we also purchase energy  capacity and ancillary services in the open market on lipa s behalf under the ema 
the msa  psa and ema all became effective on may  and are collectively referred to as the lipa agreements 
on february   keyspan and lipa entered into i an amended and restated management services agreement the msa  pursuant to which keyspan will continue to operate and maintain the electric t d system owned by lipa on long island  ii a new option and purchase and sale agreement the option agreement  to replace the generation purchase rights agreement as amended  the gpra  pursuant to which lipa had the option  through december   to acquire substantially all of the electric generating facilities owned by keyspan on long island  and iii a settlement agreement the settlement agreement resolving outstanding issues between the parties regarding the lipa agreements 
the msa  the option agreement and the settlement agreement are collectively referred to herein as the lipa agreements 
each of the agreements will become effective as of january  upon all of the lipa agreements receiving the required governmental approvals  otherwise none of the lipa agreements will become effective 
settlement agreement pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement  keyspan and lipa agreed to resolve issues that have existed between the parties relating to the various lipa agreements 
in addition to the resolution of these matters  keyspan s entitlement to utilize lilco s available tax credits and other tax attributes will increase from approximately million to approximately million 
these credits and attributes may be used to satisfy keyspan s previously incurred indemnity obligation to lipa for any federal income tax liability that may result from the settlement of a pending internal revenue service audit for lilco s tax year ended march  in recognition of these items  as well as for the modification and extension of the msa and the elimination of the gpra  upon effectiveness of the settlement agreement keyspan will record a contractual asset in the amount of approximately million  of which approximately million will be attributed to the right to utilize such additional credits and attributes and approximately million will be amortized over the eight year term of the msa 
in order to compensate lipa for the foregoing  keyspan will pay lipa million in cash and will settle certain accounts receivable in the amount of approximately million due from lipa 
generation purchase rights agreement and option agreement 
under an amended gpra  lipa had the right to acquire certain of keyspan s long island based generating assets formerly owned by lilco  at fair market value at the time of the exercise of such right 
lipa was initially required to make a determination by may  but keyspan and lipa agreed to extend the date by which lipa was to make this determination to december  as part of the settlement between keyspan and lipa  the parties entered into the option agreement whereby lipa has the option during the period january  to december  to purchase only keyspan s far rockaway and or ef barrett generating stations and certain related assets at a price equal to the net book value of each facility 
the option agreement replaces the gpra  the expiration of which has been stayed pending effectiveness of the lipa agreements 
in the event such agreements do not become effective by reason of failure to secure the requisite governmental approvals  the gpra will be reinstated for a period of days 
if lipa were to exercise the option and purchase one or both of the generation facilities i lipa and keyspan will enter into an operation and maintenance agreement  pursuant to which keyspan will continue to operate these facilities  through may   for a fixed management fee plus reimbursement for certain costs  and ii the psa and ema will be amended to reflect that the purchased generating facilities would no longer be covered by those agreements 
it is anticipated that the fees received pursuant to the operation and maintenance agreement will offset the reduction in the operation and maintenance expense recovery component of the psa and the reduction in fees under the ema 
management services agreements pursuant to the msa  keyspan manages the day to day operations  maintenance and capital improvements of the t d system 
lipa exercises control over the performance of the t d system through specific standards for performance and incentives 
in exchange for providing the services  the msa provides for a million annual management fee and provides certain incentives and imposes certain penalties based upon performance 
we earn certain incentives for budget under runs associated with the day to day operations  maintenance and capital improvements of lipa s t d system 
these incentives provide for us to i retain on the first million in annual budget under runs  and ii retain of additional annual under runs up to of the total cost budget  thereafter all savings accrue to lipa 
with respect to cost overruns  we absorb the first million of overruns  with a sharing of overruns above million 
there are certain limitations on the amount of cost sharing of overruns 
during  we performed our obligations under the msa within the agreed upon budget and we earned million in non cost performance incentives 
when originally executed the msa had a term expiring on may  in  in connection with an extension of the gpra term  the msa was extended for months through as a result of the recent negotiations and settlement between keyspan and lipa discussed above  the parties entered into the msa 
in place of the previous compensation structure whereby keyspan was reimbursed for budgeted costs  and earned a management fee and certain performance and cost based incentives  keyspan s compensation for managing the t d system under the msa consists of two components a minimum compensation component of million per year and a variable component based on electric sales 
the million component will remain unchanged for three years and then increase annually by  plus inflation 
the variable component  which will comprise no more than of keyspan s compensation  is based on electric sales on long island exceeding a base amount of  gigawatt hours  increasing by in each year 
above that level  keyspan will receive approximately cents per kilowatt hour for the first contract year  cents per kilowatt hour in the second contract year plus an annual inflation adjustment  cents per kilowatt hour in the third contract year plus an annual inflation adjustment  with the per kilowatt hour rate thereafter adjusted annually by inflation 
subject to certain limitations  keyspan will be able to retain all operational efficiencies realized during the term of the msa 
lipa will continue to reimburse keyspan for certain expenditures incurred in connection with the operation and maintenance of the t d system  and other payments made on behalf of lipa  including real property and other t d system taxes  return postage  capital construction expenditures and storm costs 
the msa provides for a number of performance metrics measuring various aspects of keyspan s performance in the operations and customer service areas 
poor performance in any metric may subject keyspan to financial and other non cost penalties such financial penalties not to exceed million in the aggregate for all performance metrics in any contract year 
subject to certain limitations  superior performance in certain metrics can be used to offset underperformance in other metrics 
consistent failure to meet threshold performance levels for two metrics  system average interruption duration index two out of three consecutive years and customer satisfaction index three consecutive years  will constitute an event of default under the msa 
should lipa sell the t d system to a private entity during the term of the msa  lipa shall have the right to terminate the msa  provided that lipa will be required to pay keyspan s reasonable transition costs and a termination fee of a million if the termination date occurs on or before december   and b million if the termination date occurs after december  power supply agreements keyspan sells to lipa all of the capacity and  to the extent requested  energy conversion services from our existing long island based oil and gas fired generating plants 
sales of capacity and energy conversion services are made under rates approved by the ferc 
since october   pursuant to a ferc approved settlement  the rates reflect a cost of equity of with no revenue increase 
the ferc also approved updated operating and maintenance expense levels and keyspan s recovery of certain other costs as agreed to by the parties 
rates charged to lipa include a fixed and variable component 
the variable component is billed to lipa on a monthly per megawatt hour basis and is dependent on the number of megawatt hours dispatched 
lipa has no obligation to purchase energy conversion services from us and is able to purchase energy or energy conversion services on a least cost basis from all available sources consistent with existing interconnection limitations of the t d system 
the psa provides incentives and penalties that can total million annually for the maintenance of the output capability and the efficiency of the generating facilities 
in  we earned million in incentives under this agreement 
the psa has a term of fifteen years through may  with lipa having the option to renew the psa for an additional fifteen year term 
the psa will be terminated in the event that the gpra is renewed and lipa purchases at fair market value certain of keyspan s long island based generating units 
if the lipa agreements receive the requisite governmental approvals and become effective  and if lipa exercises its rights under the option agreement to purchase the two generating plants  then lipa and keyspan will enter into an operation and maintenance agreement  pursuant to which keyspan will continue to operate these facilities for a fixed management fee plus reimbursement for certain costs  and the psa will be amended to reflect that the purchased generating facilities would no longer be covered by the psa 
it is anticipated that the fees received pursuant to the operation and maintenance agreement will offset the reduction in the operation and maintenance expense recovery component of the psa 
energy management agreement the ema provides for keyspan to procure and manage fuel supplies on behalf of lipa to fuel the generating facilities under contract to it and perform off system capacity and energy purchases on a least cost basis to meet lipa s needs 
in exchange for these services we earn an annual fee of million 
in addition  we arrange for off system sales on behalf of lipa of excess output from the generating facilities and other power supplies either owned or under contract to lipa 
lipa is entitled to two thirds of the profit from any off system energy sales 
in addition  the ema provides incentives and penalties that can total million annually for performance related to fuel purchases and off system power purchases 
in  we earned ema incentives in an aggregate of million 
the original term for the fuel supply service is fifteen years  expiring may   and the original term for the off system purchases and sales services described is eight years  expiring may  in march  lipa issued a rfp for system power supply management services beginning may  and fuel management services for certain of its peaking generating units beginning january  keyspan submitted a bid in response to this rfp in april lipa has not yet selected a service provider 
in the event lipa exercises its rights under the option agreement  keyspan and lipa will enter into an amendment to the ema reflecting that the facilities that lipa acquires pursuant to the option agreement are no longer covered under the ema and as noted above  an operation and maintenance agreement  whereby keyspan will continue to operate the newly acquired facilities for a fixed management fee plus reimbursement for certain costs 
it is anticipated that the fees received pursuant to the operation and maintenance agreement will offset the reduction in any fees earned by keyspan pursuant to the ema 
under the lipa agreements and the lipa agreements  we are required to obtain a letter of credit in the aggregate amount of million supporting our obligations to provide the various services if our long term debt is not rated in the a range by a nationally recognized rating agency 
power purchase agreements keyspan glenwood energy center  llc and keyspan port jefferson energy center llc each have year power purchase agreements with lipa expring in the lipa ppas 
under the terms of the lipa ppas  these subsidiaries sell capacity  energy conversion services and ancillary services to lipa 
each plant is designed to produce mw 
pursuant to the lipa ppas  lipa pays a monthly capacity fee  which guarantees full recovery of each plant s construction costs  as well as an appropriate rate of return on investment 
ravenswood generating station we currently sell capacity  energy and ancillary services associated with the ravenswood generating station through a bidding process into the nyiso energy and capacity markets 
energy is sold on both a day ahead and a real time basis 
we also have the ability to enter into bilateral transactions to sell all or a portion of the energy produced by the ravenswood generating station to load serving entities  ie entities that sell to end users or to brokers and marketers 
other contingencies lipa completed its strategic review initiative that it had undertaken in connection with among other reasons  its option under the gpra 
as part of its review  lipa engaged a team of advisors and consultants  held public hearings and explored its strategic options  including continuing its existing operations  municipalizing  privatizing  selling some  but not all of its assets  becoming a regulator of rates and services  or merging with one or more utilities 
upon completion of its strategic review  lipa determined that it would continue its existing operations  as part of its settlement with keyspan and the negotiation of the lipa agreements 
as previously noted  the lipa agreements are subject to governmental approvals  and if such governmental approvals are not received and the lipa agreements do not become effective  then lipa may revisit its strategic review alternatives 
environmental matters keyspan is subject to various federal  state and local laws and regulatory programs related to the environment 
through various rate orders issued by the nypsc  madte and nhpuc  costs related to mgp environmental cleanup activities are recovered in rates charged to gas distribution customers and  as a result  adjustments to these reserve balances do not impact earnings 
however  environmental cleanup activities related to the three non utility sites are not subject to rate recovery 
during  keyspan undertook an extensive review of all its current and former properties that are or may be subject to environmental cleanup activities 
as a result of this study  we adjusted reserve balances for estimated manufactured gas plant mgp related environmental cleanup activities 
as noted above  through various rate orders issued by the nypsc  madte and nhpuc  costs related to mgp environmental cleanup activities are recovered in rates charged to gas distribution customers and  as a result  these adjustments to these reserve balances did not impact earnings 
we estimate that the remaining cost of our mgp related environmental cleanup activities  including costs associated with the ravenswood generating station  will be approximately million and we have recorded a related liability for such amount 
we have also recorded an additional million liability  representing the estimated environmental cleanup costs related to a former coal tar processing facility 
as of december   we have expended a total of million on environmental investigation and remediation activities 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  contractual obligations  guarantees and contingencies for a further explanation of these matters 
market and credit risk management activities market risk keyspan is exposed to market risk arising from potential changes in one or more market variables  such as energy commodity prices  interest rates  volumetric risk due to weather or other variables 
such risk includes any or all changes in value whether caused by commodity positions  asset ownership  business or contractual obligations  debt covenants  exposure concentration  currency  weather  and other factors regardless of accounting method 
we manage our exposure to changes in market prices using various risk management techniques for non trading purposes  including hedging through the use of derivative instruments  both exchange traded and over the counter contracts  purchase of insurance and execution of other contractual arrangements 
keyspan is exposed to price risk due to investments in equity and debt securities held to fund benefit payments for various employee pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
to the extent that the value of investments held change  or long term interest rates change  the effect will be reflected in keyspan s recognition of periodic cost of such employee benefit plans and the determination of contributions to the employee benefit plans 
credit risk keyspan is exposed to credit risk arising from the potential that our counterparties fail to perform on their contractual obligations 
our credit exposures are created primarily through the sale of gas and transportation services to residential  commercial  electric generation  and industrial customers and the provision of retail access services to gas marketers  by our regulated gas businesses  the sale of commodities and services to lipa and the nyiso  the sale of power and services to our retail customers by our unregulated energy service businesses  entering into financial and energy derivative contracts with energy marketing companies and financial institutions  and the sale of gas  oil and processing services to energy marketing and oil and gas production companies 
we have regional concentration of credit risk due to receivables from residential  commercial and industrial customers in new york  new hampshire and massachusetts  although this credit risk is spread over a diversified base of residential  commercial and industrial customers 
customers payment records are monitored and action is taken  when appropriate and in accordance with various regulatory requirements 
we also have credit risk from lipa  our largest customer  and from other energy and financial services companies 
counterparty credit risk may impact overall exposure to credit risk in that our counterparties may be similarly impacted by changes in economic  regulatory or other considerations 
we actively monitor the credit profile of our wholesale counterparties in derivative and other contractual arrangements  and manage our level of exposure accordingly 
in instances where counterparties credit quality has declined  or credit exposure exceeds certain levels  we may limit our credit exposure by restricting new transactions with the counterparty  requiring additional collateral or credit support and negotiating the early termination of certain agreements 
regulatory issues and competitive environment we are subject to various other risk exposures and uncertainties associated with our gas and electric operations 
set forth below is a description of these exposures 
the gas industry new york and long island for the last several years  the nypsc has been monitoring the progress of competition in the energy market 
based upon its findings of the current market and its continued desire to move toward fully competitive markets  the nypsc  in august  issued companion policy statements regarding its vision for the future of competitive markets and guidelines for separately stating the cost of competitive services currently performed by new york utilities 
the nypsc s vision for the future of competitive markets  as stated in the first policy statement  remains unchanged 
items of importance include o elimination of a timeframe for the exit of utilities from the merchant function 
experience  time and maturation of each market customer class will dictate the exit of utilities 
o acknowledgement that competitive commodity markets for the largest customers has occurred 
however  workable competition for the mass markets ie residential and small commercial customers is taking longer and needs to be nurtured 
o future rate filings must include a plan for facilitating customer migration to competitive markets and a fully embedded cost of service study that develops unbundled rates for the utility s delivery service and all potentially competitive services 
o utilities should avoid entering into long term capacity arrangements unless it is necessary for reliability and safety purposes 
o where markets are not workably competitive  the nypsc must ensure that rates continue to be just and reasonable  and protect customers from price volatility 
the nypsc s second policy statement of august addresses the means by which new york utilities should state separately  or unbundle  the costs of competitive and potentially competitive services currently performed by utilities from the cost of providing local distribution service 
the objective of unbundling is to facilitate competition by providing customers with information as to savings available from purchasing competitive services from third party providers  and to credit the customer s utility bill for the cost of unbundled services when they migrate to purchase them from competitive suppliers 
in its unbundling policy statement  the nypsc directed utilities to file with their next base rate proceedings updated cost studies for unbundled competitive services that  once approved by the nypsc  would replace existing backout credits for these services established in prior utility proceedings 
the nypsc also asked utilities to file with the unbundled cost studies a lost revenue recovery mechanism that would permit the utility to recover revenue associated with the difference between the cost the utility is able to avoid when a customer migrates to a competitive service provider and the unbundled rate for that service credited to the customer s bill 
kedny s and kedli s current backout credits for the billing function are both 
per account per month  and were established in may by the nypsc s order establishing retail access billing and payment processing practices 
pursuant to that order  customers that purchase commodity service from third party providers and receive a consolidated bill from the utility receive a 
billing credit on their utility bills 
kedny kedli then invoices the third party commodity provider for the billing service at the same 
per account per month that is credited to the customer s utility bill 
as for the commodity merchant function  kedny s and kedli s existing backout credits are 
dth and 
dth  respectively  as established in may by the nypsc s order adopting terms of gas restructuring joint proposal petition of keyspan energy delivery new york and keyspan energy delivery long island for a multi year restructuring agreement joint proposal 
the joint proposal also established transition balancing accounts tba for kedny and kedli that are funded by property tax refunds and other sums due to firm gas sales customers 
the tbas are currently the mechanisms for kedny and kedli to recover revenue lost to the merchant function backout credit 
while the joint proposal expired in november  the kedny and kedli tariffs provide that the merchant function backout credits and the tbas will remain in effect until november as part of a retail choice program  kedny and kedli will propose a program to facilitate competition in their service territories  cost based unbundled rates for competitive services  and a lost revenue recovery mechanism that prevents them from being harmed by the migration of customers to competitive services 
on december   a petition was filed with the nypsc requesting authority to defer costs associated with high gas prices that are not reflected in existing gas sales rates  including commodity related uncollectible expense  gas working capital and gas in storage 
the nypsc commenced the required day notice of this petition in the new york state register on january  new england in july  the madte directed massachusetts gas distribution companies to undertake a collaborative process with other stakeholders to develop common principles under which comprehensive gas service unbundling might proceed 
a settlement agreement by the local distribution companies ldcs and the marketer group regarding model terms and conditions for unbundled transportation service was approved by the madte in november in february  the madte issued its order on how unbundling of natural gas service will proceed 
for a five year transition period  the madte determined that ldc contractual commitments to upstream capacity will be assigned on a mandatory  pro rata basis to marketers selling gas supply to the ldcs customers 
the approved mandatory assignment method eliminates the possibility that the costs of upstream capacity purchased by the ldcs to serve firm customers will be absorbed by the ldc or other customers through the transition period 
the madte also found that  through the transition period  ldcs will retain primary responsibility for upstream capacity planning and procurement to assure that adequate capacity is available to support customer requirements and growth 
the madte approved the ldcs terms and conditions of distribution service that conform to the settled upon model terms and conditions 
since november   all massachusetts gas customers have the option to purchase their gas supplies from third party sources other than the ldcs 
in january  the madte began a proceeding to re examine whether the upstream capacity market has been sufficiently competitive to allow voluntary capacity assignment 
keyspan submitted comments maintaining its position that the upstream capacity market is not at this time sufficiently competitive to remove or modify the madte s mandatory capacity assignment requirement 
on june   the madte issued an order in its continuing investigation into gas unbundling and found that mandatory capacity assignment should be continued  including continuation of slice of system versus path method of assignment  essentially maintaining the status quo 
beginning on november   the nhpuc began requiring gas utilities to offer transportation services to all commercial and residential customers 
since such time energynorth has provided such transportation in accordance with the nhpuc order 
electric industry minute spinning and non spinning reserves due to the volatility in the market clearing price of minute spinning and non spinning reserves during the first quarter of  the nyiso requested that ferc approve a bid cap on such reserves  as well as requiring a refunding of so called alleged excess payments received by sellers  including the ravenswood facility 
on may   ferc issued an order that granted approval of a per mwh bid cap for minute non spinning reserves  plus payments for the opportunity cost of not making energy sales 
the nyiso s other requests  such as a bid cap for spinning reserves  retroactive refunds  recalculation of reserve prices  etc  were rejected 
the nyiso  the consolidated edison company of new york con edison  niagara mohawk power corporation and rochester gas and electric each individually appealed ferc s order in federal court 
the appeals were consolidated into one case and on november   the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia the court issued its decision in the case of consolidated edison company of new york  inc  v 
federal energy regulatory commission the decision 
essentially  the court found errors in ferc s order and remanded some issues back to ferc for further explanation and action 
on june   the nyiso submitted a motion to ferc seeking refunds as a result of the decision 
keyspan and others submitted statements of opposition opposing the refunds 
on march   ferc issued an order upholding its original decision not to order refunds 
ferc also provided the further explanation requested by the court as to why refunds were not being ordered 
the nyiso and other market participants requested rehearing of ferc s latest order and on november   ferc denied those requests 
the nyiso and various new york transmission owners appealed ferc s november  order to the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia 
may energy market clearing prices due to unseasonably warm weather and scheduled maintenance outages in may  energy prices spiked  and the nyiso revised prices downward after it determined a market design flaw existed which caused prices to be higher than what would occur in a competitive market 
ferc originally agreed with the nyiso  but reversed its original decision on remand from the court of appeals 
on march   ferc issued an order requiring the nyiso to reinstate the original prices for may and  and to pay suppliers  including the ravenswood facility  accordingly 
in  the ravenswood generating station received a million increase in its payments for its may energy sales 
the nyiso and other market participants requested rehearing of this march  order  and on november   ferc denied those requests 
the nyiso and various new york transmission owners appealed ferc s november  order to the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia 
nyiso demand curve capacity market implementation on march  the nyiso made a filing at ferc seeking approval of a demand curve to be used in place of its current deficiency auction for capacity procurement 
on may   ferc approved  with some modifications  the demand curve to become effective may  on october   ferc denied various requests for rehearing of its order approving the demand curve and approved the nyiso s compliance filing 
on december   the nyiso filed its first status report with ferc with respect to how the demand curve was working 
the nyiso report found that there was no evidence of inappropriate withholding of capacity resources and that the demand curve was working as intended 
on december   the electric consumers resource council filed an appeal with the dc circuit court of appeals of ferc s may  order approving the demand curve and its october  order denying rehearing 
on may   this appeal was denied 
nyiso standard market design smd the nyiso s revised market design and software smd  was implemented on february  it replaced the nyiso s current two step real time market system  which consists of the balancing market evaluation and security constrained dispatch applications  with a more integrated real time scheduling system rts 
rts uses a common computing platform  algorithms  and network models for both the real time commitment and real time dispatch functions 
this synergy between commitment and dispatch functions is expected to result in improved consistency between advisory and real time price schedules  as well as more efficient use of control area resources 
smd will more closely align the nyiso markets with the ferc standard market design notice of proposed rule making  issued on july  the nyiso reported that smd is performing as expected  and they continue to monitor the market improvements 
the ravenswood generating station and our new york city operations currently  the nyiso s new york city local reliability rules require that of the electric capacity needs of new york city be provided by in city generators 
on february   the nyiso board increased the in city generator requirement to beginning in may through the period ending on april  based in part on the statewide reserve margin of set by the new york state reliability council 
our ravenswood generating station is an in city generator 
as the electric infrastructure in new york city and the surrounding areas continues to change and evolve and the demand for electric power increases  the in city generator requirement could be further modified 
construction of new transmission and generation facilities may cause significant changes to the market for sales of capacity  energy and ancillary services from our ravenswood generating station 
recently mw of capacity came on line and it is anticipated that another mw of new capacity may be available during as a result of the completion of an in city generation project currently under construction 
we can not  however  be certain as to when the new power plant will be in operation or the nature of future new york city energy  capacity or ancillary services market requirements or design

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financially settled commodity derivative instruments hedging activities from time to time  keyspan subsidiaries have utilized derivative financial instruments  such as futures  options and swaps  for the purpose of hedging the cash flow variability associated with changes in commodity prices 
keyspan is exposed to commodity price risk primarily with regard to its gas distribution operations  gas exploration and production activities and its electric generating facilities 
seneca upshur utilizes otc natural gas swaps to hedge cash flow variability associated with forecasted sales of natural gas 
the ravenswood generating station uses derivative financial instruments to hedge the cash flow variability associated with the purchase of a portion of natural gas or fuel oil that will be consumed during the generation of electricity 
the ravenswood generating station also hedges the cash flow variability associated with a portion of electric energy sales 
during  our gas distribution operations utilized over the counter otc natural gas and fuel oil swaps to hedge the cash flow variability of specified portions of gas purchases and sales associated with certain large volume customers 
these derivative positions have all settled as of december  keyspan uses standard nymex futures prices to value gas futures and market quoted forward prices to value otc swap contracts 
the following tables set forth selected financial data associated with these derivative financial instruments that were outstanding at december  year of volumes fixed price current price fair value type of contract maturity mmcf millions gas otc swaps short natural gas  year of volumes fixed price current price fair value type of contract maturity barrels millions oil swaps long heating oil  year of fixed price current price fair value type of contract maturity mwh millions electricity swaps energy  the following tables detail the changes in and sources of fair value for the above derivatives in millions of dollars change in fair value of derivative hedging instruments millions fair value of contracts at january  net losses on contracts realized decrease in fair value of all open contracts fair value of contracts outstanding at december  in millions of dollars fair value of contracts maturity maturity total sources of fair value in months in and fair value prices actively quoted local published indicies we measure the commodity risk of our derivative hedging instruments indicated in the above table using a sensitivity analysis 
based on a sensitivity analysis as of december   a increase decrease in heating oil and natural gas prices would decrease increase the value of derivative instruments maturing in one year by million 
further  a increase decrease in electricity and fuel prices would decrease increase the value of derivative instruments maturing in one year by million 
firm gas sales derivative instruments regulated utilities we use derivative financial instruments to reduce the cash flow variability associated with the purchase price for a portion of future natural gas purchases associated with our gas distribution operations 
the accounting for these derivative instruments is subject to sfas accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation 
therefore  changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recorded as a regulatory asset or regulatory liability on the consolidated balance sheet 
gains or losses on the settlement of these contracts are deferred and then refunded to or collected from our firm gas sales customers consistent with regulatory requirements
