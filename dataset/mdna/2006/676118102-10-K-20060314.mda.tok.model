revenues for fiscal years and were million and million  respectively  
table of contents representing sales volume of approximately  gold and silver coins in and approximately  gold and silver coins in in sales were made through independent coin dealers at wholesale prices as well as through our direct retail sales telemarketing area 
in  sales were made only through independent coin dealers 
revenues were significantly lower in versus due to a number of factors 
we continue to sell numismatic coins to independent coin dealers 
during the latter half of  we experienced a decrease in numismatic gold coin revenue  relative to  due to a lower availability of our highest value gold coins  a desire to maximize total revenue from coin inventory  and sales to fewer independent coin dealers 
the number of independent dealers dropped from thirteen in to six in of which two dealers represented percent of our total sales 
our experience has shown that many of these independent dealers are primarily interested in the higher quality numismatic coin market 
as our availability of these higher quality coins diminishes  we expect the number of independent dealers interested in our coins to be reduced 
in addition  the sale of silver half dollars to our existing independent coin dealer wholesale channel was significantly reduced from levels  as their main interest has been in the numismatic gold coins 
we are continuing to develop additional indirect sales channels to supplement our coin dealer network for our non graded gold  shipwreck effect silver coins and for other merchandise 
while significant revenue has not yet been realized from these new indirect sales channels  we are building additional distribution for odyssey shipwreck products  which should begin producing revenue in we continued to develop and plan to increase retail distribution of coins and other merchandise through direct sales channels 
however  during our first year of direct sales in  sales volumes were lower than originally expected 
while we have been developing a strong client base with a promising percentage of repeat sales  it has taken longer than expected to generate the numbers of leads and customers necessary to reach our goals 
we continue to investigate alternatives to expand and improve retail distribution of our products 
we believe sales volumes will increase as we continue to build our client base for repeat sales expand our book sales  access leads generated by our attraction and other activities  and increase advertising expenditures for direct response print  television and radio marketing

the major factors that contribute to cost of sales as a percentage of revenue include capitalized ship recovery costs  number of artifacts recovered  revenue per artifact sold and the cost of merchandise and books 
cost of sales as a percentage of revenue will change depending on the sales mix because of the significantly higher unit sales prices for gold than silver coins and other merchandise

in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  we have evaluated whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized 
based on the available evidence  we have concluded that it is more likely than not that those assets would not be realizable without the recovery of high value shipwrecks such as the sussex and thus a valuation allowance has been recorded as of december  we anticipate that we will continue to incur net losses in our ability to generate net income in future periods is dependent upon the success of our ability to recover and monetize high value shipwrecks 
we were optimistic that our search and recovery efforts in would have been more successful than we have reported 
however  we continue to be confident that we have several potential high value shipwreck targets which could be recovered in our current estimates do not include monetizing any assets for shipwrecks which may be recovered in or beyond 
we will continue to reassess the need for a valuation allowance during each future reporting period
