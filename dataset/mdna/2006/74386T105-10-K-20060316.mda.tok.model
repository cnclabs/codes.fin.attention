the bank emphasizes personal service and convenience as part of its customer relationship management strategy 
the bank s strategy is to grow profitably through a commitment to credit quality and expanding market share by acquiring  retaining and expanding customer relationships  while carefully managing interest rate risk 
in recent years  the bank has focused on commercial real estate  construction  multi family and commercial loans as part of its strategy to diversify the loan portfolio and reduce interest rate risk 
these types of loans generally have adjustable rates that initially are higher than residential mortgage loans and generally have a higher rate of risk 
the bank s credit policy focuses on quality underwriting standards and close monitoring of the loan portfolio 
the first sentinel acquisition increased the residential mortgage component of the loan portfolio 
at year end  retail loans accounted for of the loan portfolio and commercial loans accounted for 
the company s strategy is to continue to diversify the loan portfolio and to focus on commercial real estate and commercial and industrial lending relationships 
the company s customer relationship management strategy focuses on increasing core accounts and expanding relationships through its branch network  online banking and telephone banking touch points

at december   core deposits were of total deposits 
a significant amount of capital was raised in the conversion of the bank to a stock chartered bank in management has developed a capital management strategy to effectively utilize excess capital and improve return on equity and earnings per share growth 
the company s capital management strategy includes the following components payment of cash dividends  stock repurchases  acquisitions  and use of wholesale leverage 
the company declared and paid its first cash dividend in the second quarter of  and has since increased the quarterly cash dividend per share five times for a total of

table of contents in  the company repurchased million shares of its common stock at an average cost of per share 
at december   approximately million shares remained eligible for repurchase under the current common stock repurchase authorization 
the company s results of operations are primarily dependent upon net interest income  the difference between interest earned on interest earning assets and the interest paid on interest bearing liabilities 
changes in interest rates could have an adverse effect on net interest income  because as a general matter  the company s interest bearing liabilities reprice or mature more quickly than its interest earning assets 
an increase in interest rates generally would result in a decrease in the company s average interest rate spread and net interest income  which could have a negative effect on profitability 
the company generates non interest income such as income from retail and business account fees  loan servicing fees  loan origination fees  income from loan or securities sales  fees from trust services and investment product sales and other fees 
the company s operating expenses primarily consist of compensation and benefits expenses  marketing and advertising expense  occupancy and equipment expense and other general and administrative expenses 
the company s results of operations are also affected by general economic conditions  changes in market interest rates  actions of regulatory agencies and government policies 
critical accounting policies the calculation of the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting policy of the company 
the allowance for loan losses is a valuation account that reflects management s evaluation of the probable losses in the loan portfolio 
the company maintains the allowance for loan losses through provisions for loan losses that are charged to income 
charge offs against the allowance for loan losses are taken on loans where management determines that the collection of loan principal is unlikely 
recoveries made on loans that have been charged off are credited to the allowance for loan losses 
the company s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses includes a review of all loans on which the collectibility of principal may not be reasonably assured 
for residential mortgage and consumer loans this is determined primarily by delinquency and collateral values 
for commercial real estate and commercial loans  an extensive review of financial performance  payment history and collateral values is conducted on a quarterly basis 
as part of the evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  each quarter management prepares a worksheet 
this worksheet categorizes the entire loan portfolio by certain risk characteristics such as loan type residential mortgage  commercial mortgage  construction  commercial  etc 
and loan risk rating 
when assigning a risk rating to a loan  management utilizes a nine point internal risk rating system 
loans deemed to be acceptable quality are rated one through four  with a rating of one established for loans with minimal risk 
loans that are deemed to be of questionable quality are rated five watch or six special mention 
loans with adverse classifications substandard  doubtful or loss are rated seven  eight or nine  respectively 
commercial mortgage  commercial and construction loans are rated individually and each lending officer is responsible for risk rating loans in his or her portfolio 
these risk ratings are then reviewed by the department manager  the chief lending officer and the credit administration department 
the risk ratings are then confirmed by the loan review department and they are periodically reviewed by the credit committee in the credit renewal or approval process 
management believes the primary risks inherent in the portfolio are possible increases in interest rates  a decline in the economy  generally  and a decline in real estate market values 
any one or a combination of these events may adversely affect borrowers ability to repay the loans  resulting in increased delinquencies  loan losses and future levels of provisions 
accordingly  the company has provided for loan losses at the current level to address the current risk in the loan portfolio 
management considers it important to maintain the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans at an acceptable level given current economic conditions  interest rates and the composition of the portfolio 

table of contents although management believes that the company has established and maintained the allowance for loan losses at adequate levels  additions may be necessary if future economic and other conditions differ substantially from the current operating environment 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the company s allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require the company to recognize additions to the allowance or additional write downs based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination 
although management uses the best information available  the level of the allowance for loan losses remains an estimate that is subject to significant judgment and short term change 
additional critical accounting policies relate to judgments about other asset impairments  including goodwill  investment securities and deferred tax assets 
the company engages an independent third party to perform an annual analysis to test the aggregate balance of goodwill for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
for purposes of goodwill impairment evaluation  the bank is identified as the reporting unit 
fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as goodwill recognized in a business combination and uses standard valuation methodologies including a review of comparable transactions and discounted cash flow analysis 
if the carrying amount of goodwill pursuant to this analysis were to exceed the implied fair value of goodwill  an impairment loss would be recognized 
no impairment loss was required to be recognized for the years ended december   or the company s available for sale securities portfolio is carried at estimated fair value  with any unrealized gains or losses  net of taxes  reported as accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity 
estimated fair values are based on published or securities dealers market prices 
securities which the company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity and carried at amortized cost 
the company conducts a periodic review and evaluation of the securities portfolio to determine if any declines in the fair values of securities are other than temporary 
if such a decline were deemed other than temporary  the company would write down the security to fair value through a charge to current period operations 
the market value of the securities portfolio is significantly affected by changes in interest rates 
in general  as interest rates rise  the market value of fixed rate securities decreases and as interest rates fall  the market value of fixed rate securities increases 
with significant changes in interest rates  the company evaluates its intent and ability to hold securities to maturity or for a sufficient amount of time to recover the recorded principal balance 
the determination of whether deferred tax assets will be realizable is predicated on estimates of future taxable income 
such estimates are subject to management s judgment 
a valuation reserve is established when management is unable to conclude that it is more likely than not that it will realize deferred tax assets based on the nature and timing of these items 
in  the valuation reserve pertaining to the charitable contributions carry forward declined  as a result of the utilization of the related deferred tax asset 
in  the company reduced the valuation reserve pertaining to the charitable contribution carry forward as a result of projected improvement in the company s ability to generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the deferred tax asset 
analysis of net interest income net interest income represents the difference between income on interest earning assets and expense on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income depends on the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the interest rates earned on such assets and paid on such liabilities

provisions for loan losses are charged to operations in order to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level management considers necessary to absorb credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
in determining the level of the allowance for loan losses  management considers past and current loss experience  evaluations of real estate collateral  current economic conditions  volume and type of lending  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay the loan and the levels of non performing and other classified loans 
the amount of the allowance is based on estimates and the ultimate losses may vary from such estimates as more information becomes available or later events change 
management assesses the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis and makes provisions for loan losses in order to maintain the adequacy of the allowance 
the company s emphasis on continued diversification of the loan portfolio through the origination of construction loans  commercial mortgage loans and commercial loans has been one of the more significant factors management takes into account in evaluating the allowance for loan losses and provision for loan losses

certificate of deposit accounts as a percentage of total deposits were at december  compared to at december  certificate of deposit accounts are generally short term 
as of december   of all time deposits had maturities of one year or less compared to at december  the company s ability to retain maturing certificate of deposit accounts is the result of a strategy to remain competitively priced within the marketplace  typically within the upper quartile of rates offered by competitors 
the company s pricing strategy may vary depending upon funding needs and the company s ability to fund operations through alternative sources  primarily by accessing short term lines of credit with the fhlb during periods of pricing dislocation 
quantitative analysis 
the company measures sensitivity to changes in interest rates through the use of balance sheet and income simulation models 
the analyses capture changes in net interest income using flat rates as a base  a most likely rate forecast and rising and declining interest rate forecasts 
the company measures changes in net interest income and net income for the forecast period  generally twelve to twenty four months  within set limits for acceptable change 
the following table sets forth the results of the twelve month projected net interest income model as of december  change in interest rates in basis points rate ramp net interest income amount change change dollars in thousands static the above table indicates that as of december   in the event of a basis point increase in interest rates  whereby rates ramp up evenly over a twelve month period  the company would experience an  or million decrease in net interest income 
in the event of a basis point decrease in interest rates  whereby rates ramp down basis points evenly over a twelve month period  the company would experience a  or million increase in net interest income 
due to the difficulty in accurately predicting the sensitivity of interest bearing deposits to changes in interest rates  the assumptions made in the model regarding deposit repricing reflect a worst case scenario 
the model assumes that all interest bearing deposits  including products with no defined maturity such as passbook savings  
table of contents statement savings  interest bearing checking  and money market accounts  will reprice the full monthly incremental amount for each rate ramp scenario 
although this is unlikely to happen  management believes this is an objective methodology to use in measuring interest rate risk 
another measure of interest rate sensitivity is to model changes in economic value of equity through the use of immediate and sustained interest rate shocks 
the following table illustrates the economic value of equity model results as of december  present value of equity present value of equity as percent of present value of assets change in interest rates dollar amount dollar change percent change present value ratio percent change basis points dollars in thousands flat the above table indicates that as of december   in the event of an immediate and sustained basis point increase in interest rates  the company would experience a  or million reduction in the present value of equity 
if rates were to decrease basis points  the company would experience a  or million increase in the present value of equity 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodologies used in the above interest rate risk measurement 
modeling changes in net interest income requires the making of certain assumptions regarding prepayment and deposit decay rates  which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
while management believes such assumptions to be reasonable  there can be no assurance that assumed prepayment rates and decay rates will approximate actual future loan prepayment and deposit withdrawal activity 
moreover  the net interest income table presented assumes that the composition of interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities 
accordingly  although the net interest income table provides an indication of the company s interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurement is not intended to and does not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on net interest income and will differ from actual results
