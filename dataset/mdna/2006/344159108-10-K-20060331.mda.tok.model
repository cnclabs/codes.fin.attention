forward looking statements  which are based on certain assumptions and describe future plans  strategies  and expectations  are generally identifiable by the use of words or phrases such as believe  plan  expect  intend  anticipate  estimate  project  forecast  may increase  may fluctuate  may improve and similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as will  should  would  and could 
in particular  statements contained in this document that are not historical facts including  but not limited to  statements concerning anticipated revenues  anticipated operating expense levels  potential new products and orders  and expected expense levels relative to our total revenues constitute forward looking statements and are made under the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of our actual results of operations and financial condition have varied  and may in the future vary  significantly from those stated in any forward looking statements 
factors that may cause such differences include  without limitation  the availability of capital to fund our future cash needs  reliance on major customers  history of operating losses  market acceptance of our products  the unpredictability of costs and time to develop new technologies and products  technological obsolescence  competition  successful integration of acquisitions  component supply problems  protection of proprietary information  as well as the accuracy of our internal estimates of revenue and operating expense levels 
for a discussion of these factors and some of the factors that might cause such a difference see also item a 
risk factors 
these factors should be considered in evaluating the forward looking statements  and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements 
we do not undertake  and specifically disclaim any obligations  to update any forward looking statements to reflect occurrences or unanticipated events or circumstances after the date of such statements 
critical accounting policies the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to contract revenues  customer programs and incentives  product returns  accounts receivable allowances  inventory valuation allowances  warranty accruals  deferred tax asset valuation allowances  recoverability of capitalized software development costs  the value of equity instruments issued for services  the recoverability of goodwill and other intangibles related to acquisitions  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we record estimated reductions to revenue for product returns based primarily on historical return rates  return policies and price protection arrangements 
in addition  we sometimes accept returns for stock balancing and negotiate accommodations with customers  which include price discounts  credits and returns  when demand for specific products falls below expectations 
if market conditions for our products were to decline  we could experience an increase in the volume of returns and our reported revenues would be affected accordingly 
however  currently only a limited number of our consumer channel distributors have return rights under their agreements with us 
in connection with these agreements  distributors may return or exchange slow moving inventory held by that distributor 
however  these return rights are limited to of the distributor s prior quarter purchases 
we recognize contract revenue and profit as work progresses on long term  fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion method  which relies on estimates of total expected contract revenue and costs 
we use this method since reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and costs applicable to various stages of the contract can be made 
recognized revenues and profit are subject to revisions as a contract progresses to completion 
revisions in profit estimates are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision became known 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we assess collectibility based on a number of factors  including credit worthiness and past transaction history with the customer 
although collateral is generally not requested  in certain situations we will require confirmed letters of credit or cash in advance of shipping to our customers 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers  our warranty obligation is affected by component and product failure rates 
should actual product failure rates differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than our projections  additional inventory write downs may be required 
our policy on capitalized software costs determines the timing of our recognition of certain development costs 
in addition  this policy determines whether the cost is classified as development expense or cost of revenues 
we use professional judgment in determining whether development costs meet the criteria for immediate expense or capitalization 
our business acquisitions have resulted in goodwill and other intangible assets  which affect the possible future impairment expense that we may incur  and in the case of intangible assets  the amount of future period amortization expense 
in assessing the recoverability of our goodwill and other intangibles we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets which will reduce their value and could affect current period reported earnings 
we performed our annual impairment assessment of goodwill and intangible assets in the fourth quarter of we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
results of operations overview in  we began to reap the benefits of our technology investments and the systems group acquisitions of como and visual circuits that we made in overall company revenue grew year over year with the systems group growing 
the main drivers of the systems revenue growth were our firestore product line and expanded sales in europe of all products 
the previously anticipated industry trend to high definition hd video format and the need for greater storage capacity in a digital world are driving increased demand for our systems products 
professional and pro sumer videographers are using hd more frequently in their recording and post production activities  and focus products offer significant productivity gains 
the growing number of daily network and cable telecasts  movies and other special programming now coming in hd  bodes well for demand in this key market segment 
in  the semiconductor group substantially expanded its customer base and target markets  which compensated for the termination of microsoft s xbox business in as digital media is being transported through an ever increasing number of devices  demand for semiconductor convergence chips  like those of our semiconductor group  is appearing in virtually every part of the electronics sector  including  among other products  end products for iptv set top boxes  portable media players  automotive and mobile entertainment  medical imaging  handheld gps systems  and cell phones 
the impact of new products and increased revenue increased our absolute gross margin by  from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  continuing the significant investment which began in  the majority of our semiconductor group s resources was invested in the development of our uwb technology 
the semiconductor group increased staffing from the year ended december  in connection with its work on uwb and continued with its development agreements 
as such  our semiconductor group s research and development expenses increased million  or  from in  significant progress was made in developing our uwb wireless video technology 
in september of  we accomplished the first major milestone with the tape out of the analog chip and we received working samples of that chip in november of the digital chip  the second chip of our two chip chip set  was taped out in march of we expect working samples in the second quarter of year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenue years ended december  increase increase dollars in thousands decrease decrease system products semiconductor products revenue for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million compared with the year ended december  for the year ended december   sales of system products were approximately million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million or 
this increase in sales of our system products mainly reflects the introduction of a new variation of firestore the fs and sales of products acquired through the acquisitions of como in february and visual circuits in may  partially offset by a decrease in sales of our consumer scan conversion and home theater products 
our consumer scan conversion product sales have decreased in recent years as an increasing number of personal computers and televisions now incorporate scan conversion technology 
we discontinued our home theater line in sales of semiconductor products to distributors and oem customers were approximately million in the year ended december   compared to million for the  decrease in sales of semiconductor products approximately mainly reflects a million decrease in sales of our fs chip  partially offset by production ramps in for internet protocol television iptv set top boxes and portable media players by our customers incorporating our chips in their device designs 
the decrease in sales of our fs chip was primarily due to microsoft ceasing significant orders for the fs in january the fs had been used by microsoft in its xbox 
at december   we had a backlog of approximately  for products ordered by customers  compared to a backlog of million at december  the decrease between december  and december  reflects orders for our digital video mixer and firestore products at december   reflecting delays in these new product releases until the first quarter of our backlog orders frequently vary and are not indicative of quarterly performance for the products reflected in such order backlogs 
gross margin years ended december  dollars in thousands increase gross margin gross margin rate our gross margin rate for the year ended december  increased by percentage points to from in the year ended december  the increase in gross margin rate mainly reflects increased sales volumes  the below average gross margin business that we had conducted with microsoft in the three months ended march   which did not occur in the year ended december    of inventory acquired from como and visual circuits and sold in at low margin  and an accrual in of  for a royalty payment based on the achievement of certain sales volumes 
these factors were partially offset by the increase in sales discounts and low margin chip sales to one customer in the year ended december  operating expenses years ended december  dollars in thousands increase of of of revenue revenue revenue sales  marketing and support general and administrative research and development sales  marketing and support sales  marketing and support expenses for year ended december  were million  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million or from the prior year 
the increase in sales  marketing and support expenses mainly reflects an increase in salary expense of  resulting from an overall increase in headcount of in our business development and customer support departments and semiconductor group 
also contributing to the increase sales  marketing and support expenses were additional advertising expenses of  associated with introductions of our new fs and mixer products  and increased sales and representative commission expense of  as a result of increased revenues attributable to our new products 
the increase in sales  marketing and support expenses also reflects  to a lesser extent  the inclusion of visual circuits and como s sales and marketing expenses for the entire period 
visual circuits and como s expenses were only partially included in the year ended december  as the respective acquisitions occurred on may  and february   respectively 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of  or 
the increase in general and administrative expenses was mainly due to an increase in personnel and personnel related costs of  mainly reflecting the addition of three employees  stock compensation charges of  related to restricted stock and warrants expensed in  and the extension of employee stock options in research and development research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
the increase in research and development expenses reflects almost entirely our investment in uwb technology  which resulted in an increase in research and development expenses of million over those in this increased investment in uwb consisted mainly of an increase in semiconductor design service fees of million  increased personnel costs of million  reflect employees hired during the later part of and six additional employees hired during  and an increase in direct material and prototyping costs of  in  to complete the uwb products we plan continued significant investment in the development of the uwb technology see note  management s plans 
the increase in research and development expenses in the year ended december   was partially offset by expense reductions in our systems business research and development activities mainly reflecting decreased prototyping material costs 
amortization amortization expense was recorded as follows years ended december  increase in thousands decrease cost of revenue operating expenses amortization expense for the year ended december  was  a decrease of  or from million in such expenses for the year ended december  the decrease in amortization expense reflects the completion of amortization for certain intangible assets associated with the acquisition of videonics  partially offset by an increase in amortization expense associated with the intangible assets purchased in the acquisitions of como in february and visual circuits in may interest expense  net and other expense  net years ended december  dollars in thousands increase interest expense  net other expense  net net interest expense for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of  or 
the increase in net interest expense primarily reflects interest expense associated with our accounts receivable based line of credit and term loan  both of which were not outstanding in the increase in net interest expense was partially offset by interest expense on convertible promissory notes  which were outstanding until their conversion into common and preferred stock in march other expense for the year ended december  consists mainly of expense associated with exchange rate differences related to transactions denominated in euros

this increase in sales of our systems products mainly reflects sales of products of approximately million resulting from the acquisitions of como in february and visual circuits in may  as well as the introduction of new products  including new variations of firestore  partially offset by a decrease in sales of our consumer scan conversion and mixer products 
revenue from mixer product sales has been trending lower from previous years as video enthusiasts move from stand alone editing systems to computer based or non linear editing systems 
also contributing to the decrease in mixer revenue in was the discontinuation of third party components and our inability to redesign our product in a timely manner 
these delays resulted in periods during the third and fourth quarters of when we were without certain mixer products 
by january  we had redesigned and were shipping two new mixer products  thereby replacing the two previously discontinued mixer products 
our consumer scan conversion product sales have decreased as an increasing number of personal computers and televisions now incorporate scan conversion technology 
sales of semiconductor products to distributors and oem customers were approximately million in the year ended december   compared to million for the million decrease in sales of semiconductor products mainly reflects significantly reduced sales of our fs chip to microsoft  which was for use in microsoft s xbox 
in january  microsoft ceased placing significant orders for our fs product 
shipments of the fs  which were primarily to microsoft  represented and of our total revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
at december   we had a backlog of approximately million for products ordered by customers  compared to a backlog of million at december  the increase between december  and december  reflects orders for our digital video mixer and portable firestore product  offset by decreased orders of our fs chip 
gross margin years ended december  dollars in thousands decrease gross margin gross margin rate our gross margin rate for year ended december  decreased by percentage points to from in the year ended december  this decrease in the gross margin rate reflects an increase in write downs for excess and obsolete inventory of  in compared to   of inventory acquired from como and visual circuits sold at low margin  amortization of developed technology of  from the acquisitions of como and visual circuits in and an accrual of  for a royalty payment based on the achievement of certain sales volumes 
these factors were partially offset by the lower amount of microsoft business in compared to  which was at below average gross margin 
sales to microsoft were made at a gross profit margin percentage of less than  primarily as a result of volume discounts provided

the increase in general and administrative expenses was mainly due to an increase in personnel and personnel related costs of  mainly reflecting additional headcount of five employees  primarily associated with the acquisitions of como and visual circuits  and a change in classification of certain personnel from research and development in to administrative roles in  which amount was  in also contributing to the increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were increases in public relations expenses of  and accounting and auditing fees of  research and development research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
the increase in research and development expenses mainly reflects additional headcount of employees  and associated expenditure  related to our investment in uwb technology and acquisitions of como and visual circuits in february and may of  respectively 
this increase in our investment in uwb technology was the primary factor that resulted in our semiconductor business increasing its research and development spending to million for compared to million for these increases in research and development expenses were partially offset by a change in classification of certain personnel year over year from research and development in to administrative roles in amortization amortization expense was recorded as follows years ended december  in thousands increase cost of revenue operating expenses amortization expense for year ended december  was million  an increase of  from  for the year ended december  the increase in amortization expense reflects additional amortization expense associated with the intangible assets that resulted from the acquisitions of como in february and visual circuits in may this additional amortization expense was partially offset by the completion of amortization on certain intangible assets in restructuring expense for the year ended december   we reduced our restructuring expense accrual by  as we were able to settle amounts due on the closure of our facility in chelmsford  massachusetts  for an amount less than originally estimated

liquidity and capital resources the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis  which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business 
for the years ended december   and  we incurred net losses of million  million and million  respectively  and used cash in operating activities of million  million and million  respectively 
these factors indicate that we may potentially be unable to continue as a going concern 
the consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern 
our continuation as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient positive cash flows to meet our obligations on a timely basis  to obtain additional financing as may be required  and ultimately to return to profitability 
since inception  we have financed our operations primarily through the public and private sale of common stock  lines of credit and debt borrowings from financial institutions  proceeds from the exercise of options and warrants  short term borrowings from private lenders and credit arrangements with vendors and suppliers

the loss of this customer had a material adverse effect on our revenues  operating profit and liquidity in the year ended december   when compared to however  as the product was manufactured by one of our contract manufacturers  we did not experience any significant adjustments to our staffing or operations or significant adjustments to the carrying value of our fs inventory  as a result of the loss of the microsoft business 
we expect that our operating cash flows may fluctuate in future periods as a result of fluctuations in our operating results  shipment timetable and accounts receivable collections  inventory management  and the timing of payments among other factors

capital resources and liquidity outlook we have incurred losses and used net cash in operating activities in each of the three years in the period ended december   and as such  have been dependent upon raising money for short and long term cash needs through issuance of debt  proceeds from the exercise of options and warrants  and the sale of our common stock in private placements 
for the years ended december   and  we received net proceeds of approximately million  million and million  respectively  from the sale of approximately million shares  million shares and million shares  respectively  of our common stock in private placement transactions 
in november  we obtained a revolving million bank credit line under which we can borrow up to of our eligible outstanding accounts receivable  excluding accounts receivable of como 
carl berg  a company director and shareholder  provided a personal guarantee to secure this credit line 
in connection with this credit line  the greater bay bank obtained a first priority security interest on our accounts receivable through an agreement with mr 
berg  which enabled mr 
berg to retain his existing security interest in all of our assets while subordinating to greater bay bank his security interest in our accounts receivable 
the bank credit line is subject to ongoing covenants  including a covenant related to operating results 
interest is payable under this loan at prime plus as of december  
at december   there was an outstanding balance on this credit line of the maximum available amount of million 
the credit line expires on december  on june   we signed a term loan agreement with greater bay bank under which we can borrow up to million 
the term loan has a maturity date of december   is interest only until maturity and is in addition to our existing million accounts receivable based secured line of credit facility described above with this same bank 
interest is payable under this loan at prime plus as of december  
at december   there was an outstanding balance under this term loan of the maximum available amount of million 
subsequent developments on january   we raised gross proceeds of  from the issuance of secured convertible notes to a group of private investors 
while we believe that these funds  along with the cash flow generated by our expanding systems business  should be adequate to enable us to complete our uwb engineering development and launch commercialization of uwb products  depending upon the results and timing of our uwb initiative and the profitability of our systems business  we may need to raise further capital in there can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be raised 
moreover  any equity financing or convertible debt financing would result in dilution to our existing stockholders and could have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock 
furthermore  any additional debt financing will result in higher interest expense
