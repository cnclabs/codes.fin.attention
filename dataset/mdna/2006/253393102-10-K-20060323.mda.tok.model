table of contents liquidity and capital resources our primary capital requirements are for working capital  capital improvements and to support expansion plans  as well as for various investments in store remodeling  store fixtures and ongoing infrastructure improvements 
the company s main source of liquidity in was our net cash provided from operations 
the main sources of liquidity in were our cash provided from operations  borrowings under the credit facility  and net proceeds from the issuance of the convertible notes 
the change in cash and cash equivalents is as follows fiscal year ended january  january  january  net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in provided by financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents operating activities cash flow from operations is seasonal in our business 
typically  we use cash flow from operations to increase inventory in advance of peak selling seasons  with the pre christmas inventory increase being the largest 
in the fourth quarter  inventory levels are reduced in connection with christmas sales and this inventory reduction  combined with proportionately higher net income  typically produces significantly positive cash flow 
cash provided by operating activities increased by million in to million  which consists primarily of higher net income of million and an increase in the change in assets and liabilities of million 
changes in assets and liabilities the primary factors contributing to the increase in the change in assets and liabilities were the change in accounts receivable  accounts payable and income taxes payable  partially offset by an increase in the change in inventory 
the change in accounts receivable was primarily a result of the decrease in the income tax receivable due to the net operating losses acquired as a result of the galyan s transaction 
the increase in the change in accounts payable was primarily due to the increase in holiday receipts remaining in accounts payable as compared to the prior year along with an increase in inventory in transit at year end compared to the increase in the change in income taxes payable was primarily related to the usage of the net operating losses in the current year as noted above 
partially offsetting these cash inflows was the increase in inventory which was primarily due to the increase in inventory in transit

there were no building sale leasebacks during during  we completed four building sale leaseback transactions that generated proceeds of million  of which million of the capital expenditures were incurred in the decrease in new  relocated and remodeled stores capital expenditures is primarily due to a decrease in the number of stores with construction allowances in and last year s conversion of the galyan s stores to dick s stores 
the increase in future store capital spend is due primarily to the greater number of stores expected to open in existing store capital spend increased as a result of exterior sign conversions for the former galyan s stores along with updated information technology assets in the existing stores as we continue to upgrade our infrastructure and technology 
the company also generated million in proceeds from the sale of a portion of the company s non cash investment in its third party internet commerce service provider during as compared to million in proceeds during financing activities cash used in financing activities increased by million to million primarily reflecting higher payments under the credit agreement in  and the impact of the net proceeds from the senior convertible notes in financing activities consisted primarily of the net payments under the credit agreement and proceeds from transactions in the company s common stock

newly issued accounting standards in december  the fasb issued statement no 
r  share based payment  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
as permitted by fasb no 
 the company currently accounts for share based payments to employees using apb no 
s intrinsic value method and  as such  recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options or our employee stock purchase plan 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas r s fair value method will have an impact on the company s results of operations  although it will have no impact on the company s overall financial position or cash flows 
had the company adopted sfas r in prior periods  the impact of that standard for years ended january  and january  would have approximated the impact of fasb no 
as described in the disclosure of proforma net income and earnings per share in note of the consolidated financial statements 
sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while the company cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amount of operating cash flows recognized for such excess tax deductions were million  million and million during fiscal  and  respectively 
the company will adopt the new requirements using the modified prospective transition method beginning in fiscal in october  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp fas  accounting for rental costs incurred during a construction period 
this fsp requires rental costs associated with operating leases that are incurred during a construction period to be recognized as rental expense 
the company historically capitalized rental costs incurred during a construction period 
the guidance permits either retroactive or prospective treatment for periods beginning after december  we will prospectively change our policy from capitalization to expensing beginning in fiscal the adoption of this fsp will not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued statement no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas 
sfas clarifies that abnormal inventory costs such as costs of idle facilities  excess freight and handling costs  and wasted materials are required to be recognized as current period charges 
the provisions of sfas are effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the adoption of sfas in fiscal is not expected to have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 

table of contents critical accounting policies and use of estimates the company s significant accounting policies are described in note of the consolidated financial statements  which were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
critical accounting policies are those that the company believes are both most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations  and require the company s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
the company considers the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing its consolidated financial statements 
inventory valuation the company values inventory using the lower of weighted average cost or market method 
market price is generally based on the current selling price of the merchandise 
the company regularly reviews inventories to determine if the carrying value of the inventory exceeds market value and the company records a reserve to reduce the carrying value to its market price  as necessary 
historically  the company has rarely experienced significant occurrences of obsolescence or slow moving inventory 
however  future changes such as customer merchandise preference  unseasonable weather patterns  or business trends could cause the company s inventory to be exposed to obsolescence or slow moving merchandise 
shrink expense is accrued as a percentage of merchandise sales based on historical shrink trends 
the company performs physical inventories at the stores and distribution centers throughout the year 
the reserve for shrink represents an estimate for shrink for each of the company s locations since the last physical inventory date through the reporting date 
estimates by location and in the aggregate are impacted by internal and external factors and may vary significantly from actual results 
vendor allowances vendor allowances include allowances  rebates and cooperative advertising funds received from vendors 
these funds are determined for each fiscal year and the majority are based on various quantitative contract terms 
amounts expected to be received from vendors relating to the purchase of merchandise inventories are recognized as a reduction of cost of goods sold as the merchandise is sold 
amounts that represent a reimbursement of costs incurred  such as advertising  are recorded as a reduction to the related expense in the period that the related expense is incurred 
the company records an estimate of earned allowances based on the latest projected purchase volumes and advertising forecasts 
on an annual basis at the end of the year  the company confirms earned allowances with vendors to ensure the amounts are recorded in accordance with the terms of the contract 
goodwill  intangible assets and impairment of long lived assets goodwill and other intangible assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis 
our evaluation of goodwill for impairment requires accounting judgments and financial estimates in determining the fair value of such assets 
if these judgments or estimates change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
the company reviews long lived assets whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
assets are reviewed at the lowest level for which cash flows can be identified  which is the store level 
in determining future cash flows  significant estimates are made by the company with respect to future operating results of each store over its remaining lease term 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
business combinations our acquisition of galyan s was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
the assets and liabilities of galyan s were adjusted to their fair values and the excess of the purchase price over the net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill 
the determination of fair value involved the use of an independent appraisal  estimates and assumptions which we believe provided a reasonable basis for determining fair value 

table of contents self insurance the company is self insured for certain losses related to health  workers compensation and general liability insurance  although we maintain stop loss coverage with third party insurers to limit our liability exposure 
liabilities associated with these losses are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience  industry factors  severity factors and other actuarial assumptions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company s net exposure to interest rate risk will consist primarily of borrowings under the senior secured revolving credit facility 
the company s senior secured revolving credit facility bears interest at rates that are benchmarked either to us short term floating rate interest rates or one month libor rates  at the company s election 
there were no borrowings outstanding under the senior secured revolving credit facility as of january  outstanding borrowings under the senior secured revolving credit facility were million as of january  the impact on the company s annual net income of a hypothetical one percentage point interest rate change on the average outstanding balances under the senior secured revolving credit facility would be approximately million based upon fiscal average borrowings 
credit risk in february  the company sold million issue price of senior unsecured convertible notes due convertible notes 
in conjunction with the issuance of these convertible notes  we also entered into a five year convertible bond hedge and a five year separate warrant transaction with one of the initial purchasers the counterparty and or certain of its affiliates 
subject to the movement in our common stock price  we could be exposed to credit risk arising out of net settlement of the convertible bond hedge and separate warrant transaction in our favor 
based on our review of the possible net settlements and the credit strength of the counterparty and its affiliates  we believe that we do not have a material exposure to credit risk as a result of these share option transactions 
impact of inflation the company does not believe that operating results have been materially affected by inflation during the preceding three fiscal years 
there can be no assurance  however  that operating results will not be adversely affected by inflation in the future 
tax matters presently  the company does not believe that there are any tax matters that could materially affect the consolidated financial statements 
seasonality and quarterly results the company s business is subject to seasonal fluctuations 
significant portions of the company s net sales and profits are realized during the fourth quarter of the company s fiscal year  which is due  in part  to the holiday selling season and  in part  to our sales of cold weather sporting goods and apparel 
any decrease in fiscal fourth quarter sales  whether because of a slow holiday selling season  unseasonable weather conditions  or otherwise  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results for the entire fiscal year
