overview we are a focused diversified industrial manufacturing company comprised of two operating segments water and technical products 
our water group is a global leader in providing innovative products and systems used worldwide in the movement  treatment  storage  and enjoyment of water 
our technical products group is a global leader in the global enclosures market that designs  manufactures  and markets standard  modified  and custom enclosures that house and protect sensitive controls  components  thermal management products  and accessories 
in  our water group and technical products group are forecasted to generate approximately percent and percent of total revenues  respectively 
our water group has progressively become a more important part of our business portfolio with sales increasing from million in to approximately billion in we believe the water industry is structurally attractive as a result of a growing demand for clean water and the large global market size of which we have identified a target industry segment totaling billion 
our vision is to become a leading global provider of innovative products and systems used in the movement  treatment  storage  and enjoyment of water 
as of july   we continued the expansion of our global footprint in the water equipment industry through the acquisition of wicor  a manufacturer of pumps  filtration  and pool equipment marketed primarily under the sta rite  shurflo  and hypro brands 
we initially funded the payment of the purchase price and related fees and expenses of the wicor acquisition with an million committed line of credit the bridge facility and through additional borrowings available under our existing credit facility 
we used the proceeds from the tools group sale to repay  on october   the million bridge facility 
we realized million in synergies net of integration costs in the first full year of ownership with respect to the wicor acquisition via key initiatives including facility rationalizations  lean enterprise  material cost savings  and administrative cost savings 
we also expect to achieve significant working capital reductions  net fixed asset reductions  and revenue synergies from cross selling opportunities during the first two years of ownership as a result of the acquisition 
integration of the former wicor businesses proceeded as expected during with facilities closed or consolidated to date 
our technical products group operates in a large global market with significant potential for growth in industry segments such as defense  security  medical  and networking 
we believe we have the largest enclosures industrial and commercial distribution network in north america and highest enclosures brand recognition in the industry 
from mid through mid  the technical products group experienced significantly lower sales volumes as a result of severely reduced capital spending in the industrial and commercial markets and over capacity and weak demand in the datacom and telecom markets 
in and  sales volumes increased due to the addition of new distributors  new products  and higher demand in all targeted markets 
in addition  through the success of our pims initiatives  we have increased technical products segment margins for sixteen consecutive quarters 
key trends and uncertainties the following trends and uncertainties affected our financial performance in and may impact our results in the future in  we achieved approximately six percent sales growth on a proforma basis  assuming we had acquired wicor at the beginning of  excluding the recent thermal acquisition  and excluding the effects of foreign currency translation 

table of contents we plan to drive strategic growth initiatives in both our water and technical products platforms  with particular emphasis on international growth 
we expect our operations to continue to benefit from our pims initiative including strategy deployment  lean enterprise with special focus on sourcing and supply management  cash management  and lean operations  and ignite  our process to drive organic growth 
we are experiencing material cost inflation in a number of our businesses 
we are striving for greater productivity improvements and implementing selective increases in selling prices to help mitigate cost increases in base materials such as steel  resins  ocean freight and fuel  health care  and insurance 
free cash flow  which we define as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures  including both continuing and discontinued operations  plus proceeds from sale of property and equipment  exceeded million for the fourth consecutive year and is expected to be approximately million in see our discussion of other financial measures under the caption liquidity and capital resources of this report 
in  we experienced favorable foreign currency effects in the first half of the year and unfavorable in the second half of the year 
overall  we experienced a slightly favorable foreign currency effect in our currency effect is primarily for the us dollar against the euro  which may not trend favorably in the future 
we expect our overall effective tax rate to be percent in as a part of our acquisition and international strategies  we are pursuing rate reduction opportunities  which could improve our effective tax rate 
as anticipated  our water group operating income margins in each of the first two quarters of were lower compared to the prior year comparable periods due to the lower former wicor operating margins versus pentair water operating margins 
in the third quarter of  the water group s operating margins crossed over and both the third and fourth quarter operating margins were higher than the same quarters in in the future  we intend to drive margins in the expanded water group toward a goal of percent  while capturing growth opportunities 
we experience seasonal demand in a number of markets within our water group 
end user demand for pool spa equipment follows warm weather trends and is at seasonal highs from march to july 
the magnitude of the sales spike is partially mitigated by effective use of the distribution channel by employing some advance sales programs generally including extended payment terms and or additional discounts 
demand for residential and agricultural water systems is also impacted by weather patterns particularly related to heavy flooding and droughts 
outlook in  our operating objectives include the following continue to use pims to drive the three key elements of our strategy operating excellence  international expansion  and growth  both organic and acquired  continue the integration of the wicor and thermal acquisitions and realize identified synergistic opportunities  continue proactive talent management process building competencies in international management and other key functional areas  achieve significant organic sales growth in excess of market growth  particularly in international markets  and continue to make strategic acquisitions to grow and expand our existing platforms in our water and technical products segments

the increased days of sales in accounts receivable as of december  compared to december  is the result of the differences in sales terms offered by the former wicor business compared to the terms offered by our former tools group and the sale of approximately a million interest in a pool of accounts receivable to a third party financial institution in the increased days inventory on hand as of december  compared to december  was driven by the increased inventory levels attributable to increased sourcing out of asia  higher value of inventories due to rising raw material input costs  and inventory redundancies associated with the ramp up of new facilities and the wind down of old facilities 
the working capital ratios as of december  versus december  have increased  primarily for the same reasons 
in the future  we expect our working capital ratios to improve as we are able to capitalize on the anticipated success of our post acquisition integration activities and pims initiatives 
cash provided by operating activities was million in  or million higher compared with the same period in the increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to an increase in net income offset by higher levels of inventory due to inventory builds to support customers during product transfers and plant consolidation activities in water

the interest rate on the loans under the million credit facility is libor plus 
interest rates and fees on the credit facility vary based on our credit ratings 
we are authorized to sell short term commercial paper notes to the extent availability exists under the credit facility 
we use the credit facility as back up liquidity to support of commercial paper 
table of contents outstanding 
as of december   we had million of commercial paper outstanding that matured within days 
all of the commercial paper was classified as long term as we have the intent and the ability to refinance such obligations on a long term basis under the credit facility 
availability under our credit facility at december   including outstanding commercial paper  was approximately million 
effective following the close of business on july   we completed the acquisition of wicor 
we funded the payment of the purchase price and related fees and expenses of the wicor acquisition with the bridge facility and through additional borrowings available under our existing credit facility 
the interest rate on the bridge facility and loans under the credit facility during the period of the bridge facility was libor plus on october   we received approximately million of proceeds from the sale of our tools group to bdk 
as required under the terms of the bridge facility  we used the proceeds from the tools group sale and additional borrowings under the credit facility to pay off the bridge facility 
following payment of the bridge facility and based on our existing credit ratings  the interest rate on loans under the credit facility decreased to libor plus 
in addition to the credit facility  we have million of uncommitted credit facilities  under which we had no borrowings as of december  our current credit ratings are as follows rating agency long term debt rating current rating outlook standard poor s bbb stable moody s baa stable we believe the potential impact of a downgrade in our financial outlook is currently not significant to our liquidity exposure or cost of debt 
a credit rating is a current opinion of the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific financial obligation  a specific class of financial obligations  or a specific financial program 
the credit rating takes into consideration the creditworthiness of guarantors  insurers  or other forms of credit enhancement on the obligation and takes into account the currency in which the obligation is denominated 
on the other hand  the ratings outlook highlights the potential direction of a short or long term rating 
it focuses on identifiable events and short term trends that cause ratings to be placed under observation by the respective rating agencies 
a change in rating outlook does not mean a rating change is inevitable 
prior changes in our ratings outlook have had no immediate impact on our liquidity exposure or on our cost of debt 
we issue short term commercial paper notes that are currently not rated by standard poor s or moody s 
even though our short term commercial paper is unrated  we believe a downgrade in our long term debt rating could have a negative impact on our ability to continue to issue unrated commercial paper 
we do not expect that a one rating downgrade of our long term debt by either standard poor s or moody s would substantially affect our ability to access the long term debt capital markets 
however  depending upon market conditions  the amount  timing and pricing of new borrowings could be adversely affected 
if both of our long term debt ratings were downgraded to below bbb baa  our flexibility to access the term debt capital markets would be reduced 
in the event of a downgrade of our long term debt rating  the cost of borrowing and fees payable under our credit facility and million private placement fixed rate note could increase 
while the credit facility has a pricing grid based in part on credit ratings  we do not have any agreements under which the obligations are accelerated in the event of a ratings downgrade 
as of december   our capital structure consisted of million in total indebtedness and  million in shareholders equity 
the ratio of debt to total capital at december  was percent  compared with percent at december  our targeted debt to total capital ratio is percent or less 
we expect to continue to have cash requirements to support working capital needs and capital expenditures  to pay interest and service debt and to pay dividends to shareholders 
in order to meet these cash 
table of contents requirements  we intend to use available cash and internally generated funds and to borrow under our committed and uncommitted credit facilities 
we paid dividends in of million  compared with million in and million in we anticipate continuing the practice of paying dividends on a quarterly basis 
in december  the board of directors authorized the development of a program and process to repurchase shares of our common stock up to a maximum dollar limit of million of our common stock annually 
there is no expiration associated with the authorization granted 
in  we repurchased  shares at million under this plan 
as of february   we had not repurchased any additional shares under this plan and  accordingly  we have the authority in to repurchase shares up to a maximum dollar limit of million 
in and  respectively  we repurchased  shares and  shares of our common stock under similar plans

as of december   variable interest rate debt was million at a weighted average interest rate of 
a purchase obligation is defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on us that specifies all significant terms 
the purchase obligation amounts do not represent our total anticipated future purchases  but represent those purchases for which we are contractually obligated 
as of december   we did not have any purchase obligations requiring cash outflows of million or greater per year 
we expect to make contributions in the range of million to million to our pension plans in other financial measures in addition to measuring our cash flow generation or usage based upon operating  investing  and financing classifications included in the consolidated statements of cash flows  we also measure our free cash flow and our conversion of net income 
free cash flow and conversion of net income are non gaap financial measures that we use to assess our cash flow performance and have a long term goal to consistently generate free cash flow that equals or exceeds percent conversion of net income 
we believe free cash flow and conversion of net income are important measures of operating performance because they provide us and our investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to pay dividends and repay debt 
in addition  free cash flow and conversion of net income are used as a criterion to measure and pay compensation based incentives 
our measure of free cash flow and conversion of net income may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
the following table is a reconciliation of free cash flow and a 
table of contents calculation of the conversion of net income with cash flows from continuing and discontinued operating activities twelve months ended december in thousands cash flow provided by operating activities capital expenditures proceeds from sale of property and equipment free cash flow net income conversion of net income in  we expect free cash flow to approximate million 
off balance sheet arrangements at december   we had no off balance sheet financing arrangements 
commitments and contingencies environmental we have been named as defendants  targets  or potentially responsible parties prps in a small number of environmental clean ups  in which our current or former business units have generally been given de minimis status 
to date  none of these claims have resulted in clean up costs  fines  penalties  or damages in an amount material to our financial position or results of operations 
we have disposed of a number of businesses over the last ten years and in certain cases  such as the disposition of the cross pointe paper corporation uncoated paper business in  the disposition of the federal cartridge company ammunition business in  the disposition of lincoln industrial in  and the disposition of the tools group in  we have retained responsibility and potential liability for certain environmental obligations 
we have received claims for indemnification from purchasers both of the paper business and the ammunition business and have established what we believe to be adequate accruals for potential liabilities arising out of retained responsibilities 
we settled some of the claims in and and our recorded accruals were adequate 
in addition  there are pending environmental issues at a limited number of sites  including one site acquired in the acquisition of essef corporation in  that relates to operations no longer carried out at that site 
we have established what we believe to be adequate accruals for remediation costs at this and other sites 
we do not believe that projected response costs will result in a material liability 
we may be named as a prp at other sites in the future  for both divested and acquired businesses 
when it is probable and it is possible to provide reasonable estimates of our liability with respect to environmental sites  provisions have been made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
as of december  and  our reserves for such environmental liabilities were approximately million and million  respectively  measured on an undiscounted basis 
we cannot ensure that environmental requirements will not change or become more stringent over time or that our eventual environmental clean up costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current reserves 
stand by letters of credit in the ordinary course of business  predominantly for contracts and bids involving municipal pump products  we are required to commit to bonds that require payments to our customers for any non performance 
the outstanding face value of the bonds fluctuates with the value of our projects in process and in our backlog 
in addition  we issue financial stand by letters of credit to secure our performance to third parties under self insurance programs and certain legal matters 
as of december   the outstanding value of these instruments totaled million 
as of december   the outstanding value of these instruments 
table of contents totaled million  which included a million stand by letter of credit pertaining to an indemnified legal matter that was resolved in our favor during  eliminating the bond requirement
