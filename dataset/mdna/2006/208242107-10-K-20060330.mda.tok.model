general we intend the following discussion and analysis to provide you with a better understanding of our financial condition and performance in the indicated periods  including an analysis of those key factors that contributed to our financial condition and performance and that are  or are expected to be  the key drivers of our business 
through our retail stores  we provide products and services to our customers in six primary market areas  including houston  san antonio austin  dallas fort worth  southern louisiana  southeast texas  and south texas 
products and services offered through retail sales outlets include major home appliances  consumer electronics  home office equipment  lawn and garden products  mattresses  furniture  service maintenance agreements  customer credit programs  including installment and revolving credit account services  and various credit insurance products 
these activities are supported through our extensive service  warehouse and distribution system 
our stores bear the conn s name  after our founder s family  and deliver the same products and services to our customers 
all of our stores follow the same procedures and methods in managing their operations 
the company s management evaluates performance and allocates resources based on the operating results of the retail stores and considers the credit programs  service contracts and distribution system to be an integral part of the company s retail operations 
presented below is a diagram setting forth our five cornerstones which represent  in our view  the five components of our sales goal strong merchandising systems  state of the art credit options for our customers  an extensive warehousing and distribution system  a service system to support our customers needs beyond the product warranty periods  and our uniquely  well trained employees in each area 
each of these systems combine to create a nuts and bolts support system for our customers needs and desires 
each of these systems is discussed at length in the business section of this report 
business cornerstones drive sales merchandising credit distribution service training we  of course  derive a large part of our revenue from our product sales 
however  unlike many of our competitors  we provide in house credit options for our customers product purchases 
in the last three years  we have financed  on average  approximately of our retail sales through these programs 
in turn  we finance convert to cash substantially all of our customer receivables from these credit options through an asset backed securitization facility 
see business finance operations for a detailed discussion of our in house credit programs 
as part of our asset backed securitization facility  we have created a qualifying special purpose entity  which we refer to as the qspe or the issuer  to purchase customer receivables from us and to issue asset backed and variable funding notes to third parties to fund such purchases 
we transfer our receivables  consisting of retail installment contracts and revolving accounts extended to our customers  to the issuer in exchange for cash and subordinated securities 
while our warehouse and distribution system does not directly generate revenues  other than the fees paid by our customers for delivery and installation of the products to their homes  it is our extra  value added program that our existing customers have come to rely on  and our new customers are hopefully sufficiently impressed with to become repeat customers 
we derive revenues from our repair services on the products we sell 
additionally  acting as an agent for unaffiliated companies  we sell credit insurance to protect our customers from credit losses due to death  disability  involuntary unemployment and damage to the products they have purchased  to the extent they do not already have it 
executive overview this overview is intended to provide an executive level overview of our operations for our fiscal year ended january  a detailed explanation of the changes in our operations for the fiscal year ended january  as compared to the prior year is included beginning on page following are significant financial items in managements view o our revenues for the fiscal year ended january  increased by percent  or million  from fiscal year to million due to sales growth  primarily from existing stores  and increased securitization income 
our same store sales product growth rate for the fiscal year ended january  was  versus for fiscal the improvement in same store sales growth was due primarily to improved execution at the store level and effective sales promotions 
also see operational changes and outlook 
o during the last half of fiscal year  two hurricanes  katrina and rita  hit the gulf coast 
these storms significantly impacted our operations by o temporary closing of our louisiana  south east texas  corpus christi and houston stores and related distribution operations for limited periods of time  o positively impacting net sales as customers in the affected areas replaced appliances and other household products damaged as a result of the storms  o disrupting credit collection efforts while we were displaced from our corporate headquarters as a result of hurricane rita  causing a short term increase in the credit portfolio s delinquency statistics and resulting in a reduction of finance charges and other and an increase in bad debt expense  and o causing us to incur expenses related to the relocation of our corporate office functions and losses related to damaged merchandise and facilities  net of insurance proceeds 
o same store sales benefited from the effects of the hurricanes 
appliance sales accounted for the majority of the increase in total same stores sales during the period due in part to our customers need to replace items damaged by the storms 
we believe same store sales  adjusted for our estimate of the impact of the hurricanes  grew approximately for the year ended january  o our entry into the dallas fort worth and the south texas markets had a positive impact on our revenues 
approximately million of our product sales for the year ended january   came from the opening of twelve new stores in these markets  since february our plans provide for the opening of additional stores in existing markets during the balance of fiscal as we focus on opportunities in markets in which we have existing infrastructure 
o while deferred interest and same as cash plans continue to be an important part of our sales promotion plans  our improved execution and effective use of a variety of sales promotions  enabled us to reduce the level of deferred interest and same as cash plans that extend beyond one year  relative to gross product sales volume 
for the fiscal years ended january  and  million and million  respectively  in gross product sales were financed by extended deferred interest and same as cash plans 
these extended term promotional programs were not offered broadly until april  we expect to continue to offer this type of extended term promotional credit in the future 
o during the year ended january   pretax income was reduced by million to reflect our estimate of expected losses due to increased delinquencies from hurricane rita and a temporary increase in bankruptcy filings 
the increase in bankruptcy filings is as a result of the new bankruptcy law that took effect october   prompting consumers to file for bankruptcy protection before the new law went into effect 
the million charge to earnings reduced finance charges and other by  and increased bad debt expense by  o our gross product margin was for fiscal year  a decrease from in fiscal  primarily as a result of a change in our revenue mix as product sales grew faster than service revenues and finance charges and other 
also  reduced insurance sales penetration negatively impacted our gross margin 
o our operating margin increased to from in fiscal in fiscal year  we decreased sg a expense as a percent of revenues to from when compared to the prior year  primarily from decreases in payroll and payroll related expenses and net advertising expense as a percent of revenues 
partially offsetting these reductions were increased general liability insurance expense and expenses incurred due to hurricane rita of approximately  net of estimated insurance proceeds 
additionally  our operating margin benefited from a decrease in the provision for bad debts as a percent of revenues from to o operating cash flows were million for fiscal our operating cash flows increased as a result of increased net income  improved funding under our asset backed securitization and vendor and federal employment and income tax payment deferrals granted because of the hurricanes 
most of the payments deferred will be paid during the three month period ended april  o our pretax income for fiscal increased by or approximately million  from fiscal to million 
the increase was driven largely by the increase in sales with additional benefit from improved expense leverage  as selling  general and administrative expenses did not grow as fast as revenues 
operational changes and outlook we have implemented  continued increased focus on or modified several initiatives in fiscal that we believe will positively impact our future operating results  including o a reorganization of our retail management team  including strengthening the district management team in the dallas fort worth market  o successfully increasing the sales force by adding approximately more sales associates per store  resulting in incremental sales volume  o implementation of call centers in the stores  emphasizing regular  consistent contact with our customers  o increased emphasis on the sales of furniture  and additional product lines added to this category  and o promoting flat panel technology in our stores as the price point becomes more affordable for our customers 
our sales during the last five months of fiscal benefited from the impact of hurricanes katrina and rita 
this impact could affect future same store sales due to o the acceleration of the sale of essential appliances in the affected markets disrupting the normal replacement o cycle for these items  and o the same store sales reported for the impacted markets being elevated to a level that might not be duplicated 
o while our credit portfolio delinquency statistics were still negatively impacted by the effects of the hurricanes at january   we anticipate the portfolio performance returning to historical levels as we continue to work with the customers impacted by these events 
during the year  we opened four new stores in the dallas fort worth market  one in harlingen  texas and one in san antonio  texas 
we continue to be satisfied with the results in the dallas fort worth market and will continue to expand the number of stores in that market 
we added additional distribution capability during the year by opening our  square foot distribution center in dallas  and increased our service center capabilities in dallas by converting our previous distribution center to a full time service center 
our new harlingen store now joins a store in mcallen  texas  opened in early september  forming our south texas market  we believe that this market is substantially underserved and provides great growth potential for our company 
we have several other locations in texas and louisiana that we believe are promising and  along with new stores in existing markets  are in various stages of development for opening in fiscal year we also continue to look at other markets  including neighboring states for opportunities 
the consumer electronics industry depends on new products to drive same store sales increases 
typically  these new products  such as digital televisions  dvd players  digital cameras and mp players are introduced at relatively high price points that are then gradually reduced as the product becomes more mainstream 
to sustain positive same store sales growth  unit sales must increase at a rate greater than the decline in product prices 
the affordability of the product helps drive the unit sales growth 
however  as a result of relatively short product life cycles in the consumer electronics industry  which limit the amount of time available for sales volume to increase  combined with rapid price erosion in the industry  retailers are challenged to maintain overall gross margin levels and positive same store sales 
this has historically been our experience  and we continue to adjust our marketing strategies to address this challenge through the introduction of new product categories and new products within our existing categories 
application of critical accounting policies in applying the accounting policies that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements  we necessarily make accounting estimates that affect our reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
some of these accounting estimates require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time we make the accounting estimates 
we base these assumptions and the resulting estimates on authoritative pronouncements  historical information and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  and we evaluate these assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis 
we could reasonably use different accounting estimates  and changes in our accounting estimates could occur from period to period  with the result in each case being a material change in the financial statement presentation of our financial condition or results of operations 
we refer to accounting estimates of this type as critical accounting estimates 
we believe that the critical accounting estimates discussed below are among those most important to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements as of january  transfers of financial assets 
we transfer customer receivables to the qspe that issues asset backed securities to third party lenders using these accounts as collateral  and we continue to service these accounts after the transfer 
we recognize the sale of these accounts when we relinquish control of the transferred financial asset in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities 
as we transfer the accounts  we record an asset representing the interest only strip  which is cash flows resulting entirely from the interest on the security 
the gain or loss recognized on these transactions is based on our best estimates of key assumptions  including forecasted credit losses  payment rates  forward yield curves  costs of servicing the accounts and appropriate discount rates 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different financial results 
for example  if we had assumed a reduction in net interest spread which might be caused by rising interest rates  our interest in securitized assets would have been reduced by million as of january   which may have an adverse effect on earnings 
we recognize income from our interest in these transferred accounts based on the difference between the interest earned on customer accounts and the costs associated with financing and servicing the transferred accounts  less a provision for bad debts associated with the transferred assets 
this income is recorded as finance charges and other in our consolidated statement of operations 
if we had assumed a increase in the assumption used for developing the reserve for doubtful accounts on the books of the qspe  the impact to recorded finance charges and other would have been a reduction in revenues and pretax income of million 
deferred tax assets 
we have significant net deferred tax assets approximately million as of january   which are subject to periodic recoverability assessments 
realization of our net deferred tax assets may be dependent upon whether we achieve projected future taxable income 
our estimates regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions  our ability to continue to execute at historical levels and our ability to continue our growth plans 
these changes  if any  may require material adjustments to these deferred tax asset balances 
for example  if we had assumed that the future tax rate at which these deferred items would reverse was rather than  we would have reduced the net deferred tax asset and net income by approximately  intangible assets 
we have significant intangible assets related primarily to goodwill 
the determination of related estimated useful lives and whether or not these assets are impaired involves significant judgments 
effective with the implementation of sfas  we ceased amortizing goodwill and began testing potential impairment of this asset annually based on judgments regarding ongoing profitability and cash flow of the underlying assets 
changes in strategy or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded asset balances 
for example  if we had reason to believe that our recorded goodwill had become impaired due to decreases in the fair market value of the underlying business  we would have to take a charge to income for that portion of goodwill that we believe is impaired 
our goodwill balance at january  and was million property  plant and equipment 
our accounting policies regarding land  buildings  and equipment include judgments regarding the estimated useful lives of such assets  the estimated residual values to which the assets are depreciated  and the determination as to what constitutes increasing the life of existing assets 
these judgments and estimates may produce materially different amounts of depreciation and amortization expense than would be reported if different assumptions were used 
these judgments may also impact the need to recognize an impairment charge on the carrying amount of these assets if the anticipated cash flows associated with the assets are not realized 
in addition  the actual life of the asset and residual value may be different from the estimates used to prepare financial statements in prior periods 
revenue recognition 
revenues from the sale of retail products are recognized at the time the product is delivered to the customer 
such revenues are recognized net of any adjustments for sales incentive offers such as discounts  coupons  rebates  or other free products or services 
we sell service maintenance agreements and credit insurance contracts on behalf of unrelated third parties 
for contracts where the third parties are the obligor on the contract  commissions are recognized in revenues at the time of sale  and in the case of retrospective commissions  based on claims experience  at the time that they are earned 
when we sell service maintenance agreements in which we are deemed to be the obligor on the contract at the time of sale  revenue is recognized ratably  on a straight line basis  over the term of the service maintenance agreement 
these direct obligor service maintenance agreements are renewal contracts that provide our customers protection against product repair costs arising after the expiration of the manufacturer s warranty and the third party obligor contracts and typically range from months to months 
these agreements are separate units of accounting under emerging issues task force no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the amounts of service maintenance agreement revenue deferred at january  and were million and million  respectively  and are included in deferred revenue in the accompanying balance sheets 
the amounts of service maintenance agreement revenue recognized for the fiscal years ended january   and were million  million and million  respectively 
vendor allowances 
we receive funds from vendors for price protection  product rebates  marketing and training and promotion programs which are recorded on the accrual basis as a reduction to the related product cost or advertising expense according to the nature of the program 
we accrue rebates based on the satisfaction of terms of the program and sales of qualifying products even though funds may not be received until the end of a quarter or year 
if the programs are related to product purchases  the allowances  credits or payments are recorded as a reduction of product cost  if the programs are related to promotion or marketing of the product  the allowances  credits  or payments are recorded as a reduction of advertising expense in the period in which the expense is incurred 
recent accounting pronouncements 
in december  statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment  was issued 
this statement establishes standards for accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services  focusing primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains an employee s services 
the statement requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments  based on the grant date fair value of the award  and record that cost over the period during which the employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
additionally  the statement provides multiple options for adopting the requirements of the standard 
we are required to implement the provisions of this statement effective february   and intend to elect to retrospectively adjust prior year results for comparison purposes 
we are required under existing accounting standards to provide supplemental disclosure in the footnotes to our financial statements as if our financial statements had been prepared using the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation 
see note to our financial statements for additional information 
accounting for leases 
the accounting for leases is governed primarily by sfas no 
 accounting for leases 
as required by the standard  we analyze each lease  at its inception  to determine whether it should be accounted for as an operating lease or a capital lease 
additionally  monthly lease expense for each operating lease is calculated as the average of all payments required under the minimum lease term  including rent escalations 
the minimum lease term begins with the date we take possession of the property and ends on the last day of the minimum lease term  and includes all rent holidays  but excludes renewal terms that are at our option 
any tenant improvement allowances received are deferred and amortized into income as a reduction of lease expense on a straight line basis over the minimum lease term 
the amortization of leasehold improvements is computed on a straight line basis over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful life of the improvements 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain statement of operations information as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated 
years ended january  revenues product sales service maintenance agreement commissions net service revenues total net sales finance charges and other total revenues cost and expenses cost of goods sold  including warehousing and occupancy costs cost of parts sold  including warehousing and occupancy costs selling  general and administrative expense provision for bad debts total costs and expenses operating income interest expense including minority interest 
earnings before income taxes provision for income taxes current deferred total provision for income taxes net income in reviewing the percentages reflected in the above table  we noted that the following trends in our operations developed within the last twelve months 
o the increase in cost of goods sold as a percentage of total revenues reflects the shift in revenue mix as product sales grew faster than service revenues and finance charges and other 
cost of products sold was of net product sales in the period and in the period 
o the decline in selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of total revenues resulted primarily from decreased payroll and payroll related expenses and net advertising expense  as a percent of revenues  that were partially offset by increased general liability insurance expense and higher expenses incurred due to hurricane rita 
o the declining trend in interest expense as a percentage of total revenues is a function of continuing to generate positive cash flow  the pay off of debt with our ipo proceeds in fiscal year and the impact of expiring interest rate swap agreements 
the presentation of our gross margins may not be comparable to other retailers since we include the cost of our in home delivery service as part of selling  general and administrative expense 
similarly  we include the cost of merchandising our products  including amounts related to purchasing the product and a portion of our advertising cost  in selling  general and administrative expense 
it is our understanding that other retailers may include such costs as part of cost of goods sold

year ended january  compared to the year ended january  revenues 
total revenues increased by million  or  from million for the year ended january  to million for the year ended january  the increase was attributable to increases in net sales of million  or  and million  or  in finance charges and other revenue 
the million increase in net sales was made up of the following o a million increase resulted from a same store sales increase of 
appliance sales accounted for the majority of the increase and were significantly impacted by our customers need to replace items damaged as a result of hurricanes katrina and rita 
after adjusting for our estimate of the impact of the storms  we believe same store sales increased approximately  with appliance  electronics  track and furniture sales being the biggest contributors 
as a result of changes in the commission structure on our third party service maintenance agreement sma contracts  beginning july  we began realizing the benefit of increased front end commissions on sma sales  which increased net sales million  offsetting this increase is a decrease in retrospective commissions which is reflected in finance charges and other  o a million increase generated by twelve retail locations that were not open for twelve consecutive months in each period  net of reductions related to the closing of one location  o a  decrease resulted from an increase in discounts on promotional credit sales  and o a million increase resulted from an increase in service revenues 
the components of the million increase in net sales were a million increase in product sales and an million net increase in service maintenance agreement commissions and service revenues 
the million increase in product sales resulted from the following o approximately million was attributable to increases in unit sales  due to increased appliances  track  furniture  and consumer electronics sales  and o approximately million was attributable to increases in unit price points 
the price point impact was driven primarily by o consumers selecting higher priced consumer electronics products  as the new technology becomes more affordable  o consumers selecting higher priced appliance products  including high efficiency washers and dryers and stainless kitchen o appliances  and higher prices on appliances in general 
the following table presents the makeup of net sales by product category in each period  including service maintenance agreement commissions and service revenues  expressed both in dollar amounts and as a percent of total net sales

provision for bad debts 
the provision for bad debts on receivables retained by the company and not transferred to the qspe and other non credit portfolio receivables decreased by million  or  during the year ended january  as compared to the year ended january   primarily as a result of changes in the loss history and provision adjustments based on favorable loss experience during the last twelve months  and revised loss allocations between receivables retained by us and those transferred to the qspe  which were offset in finance charges and other 
partially offsetting the bad debt expense decrease was a charge of  for estimated losses resulting from increased bankruptcy filings by our customers prior to october   the effective date of the new bankruptcy law and expected additional loan losses due to the impact of hurricane rita on our customers 
see note to the financial statements for information regarding the performance of the credit portfolio 
interest expense  net

net interest expense decreased by million  or  from million for the year ended january  to million for the year ended january  the net decrease in interest expense was attributable to the following factors o the expiration of million of our interest rate hedges in april and the expiration of million of our interest rate hedges in november and the discontinuation of hedge accounting for derivatives resulted in a net decrease of million in interest expense from the prior period  and o the decrease in our average outstanding debt from million to million when ignoring the impact of fin consolidation of million  see below as a result of our public offering and payoff of substantially all of our outstanding debt with the proceeds resulted in a decrease in interest expense of approximately million  these decreases were offset by the following o the increase in interest rates in our continuing revolving debt facilities and related commitment fees of  and o the implementation of fin resulted in reclassification of  in expenses previously reflected as occupancy cost in selling  general and administrative expense to interest expense  these reclassifications should not be necessary in the future since we are no longer subject to the provisions of fin minority interest 
as a result of fin  beginning february   we eliminate the pretax operating profit contributed from the consolidation of srds through the minority interest line item in our consolidated statement of operations 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes increased by million  or  from million for the year ended january  to million for the year ended january  the increase in the tax provision was directly related to the increase in pretax profits of million  or 
the effective tax rate attributable to continuing operations for the year ended january  was  compared with for the prior year 
taxes were comprised of federal and state rates totaling in both periods offset by cash refunds due to return amounts being lower than estimates and adjustments of previous tax provisions in both periods 
net income 
as a result of the above factors  net income increased million  or  from million for the year ended january  to million for the year ended january  impact of inflation we do not believe that inflation has a material effect on our net sales or results of operations 
however  a continuing significant increase in oil and gasoline prices could adversely affect our customers shopping decisions and patterns 
we rely heavily on our internal distribution system and our same or next day delivery policy to satisfy our customers needs and desires  and any such significant increases could result in increased distribution charges 
such increases may not affect our competitors in the same manner as it affects us 
seasonality and quarterly results of operations our business is somewhat seasonal  with a higher portion of sales and operating profit realized during the quarter that ends january the fiscal quarter ending january reflects the holiday selling season  the major collegiate bowl season  the national football league playoffs and the super bowl 
over the four quarters of fiscal  gross margins were   and 
during the same period  operating margins were   and 
a portion of the fluctuation in gross margins and operating margins is due to planned infrastructure cost additions  such as increased warehouse space and larger stores  additional personnel and systems required to absorb the significant increase in revenues that we have experienced over the last several years 
additionally  quarterly results may fluctuate materially depending on factors such as the following o timing of new product introductions  new store openings and store relocations  o sales contributed by new stores  o increases or decreases in comparable store sales  o adverse weather conditions  o shifts in the timing of certain holidays or promotions  and o changes in our merchandise mix 
results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full year

we have historically financed our operations through a combination of cash flow generated from operations and external borrowings  including primarily bank debt  extended terms provided by our vendors for inventory purchases  acquisition of inventory under consignment arrangements and transfers of receivables to our asset backed securitization facilities 
at january   we had a revolving line of credit facility with a group of lenders in the amount of million  under which we had no borrowings outstanding but utilized million of availability to issue letters of credit 
we expect that our cash requirements for the foreseeable future  including those for our capital expenditure requirements  will be met with our available line of credit and our existing million in cash and cash equivalents at january   together with cash generated from operations 
our current plans are to grow our store base by approximately a year 
we expect we will invest in real estate and customer receivables to support the additional stores and same store sales growth 
depending on market conditions we may  at times  enter into sale leaseback transactions to finance our real estate or seek alternative financing sources for new store expansions and customer receivables growth 
the following is a comparison of our statement of cash flows for our fiscal years and the increase in cash flow from operating activities for fiscal year from fiscal year of million  resulted primarily from increased net income  a smaller increase in the retained interest in the asset backed securitization program and the timing of payments of accounts payable and federal income and employment taxes 
operating cash flows have been positively impacted in the amount of approximately million by federal income and employment tax payment deadlines being deferred until february  after hurricane rita 
our promotional credit programs offered to certain customers provide for same as cash interest free periods of varying terms  generally three  six  twelve  eighteen  twenty four or thirty six months 
these promotional accounts are eligible for securitization up to of eligible securitized receivables 
the percentage of eligible securitized receivables represented by promotional receivables was  and as january   and  respectively 
to the extent we exceed the limit  or to the extent we have such promotional credit receivables that do not qualify for inclusion in the programs  we are required to use our other capital resources to fund the unpaid balance of the receivables for the promotional period 
the weighted average promotional period was and months for promotional receivables outstanding as of january  and january   respectively 
the weighted average remaining term on those same promotional receivables was and months  respectively 
while overall these promotional receivables have a much shorter average weighted life than non promotional receivables  we receive less income as a result of a reduced net interest margin used in the calculation of the gain on the sale of the receivables 
as a result  the existence of the interest free extended payment terms negatively impacts the gains or losses as compared to the other receivables  and results in a decrease in our available cash 
net cash used in investing activities was million for both fiscal year and fiscal year offsetting the million decline in purchases of property and equipment was a million decline in proceeds from sales of property and equipment 
included in fiscal purchase of property and equipment was million of purchases by srds  which was consolidated in our fiscal statement of cash flows 
the cash expended for property and equipment was used primarily for construction of new stores and the reformatting of existing stores to better support our current product mix 
we estimate that capital expenditures for the fiscal year will approximate million to million 
we lease of our stores  and our plans for future store locations include primarily leases  but does not exclude store ownership 
our capital expenditures for future store projects should primarily be for our tenant improvements to the property leased including any new distribution centers and warehouses  the cost of which is approximately million per store  and for our existing store remodels  in the range of  per store remodel  depending on store size 
in the event we purchase existing properties  our capital expenditures will depend on the particular property and whether it is improved when purchased 
we are continuously reviewing new relationship and funding sources and alternatives for new stores  which may include sale leaseback or direct purchase lease programs  as well as other funding sources for our purchase and construction of those projects 
if we are successful in these relationship developments  our direct cash needs should include only our capital expenditures for tenant improvements to leased properties and our remodel programs for existing stores  but could include full ownership if it meets our cash investment strategy 
net cash from financing activities decreased million from million for the year ended january   to a use of cash of million for the year ended january  this change resulted primarily from increases in payments on various debt instruments of million  as opposed to borrowings in the prior year of million 
partially offsetting the use of cash was increased proceeds from stock issued under employee benefit plans 
we do not expect to incur significant net borrowing or repayments under our bank credit facilities in fiscal on october   we entered into a new  expanded bank credit facility with the same group of banks that had provided the previous credit arrangement 
the new agreement expands the line of credit to million  from million  provides an accordion feature to allow further expansion of the facility to million  under certain conditions  and extends the maturity date to november  additionally  the facility provides sublimits of million for a swingline line of credit for faster advances on borrowing requests  and million for standby letters of credit 
loans under our revolving credit facility may  at our option  bear interest at either the alternate base rate  which is the greater of the administrative agent s prime rate or the federal funds rate  or the adjusted libo libor rate for the applicable interest period  in each case plus an applicable interest margin 
the interest margin is between and for base rate loans and between and for libo libor alternative rate loans 
the interest margin will vary depending on our debt coverage ratio 
we additionally pay commitment fees for the undrawn portion of our revolving credit facility 
at january  the interest rate on the revolving facility was

events of default under the credit facility include  subject to grace periods and notice provisions in certain circumstances  non payment of principal  interest or fees  violation of covenants  material inaccuracy of any representation or warranty  default under or acceleration of certain other indebtedness  bankruptcy and insolvency events  certain judgments and other liabilities  certain environmental claims  and a change of control 
if an event of default occurs  the lenders under the credit facility are entitled to take various actions  including accelerating amounts due under the credit facility and requiring that all such amounts be immediately paid in full 
our obligations under the credit facility are secured by all of our and our subsidiaries assets  excluding customer receivables owned by the qspe and certain inventory subject to vendor floor plan arrangements

there was million of letters of credit issued at january  included in accounts payable on the consolidated balance sheet as of january  since we extend credit in connection with a large portion of our retail  service maintenance and credit insurance sales  we created a qspe in to purchase customer receivables from us and to issue asset backed and variable funding notes to third parties to finance its purchase of these receivables 
we transfer receivables  consisting of retail installment contracts and revolving accounts extended to our customers  to the issuer in exchange for cash  subordinated securities and the right to receive the interest spread between the assets held by the qspe and the notes issued to third parties and our servicing fees 
the subordinated securities issued to us accrue interest based on prime rates and are subordinate to these third party notes both the bank credit facility and the asset backed securitization program are significant factors relative to our ongoing liquidity and our ability to meet the cash needs associated with the growth of our business 
our inability to use either of these programs because of a failure to comply with their covenants would adversely affect our continued growth 
funding of current and future receivables under the asset backed securitization program can be adversely affected if we exceed certain predetermined levels of re aging receivables  write offs  bankruptcies or other ineligible receivable amounts 
if the funding under the asset backed securitization program were reduced or terminated  we would have to draw down our bank credit facility more quickly than we have estimated 
a summary of the total receivables managed under the credit portfolio  including quantitative information about delinquencies  net credit losses and components of securitized assets  is presented in note to our consolidated financial statements 
based on current operating plans  we believe that cash provided by operating activities  available borrowings under our credit facility  access to the unfunded portion of the variable funding portion of our asset backed securitization program and our current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our operations  store expansion and updating activities and capital expenditure programs through at least january  however  there are several factors that could decrease cash provided by operating activities  including o reduced demand for our products  o more stringent vendor terms on our inventory purchases  o loss of ability to acquire inventory on consignment  o increases in product cost that we may not be able to pass on to our customers  o reductions in product pricing due to competitor promotional activities  o changes in inventory requirements based on longer delivery times of the manufacturers or other requirements which would negatively impact our delivery and distribution capabilities  o increases in the retained portion of our receivables portfolio under our current qspe s asset backed o securitization program as a result of changes in performance or types of receivables transferred promotional versus non promotional  o inability to expand our capacity for financing our receivables portfolio under new or replacement qspe o asset backed securitization programs or a requirement that we retain a higher percentage of the credit portfolio under such programs  o increases in the program costs interest and administrative fees relative to our receivables portfolio associated with the funding of our receivables  o increases in personnel costs required for us to stay competitive in our markets  and o our inability to obtain a relationship to provide the purchase of and financing of our capital expenditures for our new stores 
if cash provided by operating activities during this period is less than we expect or if we need additional financing for future growth  we may need to increase our revolving credit facility or undertake additional equity or debt offerings 
we may not be able to obtain such financing on favorable terms  if at all

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates under our bank credit facility are variable and are determined  at our option  as the base rate  which is the greater of prime rate or federal funds rate plus plus the base rate margin  which ranges from to  or libo libor plus the libo libor margin  which ranges from to 
accordingly  changes in the prime rate  the federal funds rate or libo libor  which are affected by changes in interest rates generally  will affect the interest rate on  and therefore our costs under  our bank credit facility 
we are also exposed to interest rate risk associated with our interest only strip and the subordinated securities we receive from our sales of receivables to the qspe 
see footnote to the audited financial statements for disclosures related to the sensitivity of the current fair value of the interest only strip and the subordinated securities to and adverse changes in the factors that affect these assets  including interest rates
