overview the company is a specialized commercial finance company that provides microticket equipment leasing and other financing services in amounts generally ranging from to  and an average lease term of months 
leasecomm historically financed contracts with an average amount financed of approximately  while the average amount financed by timepayment is approximately  the company s current portfolio consists of point of sale pos authorization systems and other small business equipment leased or rented to small commercial enterprises 
the company derives the majority of its revenues from leases originated and held by the company  payments on service contracts  rental payments  and fee income 
historically  the company has funded the majority of leases  contracts and loans through its revolving credit and term loan facilities the credit facilities and on balance sheet securitizations  and to a lesser extent  its subordinated debt program 
table of contents subordinated debt and internally generated funds 
between october and september  an interruption in the company s financing sources had a significant impact on its ability to fund new contracts 
as of september   the company s then existing credit facility failed to renew and the company began paying down the balance of the debt 
at december   the company was in default of certain of its debt covenants in its credit facility and securitization agreements 
these covenants required the company to maintain certain ratios of fixed charges to consolidated earnings  a minimum consolidated tangible net worth and compliance with a borrowing base 
in april  the company entered into a long term agreement with its lenders 
this long term agreement waived the defaults described above  and in consideration for the waiver  required the outstanding balance of the loan to be repaid over a term of months beginning in april at an interest rate of prime plus 
the company also received a waiver for the covenant violations in connection with the securitization agreement and amended the securitization agreement to conform its covenants to the covenants in the senior credit facility 
in october  the company was forced to suspend virtually all new contract originations until a new source of financing could be obtained or until such time as the credit facility had been paid in full 
in june  microfinancial secured a million credit facility  comprised of a one year million line of credit and a million three year subordinated note that enabled the company to resume microticket contract originations 
in conjunction with raising new capital  the company also formed a new wholly owned operating subsidiary  timepayment corp 
llc 
on september   microfinancial secured a three year  million  senior secured revolving line of credit from cit commercial services  a unit of cit group 
this line of credit replaced the previous one year  million line of credit obtained in june under more favorable terms and conditions 
in addition  it retired the existing outstanding debt with the former bank group 
the new financing has enabled the company to resume origination of contracts 
during the year ended december   the company began to actively increase its industry presence with a more focused and targeted sales and marketing effort 
the company continues to invest capital to build an infrastructure to support new sales and marketing initiatives  and has brought in new sales and marketing management to spearhead the effort 
in a typical lease transaction  the company originates leases through its network of independent dealers 
upon approval of a lease application by the company and verification that the lessee has both received the equipment and signed the lease  the company pays the dealer the cost of the equipment  plus the dealer s profit margin 
in a typical transaction for the acquisition of service contracts  a homeowner purchases a security system and simultaneously signs a contract with the dealer for the monitoring of that system for a monthly fee 
upon credit approval of the monitoring application and verification with the homeowner that the system is installed  the company purchases from the dealer the right to the payment stream under that monitoring contract at a negotiated multiple of the monthly payments 
substantially all leases originated or acquired by the company are non cancelable 
during the term of the lease  the company is scheduled to receive payments sufficient  in the aggregate  to cover the company s borrowing costs and the costs of the underlying equipment  and to provide the company with an appropriate profit 
the company enhances the profitability of its leases  contracts and loans by charging late fees  prepayment penalties  loss and damage waiver fees and other service fees  when applicable 
collection fees are imposed based on the company s estimate of the costs of collection 
the company may only impose late fees on the first four months of late payments and is prohibited from imposing compound late fees or from assessing late fees as a percentage of the total outstanding late payments including outstanding late fees 
the loss and damage waiver fees are charged if a customer fails to provide proof of insurance and are reasonably related to the cost of replacing the lost or damaged equipment or product 
the initial non cancelable term of the lease is equal to or less than the equipment s estimated economic life and often provides the company with additional revenues based on the residual value of the equipment financed at the end of the initial term of the lease 
initial terms of the leases in the company s portfolio generally range from to months  with an average initial term of months as of december  
table of contents critical accounting policies in response to the sec s release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  management identified the most critical accounting principles upon which our financial status depends 
the company determined the critical principles by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments 
the company identified its most critical accounting policies to be those related to revenue recognition  maintaining the allowance for credit losses  determining provisions for income taxes and accounting for share based compensation 
these accounting policies are discussed below as well as within the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company s lease contracts are accounted for as financing leases 
at origination  the company records the gross lease receivable  the estimated residual value of the leased equipment  initial direct costs incurred and the unearned lease income 
unearned lease income is the amount by which the gross lease receivable plus the estimated residual value exceeds the cost of the equipment 
unearned lease income and initial direct costs incurred are amortized over the related lease term using the interest method 
amortization of unearned lease income and initial direct costs is suspended if  in the opinion of management  full payment of the contractual amount due under the lease agreement is doubtful 
in conjunction with the origination of leases  the company may retain a residual interest in the underlying equipment upon termination of the lease 
the value of such interest is estimated at inception of the lease and evaluated periodically for impairment 
at the end of the lease term  the lessee has the option to buy the equipment at a price quoted by the company  return the equipment or continue to rent the equipment on a month to month basis 
if the lessee continues to rent the equipment  the company records an investment in the rental contract at its estimated residual value 
rental revenue and depreciation are recognized based on the methodology described below 
other revenues such as loss and damage waiver fees  and service fees relating to the leases  contracts and loans are recognized as they are earned 
the company s investments in cancelable service contracts are recorded at cost and amortized over the expected life of the service period 
income on service contracts from monthly billings is recognized as the related services are provided 
the company periodically evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that may affect the estimated useful life or recoverability of the investment in service contracts 
the company s investment in rental contracts is either recorded at estimated residual value and depreciated using the straight line method over a period of months or at the acquisition cost and depreciated using the straight line method over a period of months 
rental income from monthly billings is recognized as the customer continues to rent the equipment 
the company periodically evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that may affect the estimated useful life or recoverability of the investment in rental contracts 
loans are reported at their outstanding principal balance 
interest income on loans is recognized as it is earned 
allowance for credit losses the company maintains an allowance for credit losses on its investment in leases  service contracts  rental contracts and loans at an amount that it believes is sufficient to provide adequate protection against losses in its portfolio 
given the nature of the microticket market and the individual size of each transaction  the business does not warrant the creation of a formal credit review committee to review individual transactions 
rather  we developed a sophisticated  risk adjusted pricing model and have automated the credit scoring  approval and collection processes 
we believe that with the proper risk adjusted pricing model  we can grant credit to a wide range of applicants provided we have priced appropriately for the associated risk inherent in the transaction 
as a result of approving a wide range of credits  we experience a relatively high level of delinquency and write offs in our portfolio 
during periods where we are making credit decisions and funding new transactions  it is important for us to periodically review the credit scoring and approval process to ensure that the automated system is making appropriate credit decisions 
given the nature of the microticket market and the individual size of each transaction  the business does not warrant evaluating transactions individually for the purpose of developing and determining the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses 

table of contents contracts in our portfolio are not re graded subsequent to the initial extension of credit nor is the reserve allocated to specific contracts 
rather  we view the impaired contracts to have common characteristics and maintain a general allowance against our entire portfolio utilizing historical statistics for recovery and timing of recovery as the basis for the amount 
the company has adopted a consistent  systematic procedure for establishing and maintaining an appropriate reserve for credit losses for the microticket transactions 
management reviews  on a static pool basis  the collection experience on various months originations 
in addition management also reviews  on a static pool basis  the recoveries made on written off accounts 
the results of these static pool analyses reflect the company s actual collection experience given the fact that the company obtains additional recourse in many instances in the form of personal guaranties from the borrowers  as well as  in some instances  limited recourse from the dealer 
in addition  management considers current delinquency statistics  current economic conditions  and other relevant factors 
the combination of historical experience and the review of current factors provide the basis for the analysis to determine the adequacy of the reserves 
the company takes charge offs against its receivables when such receivables are days past due and no contact has been made with the lessee for months 
historically  the typical monthly payment under the company s leases has been between and per month 
as a result of these small monthly payments  the company s experience is that lessees will pay past due amounts later in the process because of the small amount necessary to bring an account current at days past due  a lessee may only owe lease payments of between and 
income taxes significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any necessary valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
the process involves summarizing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items  for example  leases  for tax and accounting purposes 
in addition  the calculation of the company s tax liabilities involves dealing with estimates in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions 
differences between the basis of assets and liabilities result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are recorded on the balance sheet 
management must then assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income or tax carry back availability and to the extent management believes recovery is more likely than not  no valuation allowance is deemed necessary 
the company is currently undergoing an audit of its through tax years 
as part of the audit  the internal revenue service agent has proposed several adjustments to the annual tax returns  which if final  would require the company to pay the irs an amount between and million 
such payments would be offset by an adjustment to the deferred tax asset such that the amount would likely be recoverable in future periods 
the company has several defenses to these adjustments and has filed a formal response under the appeals process challenging these adjustments 
the company can give no assurance that it will be successful in any appeal procedure 
share based compensation as of january   the company adopted sfas r  which requires the measurement of compensation cost for all outstanding unvested share based awards at fair value and recognition of compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest 
the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment  and to the extent actual results differ from our estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised 
actual results may differ substantially from these estimates 
the company estimates the fair value of stock options using a black scholes valuation model  consistent with the provisions of sfas r  securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin no 
and the company s prior period pro forma disclosures of net earnings  including stock based compensation determined under a fair value method as prescribed by sfas 
key input assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock options include the grant price of the award  the expected option term  volatility of the company s stock  the risk free interest rate and the company s dividend yield 
estimates of fair value are not intended to predict actual future events or the value 
table of contents ultimately realized by employees who receive equity awards  and subsequent events are not indicative of the reasonableness of the original estimates of fair value made by the company under sfas r 
results of operations revenue change change in thousands income on financing leases and loans rental income income on service contracts service fees and other total revenues the company s lease contracts are accounted for as financing leases 
at origination  the company records the gross lease receivable  the estimated residual value of the leased equipment  initial direct costs incurred and the unearned lease income 
unearned lease income is the amount by which the gross lease receivable plus the estimated residual value exceeds the cost of the equipment 
unearned lease income and initial direct costs incurred are amortized over the related lease term using the interest method 
other revenues such as loss and damage waiver fees  service fees relating to the leases  contracts and loans  and rental revenues are recognized as they are earned 
total revenues for the year ended december   were million  a decrease of million  or  from the year ended december   due primarily to decreases of million  or  in income on financing leases and loans and million  or  in service fee and other income 
in addition  rental revenue decreased million or and income on service contracts decreased million  or  as compared to such amounts in the prior year 
the decrease in income on financing leases and loans was due to the decreased number of leases originated primarily resulting from the company s decision during the third quarter of to suspend the funding of new contracts 
the decrease in fee income and other income is the result of decreased fees from the lessees related to the collection and legal process employed by the company 
the decrease in rental and service contract income is a result of the decreased number of lessees that have continued to rent their equipment beyond their original lease term  and decreased originations in rental and service contracts 
revenues are expected to continue to decline until such time as new originations begin to outpace the rate of attrition of contracts in the existing portfolio 
total revenues for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of million  or  from the year ended december  the decline in revenue was due to decreases of million  or  in income on financing leases and loans and million  or  in service fee and other income 
in addition  rental revenue decreased million or and income on service contracts decreased million  or  as compared to such amounts in the previous year s period 
the overall decrease in revenue can be attributed to the decrease in the overall size of the company s portfolio of leases  rentals and service contracts

the provision was based on the company s historical policy of providing a provision for credit losses based upon dealer funding and revenue recognized in the period  as well as taking into account actual and expected losses in the portfolio as a whole and the relationship of the allowance to the net investment in leases  service contracts  rental contracts and loans

the company s accounting policy for recording and depreciating rental equipment under operating 
table of contents leases depends upon the source of the rental contract 
certain rental contracts are originated as a result of the renewal provisions of the lease agreement whereby at the end of lease term  the customer may elect to continue to rent the leased equipment on a month to month basis 
these contracts are recorded at their residual value and depreciated over a term of months 
this term represents our estimated life of a previously leased piece of equipment and is based upon our historical experience 
in the event the contract terminates prior to the end of the month period  the remaining net book value is expensed as an impairment charge 
the company also offers a financial product where the customer may acquire a new piece of equipment and sign a rental agreement  which allows the customer  assuming the contract is current and no event of default exists  to terminate the contract at any time by returning the equipment and providing the company with days notice 
these contracts are recorded at acquisition cost and depreciated over an average contract life of months 
this term is an estimate based upon our historical experience 
in the event that the contract terminates prior to the end of the month period  the remaining net book value is expensed as an impairment charge 
service contracts are recorded at cost and amortized over their estimated life of months 
in a typical service contract acquisition  a homeowner will purchase a home security system and simultaneously sign a contract with the security dealer for the monitoring of that system for a monthly fee 
the security dealer will then sell the rights to that monthly payment to the company 
we perform all of the processing  billing  collection and administrative work on these transactions 
the estimated life of months for service contracts is based upon the standard expected life of such contracts in the security monitoring industry and has also proven to be accurate based upon historical performance of our monitoring portfolios

table of contents exposure to credit losses the following table sets forth certain information as of december   and with respect to delinquent leases  service contracts and loans 
the percentages in the table below represent the aggregate on such date of the actual amounts not paid on each invoice by the number of days past due  rather than the entire balance of a delinquent receivable  over the cumulative amount billed at such date from the date of origination on all leases  service contracts  and loans in the company s portfolio 
for example  if a receivable is days past due  the portion of the receivable that is over days past due will be placed in the days past due category  the portion of the receivable which is over days past due will be placed in the days past due category and the portion of the receivable which is over days past due will be placed in the over days past due category 
the company historically used this methodology of calculating its delinquencies because of its experience that lessees who miss a payment do not necessarily default on the entire lease 
accordingly  the company includes only the amount past due rather than the entire lease receivable in each category 
as of december  dollars in thousands cumulative amounts billed days past due days past due over days past due total past due alternatively  the amounts in the table below represent the balance of delinquent receivables on an exposure basis for all leases  rental contracts  and service contracts in the company s portfolio as of december  an exposure basis aging classifies the entire receivable based on the invoice that is the most delinquent 
for example  in the case of a rental or service contract  if a receivable is days past due  all amounts billed and unpaid are placed in the over days past due category 
in the case of lease receivables  where the minimum contractual obligation of the lessee is booked as a receivable at the inception of the lease  if a receivable is days past due  the entire receivable  including all amounts billed and unpaid as well as the minimum contractual obligation yet to be billed  will be placed in the over days past due category 
december  december  dollars in thousands current days past due days past due over days past due gross receivables due in installments liquidity and capital resources general the company s lease and finance business is capital intensive and requires access to substantial short term and long term credit to fund new lease originations 
since inception  the company has funded its operations primarily through borrowings under its credit facilities  its on balance sheet securitizations  the issuance of subordinated debt and an initial public offering completed in february the company will continue to require significant additional capital to maintain and expand its volume of leases and contracts funded  as well as to fund any future acquisitions of leasing companies or portfolios 
in the near term  the company expects to finance the business utilizing its cash on hand and its line of credit 
additionally  the company s uses of cash include the payment of interest expenses  repayment of borrowings under its credit

the company repaid million of debt in the year ended december  and million of debt in the year ended december  in addition  we repaid debt of million and paid dividends of million in the year ended december  the company believes that cash flows from its existing portfolio and available borrowings on the existing credit facility will be sufficient to support the company s operations and lease origination activity for the foreseeable future 
borrowings the company utilizes its credit facilities to fund the origination and acquisition of leases that satisfy the eligibility requirements established pursuant to each facility 
borrowings outstanding under the company s revolving credit facilities and long term debt consist of the following as of december  as of december  maximum amounts amounts unused facility outstanding interest rate outstanding interest rate capacity amount dollars in thousands revolving credit facility subordinated notes the unused capacity is subject to lease eligibility and the borrowing base formula subordinated notes are generally one time fundings  without any ability for the company to draw down additional amounts 
on september   the company entered into a three year senior secured revolving line of credit with cit commercial services  a unit of cit group cit  whereby it may borrow a maximum of million based upon qualified lease receivables 
outstanding borrowings with respect to the revolving line of credit bear interest based at prime plus for prime rate loans  or the prevailing rate per annum as offered in the london interbank offered rate libor plus for libor loans

as of december   based on lease eligibility and the borrowing base formula  the company had million in excess availability on the cit line of credit 

table of contents prior to obtaining the million secured line of credit discussed above  the company had borrowings outstanding under a million senior credit facility with a group of financial institutions  which had failed to renew as of september  while cash flows from its portfolio and other fees had been sufficient to repay amounts borrowed under the senior credit facility  securitizations and subordinated debt  in october  the company was forced to suspend virtually all new contract originations until a new source of liquidity was obtained or until such time as the senior credit facility was paid in full 
at december   the company was in default of certain of its debt covenants in its senior credit facility 
these covenants required that the company maintain certain ratios of fixed charges to consolidated earnings  a minimum consolidated tangible net worth  and compliance with a borrowing base 
on april   the company entered into a long term agreement with its lenders in which the lenders waived the defaults described above and the company agreed to repay the outstanding balance of the loan over a term of months beginning in april at an interest rate of prime plus 
as of december   the loan under the senior credit facility had been fully repaid 
the company  through its wholly owned subsidiaries  periodically finances its lease and service contracts  together with unguaranteed residuals  through securitizations using special purpose entities 
the assets of such special purpose entities and cash collateral or other accounts created in connection with the financings in which they participate are not available to pay creditors of leasecomm corporation  timepayment corp  llc  microfinancial incorporated  or other affiliates 
however  the special purpose entities are required to be consolidated in the financial statements of the company under generally accepted accounting principles 
as a result  such assets and the related liability remain on the balance sheet and do not receive gain on sale treatment 
the amounts borrowed under the securitization were fully repaid as of december  financial covenants the company s secured revolving line of credit with cit has financial covenants that it must comply with in order to obtain funding through the facility and to avoid an event of default 
some of the critical financial covenants under the cit line of credit as of december  and include consolidated tangible capital funds not less than million allowance for credit losses of at least of gross lease installments maximum leverage ratio of not more than as of december  and  management believes that the company was in compliance with all covenants in its borrowing relationships 
contractual obligations  commercial commitments and contingencies the company has entered into various agreements  such as long term debt agreements  capital lease agreements and operating lease agreements that require future payments be made 
long term debt agreements include all debt outstanding under the securitization  subordinated notes  demand notes and other notes payable

the company s commitment to lend  however  does not become binding until all of the steps in the lease origination process have been completed  including but not limited to the receipt of a complete and accurate lease document and all required supporting information and successful verification with the lessee 
since the company funds on the same day a lease is successfully verified  at any given time  the company has no firm outstanding commitments to lend 
contingencies the company is currently undergoing an audit of its through tax years 
as part of the audit  the internal revenue service agent has proposed several adjustments to the annual tax returns  which if final  would require the company to pay the irs an amount between and million 
such payments would be offset by an adjustment to the deferred tax asset such that the amount would likely be recoverable in future periods 
the company has several defenses to these adjustments and has filed a formal response under the appeals process challenging these adjustments 
the company can give no assurance that it will be successful in any appeal procedure 
market risk and financial instruments the following discussion about the company s risk management activities includes forward looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
this analysis presents the hypothetical loss in earnings  cash flows  and fair value of the financial instruments held by the company at december   that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
in the normal course of operations  the company also faces risks that are either non financial or non quantifiable 
such risks principally include credit risk  and legal risk  and are not represented in the analysis that follows 
the implicit yield to the company on all of its leases  contracts and loans is on a fixed interest rate basis due to the leases  contracts and loans having scheduled payments that are fixed at the time of origination of the lease 
when the company originates or acquires leases  contracts and loans it bases its pricing in part on the spread it expects to achieve between the implicit yield rate to the company on each lease and the effective interest cost it will pay when it finances such leases  contracts and loans through its credit facility 
increases in interest rates during the term of each lease  contract or loan could narrow or eliminate the spread  or result in a 
table of contents negative spread 
the company has adopted a policy designed to protect itself against interest rate volatility during the term of each lease  contract or loan 
given the relatively short average life of the company s leases  contracts and loans  the company s goal is to maintain a blend of fixed and variable interest rate obligations 
currently  given the restrictions imposed by the company s senior lender on the company s ability to prepay its fixed rate debt  the company is limited in its ability to manage the blend of fixed and variable rate interest obligations 
as of december   the company s outstanding fixed rate indebtedness outstanding under the company s subordinated debt represented of the company s total outstanding indebtedness of million 
the company s credit facility bears interest at rates which fluctuate with changes in the prime rate or the day libor 
the company s interest expense on its credit facility and the fair value of its fixed rate debt are sensitive to changes in market interest rates 
the effect of a adverse change in market interest rates  sustained for one year  on the company s interest expense and the fair value of its fixed rate debt would be immaterial 
the company maintains an investment portfolio in accordance with its investment policy guidelines 
the primary objectives of the investment guidelines are to preserve capital  maintain sufficient liquidity to meet our operating needs  and to maximize return 
the company minimizes investment risk by limiting the amount invested in any single issuance and by focusing on conservative investment choices with short terms and high credit quality standards 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments nor does it invest for speculative trading purposes 
recently issued accounting pronouncements see note b of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein for a discussion of the impact of the adoption of sfas no 
r  share based payment  effective january  risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the securities and exchange commission are risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward looking statements contained in this report and other periodic statements we make 
we depend on external financing to fund new leases and contracts  and adequate financing may not be available to us in amounts  together with our cash flow  sufficient both to originate new leases and to service our debt 
our lease and finance business is capital intensive and requires access to substantial short term and long term credit to fund new leases  contracts and loans 
we will continue to require significant additional capital to maintain and expand our volume of leases  contracts and loans funded  as well as to fund any future acquisitions of leasing companies or portfolios 
in addition  until recently we were required to pay down our existing debt under our former credit facility according to an agreed schedule 
as of september   our credit facility failed to renew and consequently  we were forced to suspend substantially all new origination activity in october at december   we were in default of certain of our debt covenants in our then existing credit facility 
these covenants required that we maintain a certain ratio of fixed charges to consolidated earnings  a minimum consolidated tangible net worth  and compliance with a borrowing base 
on april   we entered into a long term agreement with our former lenders which waived the defaults described above  and in consideration for this waiver  required the outstanding balance of the loan to be repaid over a term of months beginning in april in june  we secured a million credit facility  comprised of a one year million line of credit and a million three year subordinated note that enabled us to resume microticket contract originations 
in conjunction with raising new capital  we formed a wholly owned operating subsidiary  timepayment 
table of contents corp 
llc 
on september   we secured a three year  million  senior secured revolving line of credit from cit commercial services  a unit of cit group 
this line of credit replaced the previous one year  million line of credit obtained in june under more favorable terms and conditions  including  but not limited to  pricing at prime plus or libor plus 
in addition  it retired the remaining outstanding debt with our former lenders 
our uses of cash include the origination and acquisition of leases  contracts and loans  payment of interest expenses  repayment of borrowings under our credit facilities  subordinated debt and securitizations  payment of selling  general and administrative expenses  income taxes and capital expenditures 
any default or other interruption of our external funding could have a material negative effect on our ability to fund new leases and contracts  and would have an adverse effect on our financial results 
the delay in new originations caused by our former credit facility s failure to renew in has decreased the size of our portfolio and may continue to adversely affect our financial performance 
as a result of the failure of our old credit facility to renew  in october  we were forced to suspend virtually all new contract originations until we obtained a source of funding or the senior credit facility was paid in full 
during the first half of  we were able to fund a very limited number of new contracts using our own free cash flow 
the amount and timing of the new originations was restricted by both the amount of available cash  and the terms of our banking agreements 
for example  total revenues for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of million  or  from the year ended december  the decline in revenue was due to decreases of million  or  in income on financing leases and loans and million  or  in service fee and other income 
in addition  rental revenue decreased million or and income on service contracts decreased million  or  as compared to such amounts in the previous year s period 
the overall decrease in revenue can be attributed to the decrease in the overall size of our portfolio of leases  rentals and service contracts 
the shrinking portfolio is a direct result of our decision during the third quarter of to cease funding new originations as a result of our former lenders not renewing the revolving credit facility on september  our recently signed credit facilities in june and september have enabled us to resume contract originations 
however  our contract originations may be constrained by the amount of financing available and this may have an adverse affect on our revenues 
even if we have the funding to originate new contracts  the absence of new contract origination from the period beginning in the third quarter of will have an affect on our portfolio and financial performance for some time  since we will not be collecting any payments from leases  contracts and loans that may have originated during that time had there been financing available 
as the average age of the outstanding loans in our loan portfolio increased during that period  a greater portion of payments being made on those loans consisted of principal payments  and a lesser portion consisted of interest  which adversely impacts our revenue 
this is reflected in our results for  as our income on financing leases and loans decreased by over  even though our dealer funding increased by over it may take some time before the new contract and loan originations bring our loan portfolio s average age to the point where it was before we suspended new originations 
in addition  after we ceased funding new originations in  we were required to terminate a number of our front end personnel  such as sales personnel  sales support personnel and credit personnel 
as we begin to originate new contracts and loans in light of our new credit facilities  we may face challenges in rebuilding those competencies through new hires 
we are vulnerable to changes in the demand for the types of systems we lease or price reductions in such systems 
the majority of our leases are currently for authorization systems for point of sale pos  card based payments by  for example  debit  credit and charge cards 
we also lease a wide variety of other equipment including advertising and display equipment  coffee machines  paging systems  water coolers and restaurant equipment 
reduced demand for financing of these types of equipment  in particular pos authorization systems  could adversely affect our lease volume  which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our 
table of contents business  financial condition and results of operations 
technological advances may lead to a decrease in the price of these types of systems or equipment and a consequent decline in the need for financing of such equipment 
in addition  for pos authorization systems  business and technological changes could change the manner in which pos authorization is obtained 
these changes could reduce the need for outside financing sources that would reduce our lease financing opportunities and origination volume in such products 
in the event that demand for financing pos authorization systems or other types of equipment that we lease declines  we will need to expand our efforts to provide lease financing for other products 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will be able to do so successfully 
because many dealers specialize in particular products  we may not be able to capitalize on our current dealer relationships in the event we shift our business focus to originating leases of other products 
our failure to successfully enter into new relationships with dealers of other products or to extend existing relationships with such dealers in the event of reduced demand for financing of the systems and equipment we currently lease would have a material adverse effect on us 
even if we had adequate financing  our expansion strategy may be affected by our limited sources for new originations and our inexperience with lending for new products 
our revenue growth since the third quarter of has been severely affected by the failure of our former credit facility to renew and a lack of new financing prior to june even with our new long term line of credit  our principal growth strategy of expansion into new products and markets may be adversely affected by i our inability to re establish old sources or cultivate new sources of originations and ii our inexperience with products with different characteristics from those we currently offer  including the type of obligor and the amount financed 
new sources 
a majority of our leases and contracts were historically originated through a network of dealers  which deal exclusively in pos authorization systems 
we are currently unable to capitalize on these relationships in originating leases for products other than pos authorization systems 
in addition  we have lost contacts with some of our old sources during the time we had suspended new originations 
some of these dealers have found other financing sources during that time 
we may face difficulties in re establishing our relationships with such sources 
our failure to develop additional relationships with dealers of products  which we lease or may seek to lease would hinder our growth strategy 
new products 
our existing portfolio primarily consists of leases to owner operated or other small commercial enterprises with little business history and limited or challenged personal credit history at the owner level 
these leases are characterized by small average monthly payments for equipment with limited residual value at the end of the lease term 
our ability to successfully underwrite new products with different characteristics is highly dependent on our ability i to successfully analyze the credit risk associated with the user of such new products so as to appropriately apply our risk adjusted pricing to such products and ii to utilize our proprietary software to efficiently service and collect on our portfolio 
we can give no assurance that we will be able to successfully manage these credit risk issues  which could have a material adverse effect on us 
we experience a significant rate of default under our leases  and a higher than expected default rate would have an adverse affect on our cash flow and earnings 
the credit characteristics of our lessee base correspond to a high incidence of delinquencies  which in turn may lead to significant levels of defaults 
our receivables which were contractually past due by days or more at december  and represented million and million  respectively  which represented and  respectively  of the cumulative amount billed at that date from the date of origination on all leases  service contracts and loans in our portfolio 
receivables which were over days past due represented and  respectively  of such cumulative amounts at that date 
the credit profile of our lessees heightens the importance to us of both pricing our leases  loans and contracts for risk assumed  as well as maintaining adequate reserves for losses 
significant defaults by lessees in excess of those we anticipate in setting our prices and reserve levels may adversely affect our cash flow and earnings 
reduced cash flow and earnings could limit our ability to repay debt  obtain financing and effect securitizations  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents in addition to our usual practice of originating leases through our dealer relationships  from time to time we have purchased lease portfolios from dealers 
while certain of these leases at inception would not have met our underwriting standards  we often will purchase the leases once the lessee demonstrates a payment history 
we will only acquire these smaller lease portfolios in situations where the company selling the portfolio will continue to act as a dealer following the acquisition 
we have also completed the acquisition of six large pos authorization system lease and rental portfolios two in  one in  one in  one in and the acquisition of the rental and lease portfolio of resource leasing in we may face adverse consequences of litigation  including consequences of using litigation as part of our collection policy 
our use of litigation as a means of collection of unpaid receivables exposes us to counterclaims on our suits for collection  to class action lawsuits and to negative publicity surrounding our leasing and collection policies 
we have been a defendant in attempted class action suits as well as counterclaims filed by individual obligors in attempts to dispute the enforceability of the lease  contract or loan 
any of this type of litigation may be time consuming and expensive to defend  even if not meritorious  may result in the diversion of management time and attention  and may subject us to significant liability for damages or result in invalidation of our proprietary rights 
we believe our collection policies and use of litigation comply fully with all applicable laws 
because of our persistent enforcement of our leases  contracts and loans through the use of litigation  we may have created ill will toward us on the part of certain lessees and other obligors who were defendants in such lawsuits 
our litigation strategy has generated adverse local publicity in certain circumstances 
adverse publicity at a national level could negatively impact public perception of our business and may materially impact the price of our common stock 
any of these factors could adversely affect our business operations and financial results and condition 
in addition to legal proceedings that may arise out of our business activities  we may face other litigation 
in october  we were served with a purported class action complaint  which was filed in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts alleging violations of federal securities law 
the purported class would consist of all persons who purchased our securities between february  and october  the complaint asserts that during this period we made a series of materially false or misleading statements about our business  prospects and operations  including with respect to certain lease provisions  our course of dealings with our vendor dealers  and our reserves for credit losses 
in april  an amended class action complaint was filed which added additional defendants and expanded upon the prior allegations with respect to us 
we filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint  which is awaiting decision by the court 
because of the uncertainties inherent in litigation  we cannot predict whether the outcome will have a material adverse effect on us 
increased interest rates may make our leases  contracts or loans less profitable 
since we generally fund our leases  contracts and loans through our credit facilities or from working capital  our operating margins could be adversely affected by an increase in interest rates 
the implicit yield to us on all of our leases  contracts and loans is fixed due to the leases  contracts and loans having scheduled payments that are fixed at the time of origination 
when we have in the past originated or acquired leases  contracts and loans  we based our pricing in part on the spread we expect to achieve between the implicit yield rate to us on each lease  contract and loan and the effective interest cost we will pay when we finance such leases  contracts and loans 
increases in interest rates during the term of each lease  contract and loan could narrow or eliminate the spread  or result in a negative spread  to the extent such lease  contract or loan was financed with floating rate funding 
we may undertake to hedge against the risk of interest rate increases  based on the size and interest rate profile of our portfolio 
such hedging activities  however  would limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower interest rates with respect to the hedged portfolio 
in addition  our hedging activities may not protect us from interest rate related risks in all interest rate environments 
adverse developments resulting from changes in interest rates or hedging transactions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents an economic downturn may cause an increase in defaults under our leases and lower demand for the commercial equipment we lease 
further economic downturn could result in a decline in the demand for some of the types of equipment or services  which we finance  which could lead to additional defaults and to a decline in future originations 
an economic downturn may slow the development and continued operation of small commercial businesses  which are the primary market for pos authorization systems and the other commercial equipment leased by us 
such a downturn could also adversely affect our ability to obtain capital to fund lease  contract and loan originations or acquisitions or to complete securitizations 
in addition  such a downturn could result in an increase in delinquencies and defaults by our lessees and other obligors beyond the levels forecasted by us  which could have an adverse effect on our cash flow and earnings  as well as on our ability to securitize leases 
these results could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  as of both december  and  leases in california  florida  texas  massachusetts and new york accounted for approximately of our portfolio 
economic conditions in these states may affect the level of collections from  as well as delinquencies and defaults by  these obligors 
we face intense competition  which could cause us to lower our lease rates  hurt our origination volume and strategic position and adversely affect our financial results 
the microticket leasing and financing industry is highly competitive 
we compete for customers with a number of national  regional and local banks and finance companies 
our competitors also include equipment manufacturers that lease or finance the sale of their own products 
while the market for microticket financing has traditionally been fragmented  we could also be faced with competition from small or large ticket leasing companies that could use their expertise in those markets to enter and compete in the microticket financing market 
our competitors include larger  more established companies  some of which may possess substantially greater financial  marketing and operational resources than we  including lower cost of funds and access to capital markets and to other funding sources  which may be unavailable to us 
if a competitor were to lower lease rates  we could be forced to follow suit or be unable to regain origination volume  either of which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  competitors may seek to replicate the automated processes used by us to monitor dealer performance  evaluate lessee credit information  appropriately apply risk adjusted pricing  and efficiently service a nationwide portfolio 
the development of computer software similar to that developed by us by or for our competitors may jeopardize our strategic position and allow such companies to operate more efficiently than we do 
government regulation could restrict our business 
our leasing business is not currently subject to extensive federal or state regulation 
while we are not aware of any proposed legislation  the enactment of  or a change in the interpretation of  certain federal or state laws affecting our ability to price  originate or collect on receivables such as the application of usury laws to our leases and contracts could negatively affect the collection of income on our leases  contracts and loans  as well as the collection of fee income 
any such legislation or change in interpretation  particularly in massachusetts  whose law governs the majority of our leases  contracts and loans  could have a material adverse effect on our ability to originate leases  contracts and loans at current levels of profitability  which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
the sarbanes oxley act of requires companies such as us that are not accelerated filers to comply with more stringent internal control system and monitoring requirements beginning in compliance with this new requirement may place an expensive burden and significant time constraint on these companies with limited resources 

table of contents we may face risks in acquiring other portfolios and companies  including risks relating to how we finance any such acquisition or how we are able to assimilate any portfolios or operations we acquire 
a portion of our growth strategy depends on the consummation of acquisitions of leasing companies or portfolios 
our inability to identify suitable acquisition candidates or portfolios  or to complete acquisitions on favorable terms  could limit our ability to grow our business 
any major acquisition would require a significant portion of our resources 
the timing  size and success  if at all  of our acquisition efforts and any associated capital commitments cannot be readily predicted 
we may finance future acquisitions by using shares of our common stock  cash or a combination of the two 
any acquisition we make using common stock would result in dilution to existing stockholders 
if the common stock does not maintain a sufficient market value  or if potential acquisition candidates are otherwise unwilling to accept common stock as part or all of the consideration for the sale of their businesses  we may be required to utilize more of our cash resources  if available  or to incur additional indebtedness in order to initiate and complete acquisitions 
additional debt  as well as the potential amortization expense related to goodwill and other intangible assets incurred as a result of any such acquisition  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  certain of our credit facilities and subordinated debt agreements contain covenants that do not permit us to merge or consolidate into or with any other person or entity  issue any shares of our capital stock if  after giving effect to such issuance  certain shareholders cease to own or control specified percentages of our voting capital stock  create or acquire any subsidiaries other than certain permitted special purpose subsidiaries  or implement certain changes to our board of directors 
these provisions could prevent us from making an acquisition using shares of our common stock as consideration 
we also may experience difficulties in the assimilation of the operations  services  products and personnel of acquired companies  an inability to sustain or improve the historical revenue levels of acquired companies  the diversion of management s attention from ongoing business operations  and the potential loss of key employees of such acquired companies 
any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if we were to lose key personnel  our operating results may suffer or it may cause a default under our debt facilities 
our success depends to a large extent upon the abilities and continued efforts of richard latour  president and chief executive officer and james r 
jackson  jr  vice president and chief financial officer  and our other senior management 
we have entered into employment agreements with mr 
latour and mr 
jackson  as well as other members of our senior management 
the loss of the services of one or more of the key members of our senior management before we are able to attract and retain qualified replacement personnel could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  under our credit facilities  an event of default would arise if mr 
latour or mr 
jackson were to leave their positions as our chief executive officer or chief financial officer  respectively  unless a suitable replacement were appointed within days 
our failure to comply with these provisions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations
