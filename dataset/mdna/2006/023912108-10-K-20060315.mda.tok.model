charles  sterling  woodstock and the surrounding communities 
the bank conducts business at locations throughout southern wisconsin  including the wisconsin cities of baraboo  madison  monroe  mt 
horeb  portage  waukesha  wauwatosa and the surrounding communities 
through its banking locations  amcore provides various personal banking  commercial banking and related financial services 
amcore also conducts banking business through four supermarket branches  which gives the customer convenient access to banking services seven days a week 
investment portfolio and policies as a complement to its commercial and retail banking segments  the bank also carries a securities investment portfolio 
the level of assets that the company holds in securities is dependent upon a variety of factors 
chief among these factors is the optimal utilization of the company s liquidity and capital 
after consideration of loan demand  excess capital is available to allocate to high quality investment activities that can generate additional income for the company  while still maintaining strong capital ratios 
in addition to producing additional interest spreads for the bank  the investment portfolio is used as a source of liquidity  to manage interest rate risk and to meet pledging requirements of the bank 
the investment portfolio is governed by an investment policy designed to provide maximum flexibility in terms of liquidity and to contain risk from changes in interest rates 
individual holdings are diversified  maximum terms and durations are limited and minimum credit ratings are enforced and monitored 
the bank does not engage in trading activities 
the amount of securities that the company is permitted to invest in that have a higher degree of risk of loss are defined and limited by company policy 
the investment portfolio is managed on a day to day basis by a third party professional investment manager 
portfolio performance and changing risk profiles are regularly monitored by the asset and liability committee and the investment committee of amcore s board of directors 
sources of funding liquidity management is the process by which the company  through its asset and liability committee alco and treasury function  ensures that adequate liquid funds are available to meet its financial commitments on a timely basis  at a reasonable cost and within acceptable risk tolerances 
these commitments include funding credit obligations to borrowers  funding of mortgage originations pending delivery to the secondary market  withdrawals by depositors  repayment of debt when due or called  maintaining adequate collateral for secured deposits and borrowings  payment of dividends by the subsidiaries to the company  payment of operating expenses  funding capital expenditures and maintaining deposit reserve requirements 
liquidity is derived primarily from bank issued deposit growth and retention  principal and interest payments on loans  principal and interest payments  sale  maturity and prepayment of investment securities  net cash provided by operations and access to other funding sources 
other funding sources include brokered certificates of deposit cds  federal funds purchased lines fed funds  federal reserve discount window advances  federal home loan bank fhlb advances  repurchase agreements  commercial paper and back up lines of credit  the sale or securitization of loans  and access to other capital markets 
bank issued deposits from the bank s retail and commercial customers are considered by management to be the primary  most stable and most cost effective source of funding and liquidity 
retail banking segment retail banking services to individuals include deposit demand  savings and time deposit accounts and lending activities 
principal lending types include installment loans primarily direct and indirect automobile lending  mortgage and home equity loans  overdraft protection  personal credit lines and bankcard programs 
mortgage and home equity lending have the lowest risk profile due to the nature of the collateral 
installment loans have an intermediate risk due to the lower principal amounts and the depreciating nature of the collateral 
personal lines and overdraft protection have the highest degree of risk since the loans are unsecured 
the bankcard programs are a fee service for originating the relationship and no credit risk is retained by the bank 
the bank manages its retail lending risk via a centralized credit process  risk scoring  loan to value and other 
table of contents underwriting standards  and knowledge of its customers and their credit history 
as a general rule  the bank does not actively engage in retail lending activities outside its geographic market areas 
for segment financial information  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
commercial banking segment a wide range of financial services are provided to commercial  small business and governmental organizations 
these services include  among others  lending  deposits  letters of credit and cash management services 
the bank has a limited portfolio of equipment leases and does not actively promote this type of financing with its commercial customers 
the commercial banking segment lending products are tailored to the specific customer needs facilities acquisition and expansion  equipment purchases and working capital needs 
commercial lending has a higher risk profile than does retail lending due to the larger dollar amounts involved  the nature of the collateral and a greater variety of economic risks that could potentially affect the loan customer 
the bank manages its commercial lending risks through a centralized underwriting process  serial sign off requirements as dollar amounts increase  lending limits  monitoring concentrations  regular loan review and grading of credits  and an active work out management process for troubled credits 
for segment financial information  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements

amcore has also achieved express lender status  a national designation which significantly shortens the turnaround time from application to loan acceptance 
sba loans are popular with small business customers  offering them another source of financing

residential mortgage loans are originated  of which non conforming adjustable rate  fixed rate  jumbo and balloon mortgages are normally retained in the bank s real estate portfolio

since  when illinois multi bank holding company legislation became effective  there have been many bank mergers and acquisitions in illinois 
these combinations have had the effect of increasing the assets and deposits of bank holding companies involved in such activities 
illinois legislation  effective december   permitted bank acquisitions in illinois by institutions headquartered in any other state which has reciprocal legislation  further increasing competition 
see supervision and regulation later in this item on september   congress passed laws allowing interstate banking and interstate branching 
a year later  nationwide interstate banking became effective allowing institutions to make acquisitions in any state 
beginning july   interstate branching became effective  and banks can merge with affiliate banks or establish de novo branches in any state 
individual states  however  have the right to opt out of interstate branching 
illinois and wisconsin have not opted out  however  iowa has retained the de novo rules for branching 
employment amcore had  full time equivalent employees as of february  amcore provides a variety of benefit plans to its employees including health  dental  group term life and disability insurance  childcare reimbursement  flexible spending accounts  retirement  profit sharing  k  stock option  stock purchase and dividend reinvestment plans 

table of contents supervision and regulation amcore is subject to regulations under the bank holding company act of  as amended the act  and is registered with the federal reserve board frb under the act 
amcore is required by the act to file quarterly and annual reports of its operations and such additional information as the frb may require and is subject  along with its subsidiaries  to examination by the frb 
the acquisition of five percent or more of the voting shares or all or substantially all of the assets of any bank by a bank holding company requires the prior approval of the frb and is subject to certain other federal and state law limitations 
the act also prohibits  with certain exceptions  a bank holding company from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than five percent of the voting shares of any company which is not a bank and from engaging in any business other than banking  managing and controlling banks or furnishing services to banks and their subsidiaries  except that holding companies may engage in  and may own shares of companies engaged in  certain businesses found by the frb to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto 
on august   the frb approved an amendment to add certain activities and to reduce the burden on bank holding companies that desire to conduct these activities by simplifying the regulatory review process 
under current regulations of the frb  a bank holding company and its non bank subsidiaries are permitted  among other activities  to engage in such banking related businesses as sales and consumer finance  equipment leasing  computer service bureau and software operations  mortgage banking  brokerage and financial advisory services 
the act does not place territorial restrictions on the activities of non bank subsidiaries of bank holding companies 
in addition  federal legislation prohibits acquisition of control of a bank or bank holding company without prior notice to certain federal bank regulators 
control is defined in certain cases as acquisition of ten percent or more of the outstanding shares of a bank or bank holding company 
there are a number of obligations and restrictions imposed on bank holding companies and their depository institution subsidiaries by federal law and regulatory policy that are designed to reduce potential loss exposure to the depositors of such depository institutions and to the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic insurance fund in the event the depository institution becomes in danger of default or is in default 
for example  under a policy of the federal reserve with respect to bank holding company operations  a bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary depository institutions and commit resources to support such institutions in circumstances where it might not do so absent such policy 
in addition  the cross guarantee provisions of federal law require insured depository institutions under common control to reimburse the fdic for any loss suffered or reasonably anticipated as a result of the default of a commonly controlled insured depository institution or for any assistance provided by the fdic to a commonly controlled insured depository institution in danger of default 
the federal banking agencies have broad powers under current federal law to take prompt corrective action to resolve problems of insured depository institutions 
the extent of these powers depends upon whether the institutions in question are well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  or critically undercapitalized  as such terms are defined under regulations issued by each of the federal banking agencies 
in late  congress passed the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of that included many provisions that have had significant effects on the cost structure and operational and managerial standards of commercial banks 
in addition to provisions for recapitalization of the bank insurance fund  this act contains provisions that revised bank supervision and regulation  including  among many other things  the monitoring of capital levels  additional management reporting and external audit requirements  and the addition of consumer provisions that include truth in savings disclosures 
the gramm leach bliley act glb act was enacted november  and  among other things  established a comprehensive framework to permit affiliations among commercial banks  insurance companies and securities 
table of contents firms 
to date  the glb act has not materially affected the company s operations 
however  to the extent the glb act permits banks  securities firms and insurance companies to affiliate  the financial services industry may experience further consolidation 
this could result in a growing number of larger financial institutions that offer a wider variety of financial services than the company currently offers and that can aggressively compete in the markets the company currently serves 
the foregoing references to applicable statutes and regulations are brief summaries thereof and are not intended to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of such statutes and regulations 
amcore is supervised and examined by the frb 
the bank and aigna are supervised and regularly examined by the office of the comptroller of the currency occ and are subject to examination by the frb 
in addition  the bank is subject to periodic examination by the fdic 
finance is regulated by the illinois department of financial institutions 
ais is supervised and examined by the nasd and the sec 
subsidiary dividends and capital legal limitations exist as to the extent to which the bank can lend or pay dividends to amcore and or its affiliates 
the payment of dividends by a national bank without prior regulatory approval is limited to the current year s net income plus the adjusted retained net income for the two preceding years 
the payment of dividends by any bank or bank holding company is affected by the requirement to maintain adequate capital pursuant to the capital adequacy guidelines issued by the frb and regulations issued by the fdic and the occ collectively agencies 
as of december   approximately million was available for payment to amcore in the form of dividends without prior regulatory approval  of which million could be paid without causing the bank to be less than well capitalized 
the bank is also limited as to the amount it may lend to amcore and its affiliates 
at december   the maximum amount available to amcore and its affiliates in the form of loans approximated million 
there were no loans outstanding from the bank to affiliates at december  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the frb issues risk based capital guidelines for bank holding companies 
these capital rules require minimum capital levels as a percent of risk weighted assets 
in order to be adequately capitalized under these guidelines  banking organizations must have minimum capital ratios of and for tier capital and total capital  respectively 
the frb also established leverage capital requirements intended primarily to establish minimum capital requirements for those banking organizations that have historically invested a significant portion of their funds in low risk assets 
federally supervised banks are required to maintain a minimum leverage ratio of not less than 
refer to the liquidity and capital management section of item for a summary of amcore s capital ratios as of december  and see also note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
governmental monetary policies and economic conditions the earnings of all subsidiaries are affected not only by general economic conditions  but also by the policies of various regulatory authorities 
in particular  the frb influences general economic conditions and interest rates through various monetary policies and tools 
it does so primarily through open market operations in us government securities  varying the discount rate on member and non member bank borrowings  and setting reserve requirements against bank deposits 
frb monetary policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of banks in the past and are expected to do so in the future 
the general effect of such policies upon the future business and earnings of each of the subsidiary companies cannot accurately be predicted 
interest rate sensitivity has a major impact on the earnings of banks 
as market rates change  yields earned on assets may not necessarily move to the same degree as rates paid on liabilities 
for this reason  amcore attempts to minimize earnings volatility related to fluctuations in interest rates through the use of a formal asset

director of the bank and aigna since november item a risk factors the company faces a variety of risks that are inherent in its business  including interest rate  credit  liquidity  price market  transaction operation  compliance legal  strategic and reputation 
following is a discussion of these risk factors 
while the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be harmed by any of the following risks or other factors discussed elsewhere in this report  management s discussion and analysis and notes to the consolidated financial statements  the mere existence of risk is not necessarily reason for 
table of contents concern 
however  the following risks could cause actual results to materially differ from those discussed in any forward looking statement 
interest rate risk as part of its normal operations  the company  like most financial institutions  is subject to interest rate risk on the interest earnings assets it invests in primarily loans and securities and the interest bearing liabilities it funds with primarily customer deposits  brokered deposits and borrowed funds 
this includes the risk that interest earning assets may be more responsive to changes in interest rates than interest bearing liabilities  or vice versa repricing risk  the risk that the individual interest rates or rate indices underlying various interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities may not change to the same degree over a given time period basis risk  and the risk of changing interest rate relationships across the spectrum of interest earning asset and interest bearing liability maturities yield curve risk 
interest rates are sensitive to many factors that are beyond the company s control  including general economic conditions  the policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and competition 
these factors may cause fluctuations in interest rates that adversely affect the fair market values of the company s financial instruments  cash flows  and net income 
credit risk the company is exposed to the risk that third parties that owe it money  securities  or other assets will not perform their obligations 
credit risk arises anytime the company extends  commits  invests  or otherwise exposes company funds through contractual agreements  whether reflected on or off the balance sheet 
these parties may default on their obligations due to bankruptcy  lack of liquidity  operational failure or other reasons 
credit risk includes the risk that the company s rights against third parties including guarantors may not be enforceable or realizable in all circumstances 
the company s credit risk is concentrated in its loan portfolio including commitments and its investment portfolio 
the company also has credit risk through other financial instruments including derivative contracts and company owned life insurance 
credit risk is affected by a variety of factors including the credit worthiness of the borrower or other party  the sufficiency of underlying collateral  the enforceability of third party guarantees  changing economic and industry conditions and concentrations of credit by loan type  terms or geographic area  changes in the financial condition of the borrower or other party  and by credit and underwriting policies 
liquidity risk liquidity risk is the potential that the company will be unable to meet its obligations as they come due  capitalize on growth opportunities as they arise  or pay regular dividends because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding in a timely basis  at a reasonable cost and within acceptable risk tolerances 
liquidity is required to fund credit obligations to borrowers  mortgage originations pending delivery to the secondary market  withdrawals by depositors  repayment of debt when due or called  dividends to shareholders  operating expenses and capital expenditures  among other things 
liquidity is derived primarily from bank issued deposit growth and retention  principal and interest payments on loans  principal and interest payments  sale  maturity and prepayment of investment securities  net cash provided from operations and access to other funding sources 
the company s liquidity can be affected by a variety of factors  including general economic conditions  market disruption  operational problems affecting third parties or the company  unfavorable pricing  competition  the company s credit rating and regulatory restrictions 

table of contents price market risk price market risk is the risk to earnings or capital arising from adverse changes in the value of financial instruments 
while this includes credit and liquidity risk  the company considers interest rate risk to be its most significant market risk 
there is an inverse relationship to changes in the fair value of the fixed rate financial instruments with changes in interest rates  meaning that when rates increase the value of the financial instrument will decrease 
conversely  when rates decline the value of the financial instrument will increase 
while this relationship applies to all fixed rate financial instruments  the primary instruments affected by price market risk are traded instruments 
although the company currently has only an available for sale and not a traded investment securities portfolio and  therefore  market fluctuations are recorded through equity and not the statements of income  on going adverse market values could cause some security market values to deteriorate to the extent that they are considered to be other than temporary 
at that time  the company would be required to write down security values to their market value as a charge to earnings 
transaction operation risk transaction operation risk is a function of internal controls  information systems  employee integrity and operating processes 
significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal processes  controls  staff or systems could lead to impairment of liquidity  financial loss  disruption of the business  liability to clients  regulatory intervention or damage to the company s reputation 
for example  the company is highly dependent on its ability to process  on a daily basis  a large number of transactions 
failure of financial  accounting  data processing or other operating systems and controls to operate properly  of becoming disabled  or to keep pace with increasing volumes  could adversely affect the company s ability to capture  process and accurately report these transactions 
compliance legal risk the company is subject to compliance with an expanding body of regulatory  supervisory and examination requirements including capital adequacy  safety soundness  customer privacy  anti money laundering  truth in savings lending and financial reporting  to name a few 
failure or the inability to comply with these various requirements can lead to diminished reputation and investor confidence  reduced franchise value  loss of business  curtailment of expansion opportunities  fines and penalties  intervention or sanctions by regulators and costly litigation or expensive additional controls and systems 
strategic risk strategic risk is the potential for adverse consequences to the company of poor business decisions or improper implementation of those decisions 
it includes identifying and defining goals for the continued growth and success of the company  developing strategies to accomplish the goals  and acquiring  developing and retaining the physical resources and human capital necessary to successfully execute the strategies 
presently  the company has four primary strategic initiatives branch expansion  quality loan growth  deposit growth and increasing fee revenues 
the company s ability to successfully execute these initiatives depends upon a variety of factors  including our ability to attract and retain experienced personnel  the continued availability of desirable business opportunities and locations  the competitive responses from other financial institutions in our new market areas  and the ability to manage growth 
all of these strategies could cause the company s expenses to increase faster than revenues 
there are considerable initial and on going costs involved in opening branches  growing loans in emerging markets  attracting new deposit relationships and repositioning the investment management and trust segment that can negatively impact earnings 
for example  it takes time for new branches and relationships to achieve profitability 

table of contents expenses could be further increased if there are delays in the opening of new branches or if attraction strategies are more costly than expected 
delays in opening new branches can be caused by a number of factors such as the inability to find suitable locations  zoning and construction delays  and success in attracting qualified personnel to staff the new branch 
in addition  there is no assurance that a new branch will be successful even after it has been established 
reputation risk reputation risk arises from the possibility that negative publicity regarding the company s business practices  whether true or not  will cause a decline in its customer base or result in costly litigation 
in a service industry  such as the financial services industry  where product choices between companies are not always clearly distinguishable and which in many cases are fungible  a company s reputation for honesty  fair dealing and good corporate governance may be one of its most important assets 
loss of or damage to that reputation can have severe consequences 
item b unresolved staff comments none 
item properties on december   amcore had locations  of which were owned and were leased 
the commercial  retail and mortgage banking segments had locations  of which were owned and were leased 
the investment management and trust segment had one leased facility 
all of these offices are considered by management to be well maintained and adequate for the purpose intended 
see item and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item of this document for further information on properties 
in addition  amcore had atm machine locations that were available without fee to amcore customers 
item legal proceedings management believes that no litigation is threatened or pending in which the company faces potential loss or exposure which will materially affect the company s consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations 
since the company s subsidiaries act as depositories of funds  trustee and escrow agents  they occasionally are named as defendants in lawsuits involving claims to the ownership of funds in particular accounts 
this and other litigation is incidental to the company s business

table of contents the company s policy is to declare regular quarterly dividends based upon the company s earnings  financial position  capital requirements and such other factors deemed relevant by the board of directors 
this dividend policy is subject to change  however  and the payment of dividends by the company is necessarily dependent upon the availability of earnings and the company s expected financial condition in the future 
the payment of dividends on the common stock is also subject to regulatory capital requirements 
for further information on quarterly dividend payments  see the condensed quarterly earnings and stock price summary at the end of item the company s principal source of funds for dividend payments to its stockholders is dividends received from the bank 
under applicable banking laws  the declaration of dividends by the bank in any year  in excess of its net profits  as defined  for that year  combined with its retained net profits of the preceding two years  must be approved by the office of the comptroller of the currency

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion highlights the significant factors affecting amcore financial  inc and subsidiaries amcore or the company consolidated financial condition as of december  compared to december   and the consolidated results of operations for the three years ended december  the discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements  and selected financial data appearing elsewhere within this report 
factors influencing forward looking statements this report on form k contains  and periodic filings with the securities and exchange commission and written or oral statements made by the company s officers and directors to the press  potential investors  securities analysts and others will contain  forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities act of  and the company intends that such forward looking statements be subject to the safe harbors created thereby with respect to  among other things  the financial condition  results of operations  plans  objectives  future performance and business of amcore 
statements that are not historical facts  including statements about beliefs and expectations  are forward looking statements 
these statements are based upon beliefs and assumptions of amcore s management and on information currently available to such management 
the use of the words believe  expect  anticipate  plan  estimate  should  may  will or similar expressions identify forward looking statements 
forward looking statements speak only as of the date they are made  and amcore undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements in light of new information or future events 
contemplated  projected  forecasted or estimated results in such forward looking statements involve certain inherent risks and uncertainties 
a number of factors many of which are beyond the ability of the company to control or predict could cause actual results to differ materially from those in its forward looking statements 
these factors include  among others  the following possibilities i heightened competition  including specifically the intensification of price competition  the entry of new competitors and the formation of new products by new or existing competitors  ii adverse state  local and federal legislation and regulation  iii failure to obtain new customers and retain existing customers  iv inability to carry out marketing and or expansion plans  v ability to attract and retain key executives or personnel  vi changes in interest rates including the effect of prepayments  vii general economic and business conditions which are less favorable than expected  viii equity and fixed income market fluctuations  ix unanticipated changes in industry trends  x unanticipated changes in credit quality and risk factors  xi success in gaining regulatory approvals when required  xii changes in federal reserve board monetary policies  xiii unexpected outcomes on existing or new litigation in which amcore  its subsidiaries  officers  directors or employees are named defendants  xiv technological changes  xv changes in us generally accepted accounting principles  xvi changes in assumptions or conditions affecting the application of critical accounting estimates  xvii inability of third party vendors to perform critical services for the company or its customers  xviii disruption of operations caused by the conversion and installation of data processing systems  and xix zoning restrictions or other limitations at the local level  which could prevent limited branches from transitioning to full service facilities 
critical accounting estimates the financial condition and results of operations for amcore presented in the consolidated financial statements  accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements  selected financial data appearing elsewhere within this report  and management s discussion and analysis are  to a large degree  dependent upon the company s accounting policies 
the selection and application of these accounting policies involve judgments  estimates and uncertainties that are susceptible to change 

table of contents presented below are discussions of those accounting policies that management believes require its most difficult  subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain critical accounting estimates and are most important to the portrayal and understanding of the company s financial condition and results of operations 
in the event that different assumptions or conditions were to prevail  and depending upon the severity of such changes  the possibility of materially different financial condition or results of operations is a reasonable likelihood

allowance for loan losses loans  the company s largest income earning asset category  are periodically evaluated by management in order to establish an estimated allowance for loan losses allowance that are probable as of the respective reporting date and considered adequate to absorb probable losses 
this evaluation includes specific loss estimates on certain individually reviewed loans where it is probable that the company will be unable to collect all of the amounts due principal or interest according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement impaired loans and statistical loss estimates for loan groups or pools that are based on historical loss experience  as adjusted for other loss estimates that are based upon the size  quality  and concentration characteristics of the various loan portfolios  adverse situations that may affect a borrower s ability to repay  and current economic and industry conditions  among other things 
additions to the allowance are charged against earnings for the period as a provision for loan losses provision 
conversely  this evaluation could result in a decrease in the allowance and provision 
actual loan losses are charged against and reduce the allowance when management believes that the collection of principal will not occur 
unpaid interest attributable to prior years for loans that are placed on non accrual status is also charged against and reduces the allowance 
unpaid interest for the current year for loans that are placed on non accrual status is charged against and reduces the interest income previously recognized 
subsequent recoveries of amounts previously charged to the allowance  if any  are credited to and increase the allowance 
the allowance is also subject to periodic examination by regulators whose review includes a determination as to its adequacy to absorb probable losses 
those judgments and assumptions that are most critical to the application of this accounting policy are the initial and on going credit worthiness of the borrower  the amount and timing of future cash flows of the borrower that are available for repayment of the loan  the sufficiency of underlying collateral  the enforceability of third party guarantees  the frequency and subjectivity of loan reviews and risk gradings  emerging or changing trends that might not be fully captured in the historical loss experience  and charges against the allowance for actual losses that are greater or less than previously estimated 
these judgments and assumptions are dependent upon or can be influenced by a variety of factors including the breadth and depth of experience of lending officers  credit administration and the corporate loan review staff that periodically review the status of the loan  changing economic and industry conditions  changes in the financial condition of the borrower and changes in the value and availability of the underlying collateral and guarantees 
while the company strives to reflect all known risk factors in its evaluations  judgment errors may occur 
if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail  the amount and timing of interest income and loan losses could be materially different 
these factors are most pronounced during economic downturns and may continue into an economic recovery  as specific credit performance may not be immediately affected by the stress of the downturn 
since  as described above  so many factors can affect the amount and timing of losses on loans  it is difficult to predict with any degree of certainty the effect to income if different conditions or assumptions were to prevail 
nonetheless  if any combination of the above judgments or assumptions were to have adversely affected the adequacy of the allowance by ten percent during  an additional provision of million may have been necessary

table of contents mortgage servicing rights the company recognizes as separate assets the right to service mortgage loans for others 
because it is retained as an asset  the amount allocated to mortgage servicing rights will have a favorable impact on the amount of gain or loss that is recognized on the sale of the loans 
the mortgage servicing rights asset is amortized in proportion to the principal amortization of the underlying loan portfolios that are being serviced 
amortization of the servicing rights asset will reduce the amount of income that is recorded in the respective period from the servicing of the mortgage loans 
each reporting period  the company re evaluates the fair value of its remaining mortgage servicing rights asset 
the amount by which the unamortized carrying amount of mortgage servicing rights exceeds the new estimate of fair value is charged against earnings for the period 
rather than directly reducing the unamortized carrying amount of the servicing rights asset  a valuation allowance is established for the same amount as the charge against earnings 
in subsequent reporting periods  depending upon current estimates of fair value  the valuation allowance may be reversed 
the reversal is limited to the remaining amount of the valuation allowance and will result in an increase in earnings 
the periodic re evaluation of fair value is based upon current estimates of the present value of remaining net servicing cash flows that incorporate numerous assumptions including the cost of servicing the loans  discount rates  prepayment rates and default rates 
this re evaluation is performed by stratifying mortgage servicing rights assets into pools based upon loan type and investor 
valuation allowances are recorded for each defined pool  as applicable 
valuation allowances required for one pool cannot be offset by the amount that the fair value of another pool exceeds its unamortized carrying amount 
judgments and assumptions that are most critical to the application of this accounting policy are prepayment speeds that will determine the amount and period of servicing revenue that is expected to be earned  appropriate risk weighted discount rates used to determine the present value of estimated net future cash flows  estimated interest earned on amounts collected for real estate tax and property insurance premiums that are held in escrow until payment is due and estimated costs to service the loans 
these assumptions are based upon actual performance of the underlying loans and the general market consensus regarding changes in mortgage and other interest rates 
for example  declining mortgage interest rates typically result in accelerated mortgage prepayments  which tend to shorten the life and reduce the value of the servicing rights asset 
if different assumptions and conditions were to prevail  materially different amortization and valuation allowances than those that were recorded may be required 
since  as described above  so many factors can affect the value of mortgage servicing rights  it is difficult to predict with any degree of certainty the effect to income if different conditions or assumptions were to prevail 
nonetheless  if any combination of the above judgments or assumptions were to have adversely affected their fair value by ten percent beyond their carrying value at december   an impairment charge of million would have been necessary

loan securitizations and sale of receivables the company periodically sells certain indirect automobile loans in securitization transactions 
upon the sale  the net carrying amount of the loans are removed from the consolidated balance sheet in exchange for cash and certain retained residual interests 
the retained interests include rights to service the loans that are sold the servicing rights and an interest in residual cash flows the interest only strip 
the interest only strip includes the excess of interest collected on the loans over the amount required to be paid to the investors and the securitization agent the excess spread plus an interest in sales proceeds that are not remitted by the securitization trust at the time of the initial sale of the loans to the extent it exceeds projected credit losses the credit enhancement or overcollateralization 
the carrying value of the loans removed from the balance 
table of contents sheet includes the unpaid principal balance of the loans  net of an allocable portion of the allowance for loan losses  minus the portion of the carrying value of the loans that are allocated to the retained residual interests 
because they are retained assets  the amount allocated and recorded for the residual interests has a favorable impact on the amount of gain or loss that is recognized upon the sale of the loans 
since the projected income from the servicing rights has approximated what is considered adequate compensation for servicing the loans  no asset or liability is recorded for servicing rights 
income from servicing is recognized as earned pursuant to the terms of the servicing agreement and to the extent cash collections from the borrowers exceed payments to the investors and agent 
cash collections in excess of the servicing rights income that is earned is next applied to the interest only strip 
the value allocated to the interest only strip is reduced and interest income is recorded assuming a constant yield based upon the discount rate used to estimate its fair value 
at the end of the estimated life of the securitization  the carrying value of the interest only strip that is attributable to the excess spread will be fully amortized 
at that time  the carrying value of the interest only strip that is attributable to the overcollateralization will have accreted to the cash that is expected to be released by the securitization trust 
because the company s retained residual interests are subordinated to the interests of securitization investors and the trust agent  there are risks that the carrying value of the interest only strip will not be fully recovered  which would result in a charge to earnings 
these include the risk that the asset will have a shorter life than originally estimated prepayment risk  that actual credit losses may exceed expected credit losses credit risk and that interest paid to the securitization trust and investors will be greater than projected interest rate risk 
the company s risk of loss attributable to credit and prepayment is limited to its interest in the interest only strip 
neither the investors nor the securitization trust have any further recourse to the company s other assets 
interest rate risk could exceed the company s interest in the excess spread  but such a possibility is not considered probable as of december  each reporting period  the fair value of the interest only strip is evaluated based upon current estimates and assumptions of the net present value of residual future cash flows net of remaining expected credit losses and anticipated releases of overcollateralization 
changes in fair value are generally recorded net of tax as a component of other comprehensive income oci 
if this evaluation results in fair values that are less than the amortized carrying value of the interest only strip  and if the decline is considered other than temporary  in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased and retained interests in securitized financial assets  the decline is charged against earnings for the current period 
finally  each reporting period  new interest only strip amortization schedules are developed based upon current estimates  assumptions  adjusted carrying values and revised constant yields 
judgments and assumptions that are most critical to the application of this accounting policy are estimated defaults  delinquencies and credit losses  projected prepayment speeds  projected interest rates  and discount rates 
these assumptions are based upon demonstrated credit performance  the prepayment history of the underlying loans and market consensus on future interest rates 
these are  in turn  most highly influenced by general economic conditions  with the greatest adverse effect during economic downturns and periods of rapidly changing interest rates 
if different assumptions and conditions were to prevail  noticeably different results could occur because the recorded value of the interest only strip may need to be written off or written down faster than planned and cash flows from the retained residual interests may be less than expected 
since  as described above  so many factors can affect the value of the interest only strip  it is difficult to predict with any degree of certainty the affect on income if different conditions or assumptions were to prevail 
nonetheless  if any combination of the above judgments or assumptions were to have adversely affected their value by an additional ten percent and the decline was determined to be other than temporary  an impairment charge of  would have been necessary 
this amount includes a  temporary impairment valuation allowance charged to oci as of december  see also note of the notes to consolidated financial statements

key initiatives and other significant events key initiatives branch expansion during  the company s banking operations bank launched a branch expansion initiative targeting the area generally bounded by interstates in the north  and in the east  in the south and and in the west the branch expansion 
the branch expansion strategy initially targets markets where there are high concentrations of mid size businesses  with a seasoned commercial lending and treasury management sales staff in a leased facility limited branch office or lbo 
once a book of business is developed and the lbo becomes profitable  plans to develop a permanent site for a full service facility in a 
table of contents nearby area that is surrounded by a high concentration of homeowners with strong population and household income growth are initiated 
increased capabilities in the markets served by these facilities  in addition to better brand recognition  are expected to accelerate the company s ability to generate bank issued deposits  which will better support loan growth and decrease the use of wholesale funding 
since the inception of the branch expansion strategy in april  new branches  net of closed offices  have opened 
the new locations have contributed billion in loans and million in deposits outstanding as of december  same store contributions  which include new branches that have been open at least one year  were billion in loans and million in deposits outstanding at december  during  the company opened three limited branch offices in libertyville and orland park  illinois and wauwatosa  wisconsin  a milwaukee suburb 
during  the company anticipates opening four full service branches and up to seven lbos 
by the end of the company expects to have two thirds of its branches located in markets that the company believes exhibit strong growth characteristics 
to date  the company s board of directors has authorized a capital investment of million to fund the company s branch expansion 
as of december   million of the total million capital commitment remained to be spent 
as a complement to its branch expansion  the bank has also expanded its automated teller machine system atms  which includes both owned and third party operated  to in illinois and in wisconsin  or overall at december  from in illinois and in wisconsin  or overall  at december  these amounts include additional atms located in walgreens drug stores throughout wisconsin as part of a co branding relationship 
the placement of additional atms is an important part of amcore s commitment to provide quality customer service as additional atms provide amcore customers greater ease and convenience in completing banking transactions 
quality loan growth improving credit quality is part of amcore s quality loan growth initiative 
as part of this initiative  the company s commercial workout group intervenes at an early stage when an account begins to show signs of stress 
taking early action helps the company to limit any further erosion in recoverable value 
average loans rose million to billion during  an increase over over the same period of time  total non accrual loans decreased or million to million 
loans ninety days past due and still accruing increased or million to million 
the increase was primarily comprised of three accounts that are well secured and in the process of collection with no significant losses expected 
deposit growth average bank issued deposits grew to billion in  an increase of  or million  compared to billion in amcore continues to focus on transactional deposit growth  such as checking accounts  which helps lower funding costs  as well as increasing the number of households served by the company 
handling a customer s checking account enables the bank to cross sell other products and increases the likelihood of retaining their business over time 
the company s goal is to become the customer s primary bank  meeting all of their banking  mortgage and investment needs 
over the last year  the total number of households served by amcore increased by 
on the commercial side  the company s main emphasis is on cash management products  including remote deposit capture  as it focuses on its core niche of mid size commercial customers 
amcore continues to focus on bank issued deposit growth because it provides a source of funding for the branch expansion and the quality loan growth initiatives  and is also a means of reducing its reliance on wholesale funding sources 
increasing investment management and trust income as of the end of  the company completed its migration to an open architecture sales platform  which allows greater customer access to non proprietary products 
this included the transition of million in assets of three company managed vintage equity funds into two mutual funds managed by federated investors  inc federated in september and the sale of the 
table of contents company s asset management subsidiary img to west bancorporation  inc west banc on december  the federated transaction resulted in an after tax gain of  while the sale of img resulted in a million after tax loss 
both amounts are reported in discontinued operations 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the amount of the west banc loss is primarily due to a million tax charge that resulted from a tax basis that was significantly lower than the company s carrying value 
with these transactions  amcore has transitioned from being a developer of proprietary investment products to being a provider that can offer its customers a wider array of investment product choices 
the results of img for the current and prior periods are reported as discontinued operations 
investment management and trust income from continuing operations declined  or  to million in from million in assets under administration totaled billion at the end of compared to billion at the end of this decline includes the combined impact of the federated and west banc transactions

in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position fsp nos 
fas and fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  which will apply to reporting periods beginning after december  the fsps provide guidance on determining when investments in certain debt and equity securities are considered impaired  whether that impairment is other than temporary  and on measuring such impairment loss 
the fsps also include accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of other than temporary impairment and requirements for certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other than temporary impairments 
based upon the status of the company s investment portfolio and management s intent as of december   the adoption of this fsp is not expected to have a material impact

these procedures are subject to review by the occ to determine if they comply with the commitment made in the agreement or whether additional steps are necessary 
the agreement with the occ is not expected to limit the bank s ability to continue the branch expansion 

table of contents earnings review of consolidated statements of income the following highlights a comparative discussion of the major components of net income and their impact for the last three years 
net interest income net interest income is the difference between income earned on interest earning assets and the interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities 
the interest income on certain loans and investment securities is not subject to federal income tax 
for analytical purposes  the interest income and rates on these types of assets are adjusted to a fully taxable equivalent  or fte basis 
the fte adjustment was calculated using amcore s statutory federal income tax rate of 
overview fte adjusted interest income is as follows in thousands years ended december  interest income book basis fte adjustment interest income fte basis interest expense net interest income fte basis net interest income on an fte basis increased million or in and increased million or in the increases for both and were primarily driven by increases in average loan volumes of and  respectively 
net interest spread is the difference between the average rates on interest earning assets and the average rates on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin represents net interest income divided by average earning assets 
these ratios can also be used to analyze net interest income 
since a portion of the company s funding is derived from interest free sources  primarily demand deposits  other liabilities and stockholders equity  the effective rate paid for all funding sources is lower than the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities alone 
as table indicates  the net interest spread declined basis points to in from in  and increased basis points in from the level of 
the net interest margin was in  a decline of six basis points from in the level was an increase of five basis points from in the level of net interest income is the result of the relationship between the total volume and mix of interest earning assets and the rates earned and the total volume and mix of interest bearing liabilities and the rates paid 
the rate and volume components associated with interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities can be segregated to analyze the period to period changes in net interest income 
changes due to rate volume variances have been allocated between changes due to average volume and changes due to average rate based on the absolute value of each to the total change of both categories 
because of changes in the mix of the components of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the computations for each of the components do not equal the calculation for interest earning assets as a total  or interest bearing liabilities as a total 
table analyzes the changes attributable to the volume and rate components of net interest income 
changes due to volume in  net interest income fte increased due to average volume by million when compared to this increase was comprised of a million increase in interest income that was 
table of contents partially offset by a million increase in interest expense 
in  net interest income fte increased due to average volume by million 
this was comprised of a million increase in interest income that was partially offset by a million increase in interest expense 
the increase in interest income of million was primarily due to a million or increase in average loans 
average commercial real estate and commercial loans increased a combined million  driven mostly by the branch expansion 
average residential real estate loans increased million 
average consumer loan balances declined million compared to the prior year  largely due to the auto loan sales and lower volumes of indirect automobile lending 
the increase in average loans was funded by a million or increase in average bank issued deposits 
average wholesale funding declined by million 
the increase in average bank issued deposits was attributable to the company s deposit growth and branch expansion initiatives 
the increase in interest income of million was driven by a million or increase in average loans and a million or increase in average investment securities 
the growth in average loans came from an increase of million in commercial lending driven mostly by the branch expansion 
average consumer loan balances declined million compared to the prior year  largely due to the auto loan sales  and residential real estate loans declined million 
the growth in average investment securities was primarily attributable to mortgage backed securities as the company sought to replace mortgage related assets that prepaid during the mortgage re financing boom in and and pre funding of expected cash flows from mortgage backed securities 
the increase in average loans and investment securities was funded by a million or increase in average bank issued deposits and a million or increase in average wholesale fundings  which included a million increase in wholesale deposits 
the increase in average bank issued deposits was attributable to the company s deposit growth and branch expansion initiatives 
changes due to rate during  net interest income fte declined due to average rates by million when compared with this was comprised of a million increase in interest income that was more than offset by a million increase in interest expense 
both loan yields and funding costs were affected by eight basis point increases in the federal funds fed funds rate that occurred throughout the yield on average earning assets increased basis points to during  compared to in this was primarily attributable to an basis point increase in average loan yields due to increasing loan volumes in the rising rate environment 
during this same period of time  the rate paid on average interest bearing liabilities increased basis points 
all categories of liabilities experienced increased rates driven by increases in short term rates 
interest bearing demand and savings accounts  which saw the largest increase  were also affected by promotional deposit pricing strategies that were part of the deposit growth initiative 
during  net interest income fte increased due to average rates by million when compared with this was comprised of a million decrease in interest income that was more than offset by a million decline in interest expense 
the yield on average earning assets declined basis points 
this was comprised of a basis point decline in the yield on average loans and a basis point decline in the yield on average investment securities 
four basis point increases in the fed funds rate  that occurred during the second half of  were insufficient in terms of magnitude and length of time in effect to offset the negative impact on re financing and re pricing of loans and investment securities of a basis point decline in the national prime rate that occurred from january through june the rate paid on average interest bearing liabilities declined basis points during  compared to this was primarily due to decreased rates paid on certificates of deposit cds  including brokered cds  as older cds bearing higher rates matured and re priced during the period of lower interest rates and were not yet fully impacted by the increases in short term rates during the latter half of 
table of contents like most financial institutions  amcore has an exposure to changes in both short term and long term interest rates 
the company expects its net interest margin to experience some modest compression in the near term 
among those factors that could cause margin and spread not to perform as anticipated by the company include greater and more frequent than anticipated changes in interest rates  including the impact of basis risk between various interest rate indices  changes in the shape of the yield curve  the effect of prepayments or renegotiated rates  increased price competition on both deposits and loans  promotional pricing on deposits  changes in the mix of earning assets and the mix of liabilities  including greater than anticipated use of wholesale sources to fund the branch expansion  and greater than expected loan delinquencies resulting in non accrual status 
over a one year horizon  amcore expects that its interest rate risk will be greater should interest rates increase 
provision for loan losses the provision see critical accounting estimates discussion was million  a decrease of  or from million in reductions in specific loss estimates on individual loans were largely offset by higher loss estimates on delinquent loans and by changes in loss estimates on loan concentrations 
net charge offs were million or basis points of average loans in  compared to million or basis points of average loans in the provision was million  a decrease of million or from million in reduced loan concentration concerns  lower net charge offs  improved economic conditions  lower delinquencies and non accrual loans and improved credit quality due to increasing experience in branch expansion markets and expanded workout collection activities were all factors contributing to the reduction in the provision 
net charge offs were million or basis points of average loans in  compared to million or basis points of average loans in non interest income total non interest income is comprised primarily of fee based revenues from investment management and trust  bank related service charges on deposits and mortgage banking income 
net security gains or losses  gain on auto loan sales and branch sales  increases in cash surrender value csv and death benefits on bank and company owned life insurance coli  brokerage commission income and bankcard fee income are also included in this category 
overview for  non interest income totaled million  an increase of  or from million in increases in service charges on deposits and other non interest income were partly offset by lower net security gains  gains on sale of loans and mortgage banking income 
for  non interest income totaled million  a decline of million or from million in the decline was primarily attributable to reductions in mortgage banking income and branch gains that occurred in investment management and trust income investment management and trust income includes trust services  estate administration  financial planning  and employee benefit plan administration and recordkeeping services 
investment management and trust income has historically been the company s largest source of non interest income and totaled million in this was a decrease of  or from million in this followed a decrease of  or less than from million in the decline for was primarily attributable to lower personal trust services and mutual fund services income 
the decline in was primarily due to lower mutual fund services and estate administration income that was nearly offset by increased personal trust services income and retirement benefit plan services income 
investment management and trust income does not include million  million and million of asset management related fees for  and  respectively 
these have been reclassified to discontinued operations as a result of the federated transaction and the sale of img to west banc see increasing investment management and trust income 
table of contents discussion 
in  the company expects revenues from other sources of approximately  to partially offset the loss in asset management related fees  for a net revenue reduction of million as a result of the federated and west banc transactions 
at december   total assets under administration totaled billion compared to billion at the end of this decline reflects the combined impact of the federated and west banc transactions 
service charges on deposits service charges on deposits  currently the company s largest source of non interest income  totaled million in  a million or increase over million in this follows an increase of million or from million in service charges on personal deposit accounts were the primary driver of the increases for both periods and were impacted by an increase in deposit accounts resulting from the deposit growth initiative 
mortgage banking income mortgage banking income includes fees generated from the underwriting  originating and servicing of mortgage loans along with gains realized from the sale of these loans  net of origination costs  servicing rights amortization and impairment 
for  mortgage banking income was million  a decline of million from million in total closings were million in compared to million in new purchase mortgage closings were million or of total closings in  compared to million or of total closings in the decline in mortgage banking income was primarily due to lower gains on the sales of mortgage loans into the secondary market during a period of rising interest rates 
gains totaled million in compared to million in for  mortgage banking income was million  a decline of million from million in the decline included a  mortgage servicing rights impairment charge in  compared to a million impairment reversal in excluding impairment charges and reversals  mortgage banking income declined million driven by a decline in closings to million in  from million in that was due to decreased refinancing activity 
new purchase mortgage closings were million or of total closings in  compared to million or of total closings in the company expects continued growth in new purchase mortgages as a result of additional mortgage originators  primarily in the branch expansion markets 
new purchase mortgage growth could be negatively affected by a number of factors beyond the company s control  including heightened competition  higher mortgage interest rates  declines in new housing construction and adverse regulatory developments 
as of december   the carrying value of amcore s capitalized mortgage servicing rights was million  with no impairment valuation allowance 
this compares to million at december   net of a  impairment valuation allowance 
the unpaid principal balance of mortgage loans serviced for others was billion as of december  this compares to billion as of december  the net carrying value of the company s capitalized mortgage servicing rights  as a percentage of the unpaid principal balance of mortgage loans serviced for others  was as of december  and coli income coli income totaled million in  a  or decline from million in this compares with a million or decrease in from million in the decline was due to  in death benefit payouts received in that were partly offset by a  downward adjustment recorded in due to a change in the carrier s estimate of one policy s csv

earnings review by business segment amcore s internal reporting and planning process focuses on four primary lines of business segment s commercial banking  retail banking  investment management and trust  and mortgage banking 
note of the notes to consolidated financial statements presents a condensed income statement and total assets for each segment 
the financial information presented was derived from the company s internal profitability reporting system that is used by management to monitor and manage the financial performance of the company 
this information is based on internal management accounting policies which have been developed to reflect the underlying economics of the segments and  to the extent practicable  to portray each segment as if it operated on a stand 
table of contents alone basis 
thus  each segment  in addition to its direct revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities  includes an allocation of shared support function expenses 
the commercial  retail and mortgage banking segments also include funds transfer adjustments to appropriately reflect the cost of funds on loans made and funding credits on deposits generated 
apart from these adjustments  the accounting policies used are similar to those described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
since there are no comprehensive authorities for management accounting equivalent to us generally accepted accounting principles  the information presented is not necessarily comparable with similar information from other financial institutions 
in addition  methodologies used to measure  assign and allocate certain items may change from time to time to reflect  among other things  accounting estimate refinements  changes in risk profiles  changes in customers or product lines  and changes in management structure 
as a result of the federated and west banc transactions  the results of img for the current and prior periods are reported as discontinued operations 
total segment results differ from consolidated results primarily due to inter segment eliminations  certain corporate administration costs  items not otherwise allocated in the management accounting process and treasury and investment activities 
the impact of these items is aggregated to reconcile the amounts presented for the segments to the consolidated results and is included in the other column of note of the notes to consolidated financial statements

the increase in interest expense  as adjusted for net cost of fund allocations  was primarily due to the increased funding needs associated with the loan growth combined with rising interest rates 
the decline in provision was due to reductions in specific loss estimates on individually reviewed loans and lower inter segment allocations that were partially offset by higher loss estimates on delinquencies  changes in loss estimates on loan concentrations and increased net charge offs

the billion of total securities available for sale includes gross unrealized gains of million and gross unrealized losses of million 
unrealized gains and unrealized losses is the difference between a security s fair value and carrying value 
the fair value of a security is generally impacted by two factors  market risk and credit risk 
market risk is the exposure of the security to changes in interest rate 
there is an inverse relationship to changes in the fair value of the security with changes in interest rates  meaning that when rates increase the value of the security will decrease 
conversely  when rates decline the value of the security will increase 
credit risk arises from the extension of credit to a counter party  for example a purchase of corporate debt in security form  and the possibility that the counter party may not meet its contractual obligations 
the company s policy is to invest in securities with low credit risk  such as us treasuries  us government agencies such as the government national mortgage association or gnma  government sponsored enterprises gse s such as the federal home loan mortgage corporation or fhlmc  state and political obligations  and mortgage backed securities 
unlike agency debt  gse debt is not secured by the full faith and credit of the united states 
the combined effect of the company s gross unrealized gains and gross unrealized losses  net of tax  is included as accumulated oci in stockholders equity  as none of the securities with gross unrealized losses are considered other than temporarily impaired 
if it is determined that an investment is impaired and the impairment is other than temporary  an impairment loss is reclassified from oci as a charge to earnings and a new carrying basis for the investment is established 
for comparative purposes  at december   gross unrealized gains of million and gross unrealized losses of million were included in the securities available for sale portfolio

other loss estimates are based upon the size  quality and concentration characteristics of the various loan portfolios  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay or the company s ability to collect  and current economic and industry conditions 
the million increase in other loss estimates was primarily attributable to increased loss estimates on delinquent loans  partially offset by reduced loss estimates on loan concentrations and the impact of improved economic conditions

improvements in overall credit quality and the improving economy led to the declines in net charge offs as a percentage of average loans 
the increase in the commercial real estate loan net charge offs is attributable to charge offs of a single construction industry related credit  which totaled million in and million in the credit had a remaining loan balance of million as of december  non performing assets non performing assets consist of non accrual loans  loans days past due and still accruing  foreclosed real estate and other repossessed assets 
non performing assets totaled million as of december   a decline of million or from million at december  the million decrease consisted of an million decrease in non accrual loans  a million decrease in foreclosed real estate and a  
table of contents decrease in other foreclosed assets 
partially offsetting these declines was a million increase in loans days past due and still accruing 
the increase was primarily comprised of three credits that are well secured and in the process of collection with no significant losses expected 
total non performing assets represented and of total assets at december  and december   respectively 
in addition to the amount of non accruing and delinquent loans over days past due  management is aware that other possible credit problems of borrowers may exist 
credits are considered substandard assets due to either less than satisfactory performance history  lack of borrower s sound worth or paying capacity  or inadequate collateral 
loans classified as substandard are monitored accordingly 
as of december  and  there were million and million  respectively  in this risk category that were to days delinquent and million and million  respectively  that were to days past due

table of contents liquidity and capital management liquidity management overview liquidity management is the process by which the company  through its asset and liability committee alco and treasury function  ensures that adequate liquid funds are available to meet its financial commitments on a timely basis  at a reasonable cost and within acceptable risk tolerances 
liquidity is derived primarily from bank issued deposit growth and retention  principal and interest payments on loans  principal and interest payments  sale  maturity and prepayment of investment securities  net cash provided from operations  and access to other funding sources 
other funding sources include brokered cds  fed funds purchased lines  federal reserve bank discount window advances  fhlb advances  repurchase agreements  commercial paper and back up lines of credit  the sale or securitization of loans  balances maintained at correspondent banks  and access to other capital markets 
bank issued deposits  which exclude wholesale deposits  are considered by management to be the primary  most stable and most cost effective source of funding and liquidity 
the bank also has capacity  over time  to place additional brokered cd s as a source of mid to long term funds 
uses of liquidity include funding credit obligations to borrowers  funding of mortgage originations pending delivery to the secondary market  withdrawals by depositors  repayment of debt when due or called  maintaining adequate collateral for public deposits  paying dividends to shareholders  payment of operating expenses  funding capital expenditures and maintaining deposit reserve requirements 
overall liquidity improved during  as wholesale funding  which includes borrowings and brokered deposits  declined million 
wholesale funding represented and of total assets as of the end of and  respectively 
the company remains confident of its ability to meet and manage its short and long term liquidity needs 
investment securities portfolio scheduled maturities of the company s investment securities portfolio and the prepayment of mortgage and asset backed securities represent a significant source of liquidity 
approximately million  or  of the securities portfolio will contractually mature in see table this does not include mortgage and asset backed securities since their payment streams may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to prepay obligations  typically without penalty 
for example  scheduled maturities for  excluding mortgage and asset backed securities  were million  whereas proceeds from actual maturities  which included prepayments of mortgage and asset backed securities  were million 
this compares to proceeds of million and million in and  respectively 
loans funding of loans is the most significant liquidity need  representing of total assets as of december  since december   loans increased million 
loans held for sale  which represents mortgage origination funding awaiting delivery to the secondary market  declined million 
the scheduled repayments and maturities of loans represent a substantial source of liquidity 
table shows for selected loan categories that million in maturities are scheduled for loan growth from same store and branch expansion continue to be the greatest liquidity need of the company 
bank issued deposits bank issued deposits are the most cost effective and reliable source of liquidity for the company 
during  bank issued deposits increased million 
the increase in bank issued deposits was primarily due to the branch expansion and deposit growth initiative 
scheduled maturities of time deposits of  or more  as reflected in table  are million in  of which million are bank issued 
branch expansion the company s branch expansion strategy poses the greatest challenge to short and long term liquidity 
the branch expansion has required  and will continue to require  other sources of liquidity to fund the expected loan growth net of expected deposit growth and the remaining million authorized capital investment 
through december   branch expansion has required the funding of billion in loans while generating million in deposits 

table of contents parent company in addition to the overall liquidity needs of the consolidated company  the parent company requires adequate liquidity to pay its expenses  repay debt when due and pay stockholder dividends 
liquidity is primarily provided to the parent through the bank and other subsidiaries in the form of dividends and through commercial paper borrowings 
in  dividends from subsidiaries amounted to million  compared to million in higher dividends in were used to retire million in commercial paper that was outstanding at december  while the bank is limited in the amount of dividends it can pay  as of december   approximately million was available for payment to the parent in the form of dividends without prior regulatory approval  of which million could be paid without causing the bank to be less than well capitalized 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
other sources of liquidity as of december   other sources of readily available liquidity totaled billion and included million of fed funds lines  unused collateral sufficient to support million in federal reserve bank discount window advances  million of unpledged debt investment securities  million of unused commercial paper and backup line of credit borrowings and million of fhlb advances 
these amounts totaled million at december  the company also has capacity  over time  to place sufficient amounts of brokered cds as a source of mid to long term liquidity 
the bank s indirect auto portfolio  which at december  was million  is a potential source of liquidity through additional auto loan sales subject to eligibility criteria established by the securitization trust 
the bank also has a home equity portfolio of million 
certain of these loans could also be packaged and securitized but the bank has no current plans to do so 
other uses of liquidity at december   other potential uses of liquidity totaled billion and included million in commitments to extend credit  million in residential mortgage commitments primarily for sale to the secondary market  and million in letters of credit 
at december   these amounts totaled billion 
capital management total stockholders equity at december  was million  an increase of million or from december  the increase in stockholders equity was primarily due to a million increase in retained earnings partly offset by a million decline in accumulated other comprehensive income oci 
the decline in oci relates to changes in net unrealized gains and losses on the investment securities available for sale portfolio 
amcore paid million of cash dividends during  which represent per share  or a dividend payout ratio of

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as part of its normal operations  amcore is subject to interest rate risk on the interest earning assets it invests in primarily loans and securities and the interest bearing liabilities it funds with primarily customer deposits  brokered deposits and borrowed funds  as well as its ability to manage such risk 
fluctuations in interest rates may result in changes in the fair market values of amcore s financial instruments  cash flows and net interest income 
like most financial institutions  amcore has an exposure to changes in both short term and long term interest rates 
in the near term  amcore expects that its interest rate risk will be greater should interest rates increase 
while amcore manages other risks in its normal course of operations  such as credit and liquidity risk  it considers interest rate risk to be its most significant market risk 
other types of market risk  such as foreign currency exchange risk and commodity price risk  do not arise in the normal course of amcore s business activities and operations 
in addition  since amcore does not hold a trading portfolio  it is not exposed to significant market risk from trading activities 
during  there were no material changes in amcore s primary market risk exposures 
based upon current expectations  no material changes are anticipated in the future in the types of market risks facing amcore 
table and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements summarize amcore s market risk and interest sensitivity position as of december  the amounts and assumptions should not be relied upon as indicative of expected actual results since  like most financial institutions  amcore s net interest income can be significantly impacted by external factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to overall economic conditions  policies and actions of regulatory authorities  the amounts of and rates at which assets and liabilities re price  variances in prepayment of loans and securities other than those that are assumed  early withdrawal of deposits  exercise of call options on borrowings or securities  competition  a general rise or decline in interest rates  changes in the slope of the yield curve  changes in historical relationships between indices and balance sheet growth 
amcore s asset and liability management process is utilized to manage market and interest rate risk through structuring the balance sheet and off balance sheet positions to maximize net interest income while maintaining 
table of contents acceptable levels of risk to changes in market interest rates 
while achievement of this goal requires a balance between earnings  liquidity and interest rate risk  there are opportunities to enhance revenues through managed risk 
interest rate sensitivity analysis is performed monthly using various simulations with an asset liability modeling system 
these analyses are reviewed by the alco  whose actions attempt to minimize any sudden or sustained negative impact that interest rate movements may have on net interest income 
alco reviews the impact of liquidity  capital adequacy and rate sensitivity  among other things  and determines appropriate policy direction to maintain or meet established alco guidelines 
based upon an immediate increase in interest rates of basis points and no change in the slope of the yield curve  the potential decrease in net interest income for would be approximately million or of base forecasted net interest income 
this analysis assumes no growth in assets or liabilities and replacement of maturing instruments with like kind instruments 
at the end of  comparable assumptions would have resulted in a potential decrease in net interest income of  or 
thus  amcore s earnings at risk for rising rates have increased since the end of conversely  an immediate decrease in interest rates of basis points and no change in the slope of the yield curve would result in a potential decrease in net interest income for of million or of base forecasted net interest income 
at the end of  a similar decrease in rates would have resulted in a potential decrease in net interest income of million or 
amcore s sensitivity to declining interest rates has decreased since the end of factors that contribute to the continued negative sensitivity to declining interest rates include the negative convexity of the mortgage backed products  extended guaranteed rates on special deposit promotions  and the larger volume of floating rate commercial loans 
the amounts and assumptions used in the rising and falling rate scenarios should not be viewed as indicative of expected actual results 
in addition to rising or falling interest rates  amcore s net interest income can be significantly impacted by a variety of external factors  such as those previously noted 
in addition  as interest rates move  the alco is likely to adjust interest rate risk management strategies to limit  to the extent possible  the adverse impact that such changes in interest rates might otherwise have on amcore s net interest income  as well as maximize potential positive impacts such movements might have
