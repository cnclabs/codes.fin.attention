item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction we have historically operated and franchised fast food units featuring nathan s famous brand all beef frankfurters  crinkle cut french fried potatoes  and a variety of other menu offerings 
our nathan s brand company owned and franchised units operate under the name nathan s famous  the name first used at our original coney island restaurant opened in nathan s licensing program began in by selling packaged hot dogs and other meat products to retail customers through supermarkets or grocery type retailers for off site consumption 
during fiscal  we introduced our branded product program  which enables foodservice retailers to sell some of nathan s proprietary products outside of the realm of a traditional franchise relationship 
in conjunction with this program  foodservice operators are granted a limited use of the nathan s famous trademark with respect to the sale of hot dogs and certain other proprietary food items and paper goods 
during the fiscal year ended march   we completed two acquisitions that provided us with two highly recognized brands 
on april   we became the franchisor of the kenny rogers roasters restaurant system by acquiring the intellectual property rights  including trademarks  recipes and franchise agreements of roasters corp 
and roasters franchise corp 
on september   we acquired the remaining of the outstanding common stock of miami subs corporation we did not already own 
on february   we acquired all of the intellectual property rights  including  but not limited to  trademarks  trade names  and recipes  of the arthur treachers fish n chips brand 
our revenues are generated primarily from selling products under nathan s branded product program  operating company owned restaurants  franchising the nathan s  miami subs and kenny rogers restaurant concepts and licensing agreements for the sale of nathan s products within supermarkets 
in addition to plans for expansion through franchising and our branded product program  nathan s continues to co brand within its existing restaurant system 
currently  the arthur treacher s brand is being sold within nathan s  kenny rogers roasters and miami subs restaurants  the nathan s brand is included on the menu of miami subs and kenny rogers restaurants  while the kenny rogers roasters brand is being sold within miami subs and nathan s restaurants 
at march   nathan s owned company operated restaurants 
during the fiscal year ended march   nathan s franchised three company operated restaurants and entered into two management agreements with franchisees to operate two company operated restaurants 
during the fiscal year ended march   nathan s closed one company operated restaurant due to its lease expiration 
the remaining six restaurants are presented as continuing operations in the accompanying financial statements 
at march   our franchise system  consisting of nathan s famous  kenny rogers roasters and miami subs restaurants  included franchised units  including five units operating pursuant to management agreements  located in states and foreign countries 
we also operated six company owned units  including one seasonal location  within the new york metropolitan area 
at march  and march   our company owned restaurant system included six nathan s units  as compared to seven nathan s units at march  critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements and the notes to our consolidated financial statements contain information that is pertinent to management s discussion and analysis 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we believe the following critical accounting policies involve additional management judgment due to the sensitivity of the methods  assumptions and estimates necessary in determining the related asset and liability amounts 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  sfas no 
requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be tested annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable for impairment 
the most significant assumptions  which are used in this test  are estimates of future cash flows 
we typically use the same assumptions for this test as we use in the development of our business plans 
if these assumptions differ significantly from actual results  additional impairment charges may be required in the future 
we conducted our annual impairment tests and no goodwill or other intangible assets were determined to be impaired during the fifty two week periods ended march   march  or march  impairment of long lived assets statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  sfas no 
requires management judgments regarding the future operating and disposition plans for under performing assets  and estimates of expected realizable values for assets to be sold 
the application of sfas no 
has affected the amounts and timing of charges to operating results in recent years 
we evaluate possible impairment of each restaurant individually and record an impairment charge whenever we determine that impairment factors exist 
we consider a history of restaurant operating losses to be the primary indicator of potential impairment of a restaurant s carrying value 
during the fifty two week periods ended march  and march   no impairment charges on long lived assets were recorded 
during the fifty two week period ended march   we identified one restaurant that had been impaired and recorded impairment charges of approximately  which is included within the results of discontinued operations 
impairment of notes receivable statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  as amended  requires management judgments regarding the future collectibility of notes receivable and the underlying fair market value of collateral 
we consider the following factors when evaluating a note for impairment a indications that the borrower is experiencing business problems  such as operating losses  marginal working capital  inadequate cash flow or business interruptions  b whether the loan is secured by collateral that is not readily marketable  and or c whether the collateral is susceptible to deterioration in realizable value 
when determining possible impairment  we also assess our future intention to extend certain leases beyond the minimum lease term and the debtor s ability to meet its obligation over the projected term 
during the fifty two week periods ended march  and march   no impairment charges on notes receivable were recorded 
we previously identified certain notes receivable that had been impaired and recorded impairment charges of approximately  relating to two notes during the fifty two weeks ended march  revenue recognition sales by company owned restaurants  which are typically paid in cash by the customer  are recognized upon the performance of services 
in connection with its franchising operations  nathan s receives initial franchise fees  development fees  royalties  and in certain cases  revenue from sub leasing restaurant properties to franchisees 
franchise and area development fees  which are typically received prior to completion of the revenue recognition process  are recorded as deferred revenue 
initial franchise fees  which are non refundable  are recognized as income when substantially all services to be performed by nathan s and conditions relating to the sale of the franchise have been performed or satisfied  which generally occurs when the franchised restaurant commences operations 
the following services are typically provided by nathan s prior to the opening of a franchised restaurant approval of all site selections to be developed 
provision of architectural plans suitable for restaurants to be developed 
assistance in establishing building design specifications  reviewing construction compliance  and equipping the restaurant 
provision of appropriate menus to coordinate with the restaurant design and location to be developed 
provide management training for the new franchisee and selected staff 
assistance with the initial operations of restaurants being developed 
development fees are non refundable and the related agreements require the franchisee to open a specified number of restaurants in the development area within a specified time period or nathan s may cancel the agreements 
revenue from development agreements is deferred and recognized as restaurants in the development area commence operations on a pro rata basis to the minimum number of restaurants required to be open  or at the time the development agreement is effectively canceled 
nathan s recognizes franchise royalties when they are earned and deemed collectible 
franchise fees and royalties that are not deemed to be collectible are not recognized as revenue until paid by the franchisee  or until collectibility is deemed to be reasonably assured 
the number of non performing units is determined by analyzing the number of months that royalties have been paid during a period 
when royalties have been paid for less than the majority of the time frame reported  such location is deemed non performing 
accordingly  the number of non performing units may differ between the quarterly results and year to date results 
revenue from sub leasing properties is recognized as income as the revenue is earned and becomes receivable and deemed collectible 
sub lease rental income is presented net of associated lease costs in the consolidated statements of earnings 
nathan s recognizes revenue from the branded product program when it is determined that the products have been delivered via third party common carrier to nathans customers 
nathan s recognizes revenue from royalties on the licensing of the use of its name on certain products produced and sold by outside vendors 
the use of nathan s name and symbols must be approved by nathan s prior to each specific application to ensure proper quality and project a consistent image 
revenue from license royalties is recognized when it is earned and deemed collectible 
in the normal course of business  we extend credit to franchisees for the payment of ongoing royalties and to trade customers of our branded product program 
notes and accounts receivable  net  as shown on our consolidated balance sheets are net of allowances for doubtful accounts 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is determined through analysis of the aging of accounts receivable at the date of the financial statements  assessment of collectibility based upon historical trends and an evaluation of the impact of current and projected economic conditions 
in the event that the collectibility of a receivable at the date of the transaction is doubtful  the associated revenue is not recorded until the facts and circumstances change in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
self insurance liabilities we are self insured for portions of our general liability coverage 
as part of our risk management strategy  our insurance programs include deductibles for each incident and in the aggregate for each policy year 
as such  we accrue estimates of our ultimate self insurance costs throughout the policy year 
these estimates have been developed based upon our historical trends  however  the final cost of some claims may not be known for five years or longer 
accordingly  our annual self insurance costs may be subject to adjustment from previous estimates as facts and circumstances change 
the self insurance accrual at march  and march  was  and  respectively 
during the fifty two weeks ended march  and march   we reversed approximately  and  respectively  of previously recorded insurance accruals to reflect the revised estimated cost of claims 
also  during the fifty two weeks ended march   we reversed approximately  of previously recorded insurance accruals for items that were concluded without further payment

on october   hurricane wilma hit southern florida where our franchisees operated restaurants 
most of these restaurants were affected by the storm and were temporarily closed 
one miami subs restaurant sustained significant damage and was permanently closed 
we estimate that franchisee sales and royalties from the affected stores were reduced in the third quarter fiscal by approximately  and  respectively  due to the period that the restaurants were closed 
the foregoing reduction in royalties assumes full payment of royalties by the affected franchisees

we also paid more for beef products during the fiscal period  despite the softening of the market during the second half of fiscal commodity costs of our hot dogs  which have increased for the third consecutive year  were approximately higher during the fiscal period than the fiscal period 
these commodity cost increases caused us to increase our selling prices beginning in june in an effort to reduce the margin pressure that we continued to experience 
the cost of restaurant sales at our six comparable units including one seasonal restaurant was  or of restaurant sales as compared to  or of restaurant sales in the fiscal period 
this reduction was primarily due to lower labor and associated costs

we currently maintain a  uncommitted bank line of credit and have never borrowed any funds under this line of credit 
seasonality our business is affected by seasonal fluctuations  the effects of weather and economic conditions 
historically  restaurant sales from company owned restaurants  franchised restaurants from which royalties are earned and the company s earnings have been highest during our first two fiscal quarters with the fourth fiscal quarter typically representing the slowest period 
this seasonality is primarily attributable to weather conditions in the marketplace for our company owned and franchised nathan s restaurants  which is principally the new york metropolitan area 
as a result of the changing composition of the miami subs restaurant system  sales  and the resulting royalties derived  are less seasonally dependant despite the ongoing concentration of restaurants being located in florida 
notwithstanding the continued growth of our branded product program and the reduced number of our company owned restaurants  we believe that future revenues and profits will continue to be highest during our first two fiscal quarters with the fourth fiscal quarter representing the slowest period 
inflationary impact we believe that general inflation has not materially impacted earnings during the past three years 
nevertheless  during that period of time our commodity costs for beef have increased significantly while other costs have increased slightly 
beginning with fiscal  throughout fiscal and into the first half of fiscal  the price of our beef products rose dramatically over historical norms before softening somewhat during the second half of fiscal as previously discussed  nathan s has increased prices in response to the increased commodity costs 
in addition  during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  we have realized the impact of higher oil prices in the form of higher distribution costs for our products and utility costs in our company owned restaurants 
from time to time  various federal and new york state legislators have proposed changes to the minimum wage requirements 
effective january   the federal minimum wage was increased from to per hour 
this increase has not had a material impact on our results of operations or financial position as the vast majority of our employees were not affected by this increase 
although we only operate six company owned restaurants  we believe that significant increases in the minimum wage could have a significant financial impact on our financial results and the results of our franchisees 
continued increases in labor  food and other operating expenses could adversely affect our operations and those of the restaurant industry and we might have to further reconsider our pricing strategy as a means to offset reduced operating margins 
the company s business  financial condition  operating results and cash flows can be impacted by a number of factors  including but not limited to those set forth above in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results 
for a discussion identifying additional risk factors and important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated  also see the discussions in forward looking statements  risk factors and notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk cash and cash equivalents we have historically invested our cash and cash equivalents in short term  fixed rate  highly rated and highly liquid instruments  which are reinvested when they mature throughout the year 
although our existing investments are not considered at risk with respect to changes in interest rates or markets for these instruments  our rate of return on short term investments could be affected at the time of reinvestment as a result of intervening events 
as of march   nathans cash and cash equivalents aggregated  earnings on these cash and cash equivalents would increase or decrease by approximately  per annum for each change in interest rates 
marketable investment securities we have invested our marketable investment securities in intermediate term  fixed rate  highly rated and highly liquid instruments 
these investments are subject to fluctuations in interest rates 
as of march   the market value of nathans marketable investment securities aggregated  interest income on these marketable investment securities would increase or decrease by approximately  per annum for each change in interest rates 
the following chart presents the hypothetical changes in the fair value of the marketable investment securities held at march  that are sensitive to interest rate fluctuations in thousands valuation of securities given an interest rate decrease of x basis points fair valuation of securities given an interest rate increase of x basis points bps bps bps value bps bps bps municipal notes and bonds borrowings the interest rate on our borrowings is generally determined based upon the prime rate and may be subject to market fluctuation as the prime rate changes as determined within each specific agreement 
we do not anticipate entering into interest rate swaps or other financial instruments to hedge our borrowings 
at march   total outstanding debt  which was comprised solely of capital leases  aggregated  none of which is at risk due to changes in interest rates 
nathan s also maintains a  credit line at the prime rate as of march  
the company has never borrowed any funds under its credit lines 
accordingly  the company does not believe that fluctuations in interest rates would have a material impact on its financial results 
commodity costs the cost of commodities are subject to market fluctuation 
we have not attempted to hedge against fluctuations in the prices of the commodities we purchase using future  forward  option or other instruments 
as a result  our future commodities purchases are subject to changes in the prices of such commodities 
generally  we attempt to pass through permanent increases in our commodity prices to our customers  thereby reducing the impact of long term increases on our financial results 
beginning with fiscal  throughout fiscal and into the first half of fiscal  the price of our beef products rose dramatically over historical norms before softening somewhat during the second half of fiscal the increases were initially caused by reductions in the supply of beef primarily due to the prohibition since may on importing of canadian beef livestock into the us  the decrease in imports of australian beef due to local drought conditions and the export of united states beef had increased through december  when the first case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy  otherwise known as bse in the united states was reported 
although the export of beef by the united states was significantly reduced as a result of this finding  beef costs have continued to rise  hitting a high during june during  the canadian border was partially re opened to the beef trade to allow importing canadian beef that is less than months old into the united states 
as a result  supply has increased and the price of beef has been somewhat lowered
