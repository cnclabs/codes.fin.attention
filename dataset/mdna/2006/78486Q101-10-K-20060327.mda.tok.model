for  we paid interest expense of million on the junior subordinated debentures 
however  the fair value hedge agreement provided a benefit of million  resulting in net interest expense of million for our monitoring activities related to managing interest rate risk include both interest rate sensitivity gap analysis and the use of a simulation model 
while traditional gap analysis provides a simple picture of the interest rate risk embedded in the balance sheet  it provides only a static view of interest rate sensitivity at a specific point in time and does not measure the potential volatility in forecasted results relating to changes in market interest rates over time 
accordingly  we combine the use of gap analysis with use of a simulation model that provides a dynamic assessment of interest rate sensitivity 
interest rate sensitivity analysis the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets and interest sensitive liabilities that are anticipated to re price within a specific time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest sensitive liabilities re pricing within that same time period 
positive cumulative gaps in early time periods suggest that earnings will increase when interest rates rise 
negative cumulative gaps suggest that earnings will increase when interest rates fall 
the gap analysis as of december  indicates that the cumulative one year gap as a percentage of interest earning assets was a positive 
the following table illustrates our interest rate sensitivity gap positions at december  assets and liabilities which mature or reprice immediately day to month after month to months after months to months after months to year after year to years after years not stated total dollars in thousands assets cash and due from bank federal funds sold  securities purchased under agreement to resell and other short term investments investment securities us treasury and agencies obligations collateralized mortgage obligations  mortgage backed and asset backed securities other debt  marketable equity and non marketable securities total investment securities loans  net of unearned income allowance for loan losses other assets total assets liabilities  minority interest and stockholders equity deposits noninterest bearing demand now and money market time total deposits contingently convertible debt junior subordinated debentures other borrowings other liabilities minority interest in capital of consolidated affiliates stockholders equity total liabilities  minority interest  and stockholders equity off balance sheet items interest rate swap gap cumulative gap includes interest bearing deposits in other financial institutions of million as of december  principal cash flows are based on estimated principal payments as of december  maturity repricing columns for fixed rate loans are based upon the amount and timing of related principal payments as of december  market value of portfolio equity mvpe one application of the aforementioned simulation model involves measurement of the impact of market interest rate changes on the net present value of estimated cash flows from our assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet items  defined as our market value of portfolio equity mvpe 
the following table presents our mvpe exposure at december  and  related to an instantaneous and sustained increase or decrease in market interest rates of and basis points  respectively 
estimated estimated increase decrease in mvpe estimated net interest estimated increase decrease in net interest income change in interest rates basis points mvpe amount percent income amount percent dollars in thousands december  december  the preceding table indicates that at december   in the event of an instantaneous and sustained increase or decrease in market interest rates  our mvpe would be expected to increase or decrease accordingly 
the market value calculations supporting the results in the preceding table are based on the present value of estimated cash flows using both market interest rates provided by independent broker dealers and other publicly available sources that we deem reliable 
these calculations do not contemplate any changes that we could make to reduce our mvpe exposure in response to a change in market interest rates 
as with any method of measuring interest rate risk  certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the preceding table 
for example  although certain of our assets and liabilities may have similar maturity or re pricing profiles  they may react to changes in market interest rates with different magnitudes 
also  actual prepayment rates on loans and investments could vary substantially from the assumptions utilized in the model to derive the results as presented in the preceding table 
further  a change in the shape of the forward yield curve could result in different mvpe estimations from those presented herein 
accordingly  the results in the preceding table should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results in the event of changing market interest rates 
additionally  the resulting mvpe estimates are not intended to represent  and should not be construed to represent the underlying value 
our mvpe exposure at december   increased slightly from december   primarily due to changes in the investment portfolio while staying well within our policy guidelines 
in addition  our net interest income at risk remains well within policy limits 
these estimates are highly assumption dependent and will change regularly as our asset liability structure changes and as different interest rate environments evolve 
we expect to continue to manage our interest rate risk actively utilizing on and off balance sheet strategies as appropriate 
the simulation model also gives us the ability to simulate our net interest income using an interest rate forecast simple simulation 
in order to measure the sensitivity of our forecasted net interest income to changing interest rates utilizing the simple simulation methodology  both a rising and falling interest rate scenario are projected and compared to a base market interest rate forecast derived from the current yield curve 
for the rising and falling interest rate scenarios  the base market interest rate forecast is increased or decreased  as applicable  by basis points in equal increments over a one year period 
we perform net interest income and net income simulations in an interest rate environment whereby we shock the base rate immediately both up and down basis points in basis point increments 
the combination of the ramp and shock scenarios provides us with additional information with respect to our sensitivity to interest rates and the impact on our net income under varied interest rate scenarios 
our policy guidelines provide that the difference between a base market interest rate forecast scenario over the succeeding one year period compared with the aforementioned rising and falling interest rate scenarios over the same time period should not result in net interest income degradation exceeding 
simulations as of december   indicated that we were well within these policy guidelines 
interest rate risk is the most significant market risk impacting us 
other types of market risk affecting us in the normal course of our business activities include foreign currency exchange risk  equity price risk  and basis risk 
the impact resulting from these market risks is not considered significant  and no separate quantitative information concerning market rate and price exposure is presented herein 
graphic report of independent registered public accounting firm the board of directors and stockholders svb financial group formerly known as silicon valley bancshares we have audited management s assessment  included in the accompanying management s report on internal control over financial reporting item a b  that svb financial group formerly known as silicon valley bancshares and subsidiaries the company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of december   because of the effect of the material weaknesses identified in management s assessment  based on criteria established in internal control integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso 
the company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting 
our responsibility is to express an opinion on management s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 
we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states 
those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects 
our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting  evaluating management s assessment  testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control  and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances 
we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 
a company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
a company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that  in reasonable detail  accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company  provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company  and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition  use  or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 
because of its inherent limitations  internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements 
also  projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions  or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 
a material weakness is a control deficiency  or combination of control deficiencies  that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected 
management identified and included in its assessment the following material weaknesses as of december  the company did not have adequately designed internal controls in its financial reporting process related to the selection and application of us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
specifically  accounting policies  procedures and practices were not consistently developed  maintained or updated in a manner ensuring that financial statements were prepared in accordance with gaap 
also  policies and procedures were not designed to consistently ensure the preparation and retention of adequate documentation to support key judgments made in connection with the selection and application of significant accounting policies within the company s financial reporting process 
finally  the company s policies and procedures did not consistently provide for effective analysis  implementation  and documentation of new accounting pronouncements 
the company did not maintain sufficient levels of appropriately qualified and trained personnel in its financial reporting processes 
as a result  the company did not establish internal control over financial reporting policies and procedures related to a the timely preparation of comprehensive documentation supporting management s analysis of the appropriate accounting treatment for warrant derivative assets or other non routine or complex transactions  and b the review of such documentation by qualified internal staff  assisted by external advisors as deemed necessary  to determine its completeness and the propriety of the company s conclusions 
these material weaknesses resulted in the restatement  in december  of the previously issued consolidated financial statements as of december  and  and for each of the years in the three year period ended december   and the interim consolidated financial information for each of the quarterly periods in and and the quarterly period ended march  specifically  these material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting as of december   resulted in the following accounting errors derivative equity warrant assets with net share settlement provisions were not reported as derivatives in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended 
specifically  the company failed to properly reflect the fair value of equity warrant assets with net settlement terms received during lending activity in its consolidated balance sheet  the change in fair value of the equity warrant assets in the income statement and the accretion of the grant date fair value of equity warrant assets to interest income as a yield adjustment 
initial non refundable corporate finance fees were not reported in accordance with the provisions of staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
specifically  the company failed to defer recognition of initial upfront non refundable retainers received upon execution of engagement letters to provide mergers and acquisitions advisory services until the completion of all contractual obligations pursuant to the terms of the engagement letters or upon receipt or notification of an engagement termination letter 
non refundable loan fees and costs associated with the company s lending products and fees associated with letters of credit were not reported in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for nonrefundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans and initial direct costs of leases 
specifically  the company failed to recognize net fee revenue in accordance with the appropriate straight line or interest method  as prescribed by sfas no 
 for net loan fee income obtained in connection with the extension of lending products 
in addition  the company inappropriately recognized non refundable loan fees it receives for factoring loans immediately rather than deferring and amortizing fees over the term of the facility granted 
the company did not properly defer direct loan origination costs associated with originating certain loan products 
in addition  the company misclassified fees on certain letters of credit as interest income rather than non interest income on commitments where the probability of exercise was deemed remote 
certain investment securities that were readily convertible to known amounts of cash and present insignificant risk of changes in value with original or purchased maturity dates of days or less  were not reported as cash equivalents in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
this misapplication of gaap resulted in a reclassification in the company s consolidated balance sheets of money market mutual fund investments and commercial paper investments from investment securities to federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreement to resell and other short term investment securities 
current federal income taxes receivable and current federal income tax payable were not reflected net on the company s balance sheets 
this misapplication of gaap resulted in a change to the company s other assets and other liabilities 
current federal income taxes receivable and current federal income taxes payable should be netted as the company has the legal right of offset  as defined by fin no 
 offsetting of amounts related to certain contracts 
we also have audited  in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states  the consolidated balance sheets of the company as of december  and  and the related consolidated statements of income  comprehensive income  stockholders equity and cash flows for each of years in the three year period ended december  the aforementioned material weaknesses were considered in determining the nature  timing and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the consolidated financial statements  and this report does not affect our report dated march   which expressed an unqualified opinion on these consolidated financial statements 
in our opinion  management s assessment that the company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of december   is fairly stated  in all material respects  based on criteria established in internal control integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso 
also  in our opinion  because of the effect of the material weaknesses described above on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria  the company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of december   based on criteria established in internal control integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso
