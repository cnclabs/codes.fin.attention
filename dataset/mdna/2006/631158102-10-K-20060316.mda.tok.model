item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this report 
competition food distribution segment competition is intense among the distributors in the food distribution segment as evidenced by the low margin nature of the business 
success in this segment is measured by the ability to leverage scale in order to gain pricing advantages and operating efficiencies  to provide superior merchandising programs and services to the independent customer base and to use technology to increase distribution efficiencies 
we compete with local  regional and national food distributors  as well as with vertically integrated national and regional chains using a variety of formats  including supercenters  supermarkets and warehouse clubs that purchase directly from suppliers and self distribute products to their stores 
we face competition from these companies on the basis of price  quality  variety and availability of products  strength of private label brands  schedules and reliability of deliveries  and the range and quality of customer services 
continuing our quality service by focusing on key metrics such as our on time delivery rate  fill rate  and selector accuracy is essential in maintaining our competitive advantage 
we believe we are an industry leader in on time delivery rate  fill rate and selector accuracy  which were   and  respectively  for fiscal military segment we are one of six distributors with annual sales to the deca commissary system in excess of million 
we estimate that over of deca s purchases from distributors are made through these six distributors 
the remaining distributors that supply deca tend to be smaller  local providers 
in addition  manufacturers contract with others to deliver certain products  primarily fresh meat  poultry  produce  deli items  soft drinks and snack items  directly to deca commissaries 
because of the narrow margins in this industry  it is of critical importance for distributors to achieve economies of scale  which is typically a function of the density or concentration of military bases within the geographic market s a distributor serves  and the distributor s share of that market 
as a result  no distributor in this industry has a nationwide presence 
rather  distributors tend to concentrate on specific regions  or areas within specific regions  where they can achieve critical mass and utilize warehouse and distribution facilities efficiently 
in addition  distributors that operate larger civilian distribution businesses tend to compete for deca commissary business in areas where such 
table of contents business would enable them to more efficiently utilize the capacity of their existing civilian distribution centers 
we believe the principal competitive factors among distributors within this industry are customer service  price  operating efficiencies  reputation with deca and location of distribution centers 
we believe our competitive position is very strong with respect to all these factors within the geographic areas where we compete 
retail segment competition in the retail grocery business in our geographic markets is intense 
we compete with many organizations of various sizes  ranging from national and regional chains that operate a variety of formats such as supercenters  supermarkets  extreme value food stores and membership warehouse club stores to local grocery store chains and privately owned unaffiliated grocery stores 
although our target geographic areas have a relatively low presence of national and multi regional grocery store chains  we are facing increasing competitive pressure from the expansion of supercenters  primarily those operated by wal mart stores  inc  and regional chains 
during  there were thirteen new supercenters opened in markets where we operate 
depending upon the market  we compete based on price  quality and assortment  store appeal  including store location and format  sales promotions  advertising  service and convenience 
we believe our ability to provide convenience  outstanding perishable execution and exceptional customer service are particularly important factors in achieving competitive success 
vendor allowances and credits we participate with our vendors in a broad menu of promotions to increase sales of products 
these promotions fall into two main categories off invoice allowances and performance based allowances and are often subject to negotiation with our vendors 
in the case of off invoice allowances  discounts are typically offered by vendors with respect to certain merchandise purchased by us during a specified period of time 
we use off invoice allowances to support a variety of marketing programs such as reduced price offerings for specific time periods  food shows  pallet promotions and private label promotions 
the discounts are either reflected directly on the vendor invoice  as a reduction from the normal wholesale prices for merchandise to which the allowance applies  or we are allowed to deduct the allowance as an offset against the vendor s invoice when it is paid 
in the case of performance based allowances  the allowance or rebate is based on our completion of some specific activity  such as purchasing or selling product during a certain time period 
this basic performance requirement may be accompanied by an additional performance requirement such as providing advertising or special in store promotion  tracking specific shipments of goods to retailers  or to customers in the case of our own retail stores  during a specified period retail performance allowances  slotting adding a new item to the system in one or more of our distribution centers and merchandising a new item  or achieving certain minimum purchase quantities 
the billing for these performance based allowances is normally in the form of a bill back in which case we are invoiced at the regular price with the understanding that we may bill back the vendor for the requisite allowance when the performance is satisfied 
we also assess an administrative fee  reflected on the invoices sent to vendors  to recoup our reasonable costs of performing the tasks associated with administering retail performance allowances 
we collectively plan promotions with our vendors and arrive at the amount the respective vendor plans to spend on promotions with us 
each vendor has its own method for determining the amount of promotional funds budgeted to be spent with us during the period 
in most situations  the vendor allowances are based on units we purchased from the vendor 
in other situations  the allowances are based on our past or anticipated purchases and or the anticipated performance of the planned promotions 
forecasting promotional expenditures is a critical part of our frequently scheduled planning sessions with our vendors 
as individual promotions are completed and the associated billing is processed  the vendors track our promotional program execution and spend rate  and discuss the tracking  performance and spend rate with us on a regular basis throughout the year  which may be weekly  monthly  quarterly or annually 
these communications include future promotions  product cost  targeted retails and price points  anticipated volume  promotion expenditures  vendor maintenance  billing issues and procedures  new items discontinued items  and trade spend levels relative to budget 
table of contents per event and per year  as well as the resolution of any issues that arise between the vendor and us 
in the future  the nature and menu of promotional programs and the allocation of dollars among them may change as a result of ongoing negotiations and commercial relationships between vendors and us 
trademarks and servicemarks we own or license a number of trademarks  tradenames and servicemarks that relate to our products and services  including those mentioned in this report 
we consider certain of these trademarks  tradenames and servicemarks  such as our family and value choice  to be of material value to the business conducted by our food distribution and retail segments  and we actively defend and enforce such trademarks  tradenames and servicemarks 
employees as of december   we employed  persons  of whom  were employed on a full time basis and  employed on a part time basis 
of our total number of employees  are represented by unions and consist primarily of warehouse personnel and drivers in our ohio  indiana and michigan distribution centers 
we consider our employee relations to be good

item a 
risk factors in addition to the other information in this form k  you should carefully consider the specific risk factors set forth below in evaluating nash finch because any of the following risks could materially affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and future prospects 
the risks described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us may also materially and adversely affect us 
we face substantial competition and our competitors may have superior resources  which could place us at a competitive disadvantage 
the food distribution and retail businesses are intensely competitive  characterized by high inventory turnover  narrow profit margins and increasing consolidation 
our food distribution business competes not only with local  regional and national food distributors  but also with vertically integrated national and regional chains that employ a variety of formats  including supercenters  supermarkets and warehouse clubs 
our retail business  focused in the upper midwest  has historically competed with traditional grocery stores and is increasingly competing with alternative store formats such as supercenters primarily those operated by wal mart  warehouse clubs  dollar stores and extreme value food stores 
the military food distribution business is also highly competitive 
because of the narrow margins in the military food distribution industry  it is of critical importance for distributors to achieve economies of scale  
table of contents which is typically a function of the density or concentration of military bases in the geographic markets a distributor serves and a distributor s share of that market 
as a result  no distributor in this industry has a nationwide presence and it is very difficult  other than through acquisitions  to expand operations in this industry beyond the geographic regions where we currently can utilize our warehouse and distribution capacity 
we face competition in our military business from large national and regional food distributors as well as smaller food distributors 
some of our competitors are substantially larger and may have greater financial resources and geographic scope  lower merchandise acquisition costs and lower operating expenses than we do  intensifying price competition at the wholesale and retail levels 
industry consolidation and the expansion of alternative store formats  which have gained and continue to gain market share at the expense of traditional grocery stores  tend to produce even stronger competition for our food retail business and for the independent customers of our distribution business 
to the extent our independent customers are acquired by our competitors or are not successful in competing with other retail chains and non traditional competitors  sales by our distribution business will also be affected 
if we fail to effectively implement strategies to respond to these competitive pressures  our operating results could be adversely affected by price reductions  decreased sales or margins  or loss of market share 
our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected if we are unable to improve the competitive position of our retail operations 
primarily due to intensely competitive conditions  same store sales in our retail business decreased during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year  and in fiscal as compared to the fiscal year we are taking or expect to take initiatives of varying scope and duration with a view toward improving our response to and performance under these difficult competitive conditions 
to complement these initiatives  we periodically evaluate and assess strategic alternatives for retail stores that could be operated more profitably by independent customers of our food distribution segment or that otherwise do not meet return objectives  provide long term strategic opportunities or justify additional capital investments 
as a result of this process we expect to continue to downsize our retail segment through opportunistic sales of retail stores to existing or prospective food distribution customers and by closing underperforming stores as deemed necessary or as leases expire 
in connection with these efforts  there are numerous risks and uncertainties  including our ability to successfully identify which course of action will be most financially advantageous for each retail store  our ability to identify those initiatives that will be the most effective in improving the competitive position of the retail stores we retain  our ability to efficiently and timely implement these initiatives  and the response of competitors to these initiatives 
if we are unable to improve the overall competitive position of our remaining retail stores and dispose of other stores in an advantageous or cost effective manner  the operating performance of that segment may continue to decline  we may have to recognize additional impairments of our long lived assets and goodwill  and we may be compelled to close or dispose of additional stores and may incur restructuring or other charges to our earnings associated with such closure and disposition activities 
in addition  we cannot assure you that we will be able to replace any of the revenue lost from these closed or sold stores from our other operations 
we may not be able to achieve the expected benefits of the operations we acquired from roundy s due to factors such as the inability to successfully integrate those operations into our business or to retain its customer base  which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
achieving the expected benefits of the distribution operations we acquired from roundy s in march will depend in large part on factors such as our ability to successfully integrate such operations and personnel in a timely and efficient manner and to retain the customer base of the acquired operations 
if we cannot successfully integrate these operations and retain its customer base  we may experience material adverse consequences to our results of operations and financial condition 
the integration of separately managed businesses operating in different markets involves a number of risks  including the following demands on management related to the significant increase in our size after the acquisition of these operations  
table of contents difficulties in the assimilation of different corporate cultures and business practices  such as those involving vendor promotions  and of geographically dispersed personnel and operations  difficulties in the integration of departments  information technology systems  technologies  books and records and procedures  as well as in maintaining uniform standards and controls  including internal accounting controls  procedures and policies  and expenses of any undisclosed liabilities  such as those involving environmental or legal matters 
successful integration of these new operations will depend on our ability to manage those operations  fully assimilate them into our distribution network  realize opportunities for revenue growth presented by strengthened product offerings and expanded geographic market coverage  maintain the customer base and  to some degree  eliminate redundant and excess costs 
we may not realize the anticipated benefits or savings from the acquisition to the extent or in the time frame anticipated  if at all  or such benefits and savings may include higher costs than anticipated 
substantial operating losses may occur if the customers to whom we extend credit or for whom we guarantee loan or lease obligations fail to repay us 
in the ordinary course of business  we extend credit  including loans  to our food distribution customers  and provide financial assistance to some customers by guaranteeing their loan or lease obligations 
we also lease store sites for sublease to independent retailers 
generally  our loans and other financial accommodations are extended to small businesses that are unrated and may have limited access to conventional financing 
as of december  we had loans of million outstanding to of our food distribution customers  including million of notes receivable from one retailer  and had guaranteed outstanding debt and lease obligations of food distribution customers totaling million  including million in loan guarantees to one retailer 
in the normal course of business  we also sublease retail properties and assign retail property leases to third parties 
as of december   our maximum contingent liability exposure with respect to subleases and assigned leases was million and million  respectively 
while we seek to obtain security interests and other credit support in connection with the financial accommodations we extend  such collateral may not be sufficient to cover our exposure 
greater than expected losses from existing or future credit extensions  loans  guarantee commitments or sublease arrangements  which could result from factors such as business difficulties experienced by customers with the highest concentration of credit exposure or in times of general economic difficulty or uncertainty  could negatively and potentially materially impact our operating results and financial condition 
consumable goods distribution is sensitive to economic conditions and economic downturns or uncertainty may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the food distribution and retail industry is sensitive to national and regional economic conditions  particularly those that influence consumer confidence  spending and buying habits 
economic downturns or uncertainty may not only adversely affect overall demand and intensify price competition  but also cause consumers to trade down by purchasing lower priced  and often lower margin  items and to make fewer purchases in traditional supermarket channels 
these consumer responses  coupled with the impact of general economic factors such as increasingly volatile energy costs  prevailing interest rates  food price inflation or deflation  employment trends in our markets  and labor and energy costs  can also have a significant impact on our operating results 
increasing volatility in financial markets may cause these factors to change with a greater degree of frequency and magnitude 
our ability to operate effectively could be impaired by the risks and costs associated with the efforts to grow our business through acquisitions 
efforts to grow our distribution business may include acquisitions 
acquisitions entail various risks such as identifying suitable candidates  effecting acquisitions at acceptable rates of return  obtaining adequate financing on acceptable terms and conditions  timely and effectively integrating the operations  systems and personnel of the acquired business  the assumption of undisclosed liabilities and diversion of management s 
table of contents time and attention from other business concerns 
a failure to effectively manage these risks could increase the costs or reduce the benefits derived from expansion and  therefore  negatively impact our business and operations 
our distribution business could be negatively affected if we fail to retain existing customers or attract significant numbers of new customers 
increasing the growth and profitability of our distribution business is dependent in large measure upon our ability to retain existing customers and capture additional distribution customers through our existing network of distribution centers  enabling us to more effectively utilize the fixed assets in that business 
our ability to achieve these goals is dependent  in part  upon our ability to continue to provide a high level of customer service  offer competitive products at low prices  maintain high levels of productivity and efficiency  particularly in the process of integrating new customers into our distribution system  and offer marketing  merchandising and ancillary services that provide value to our independent customers 
if we are unable to execute these tasks effectively  we may not be able to attract significant numbers of new customers and attrition among our existing customer base could increase  either or both of which could have an adverse impact on our revenue and profitability 
changes in vendor promotions or allowances  including the way vendors target their promotional spending  and our ability to effectively manage these programs could significantly impact our margins and profitability 
we engage in a wide variety of promotional programs cooperatively with our vendors 
the nature of these programs and the allocation of dollars among them evolve over time as the parties assess the results of specific promotions and plan for future promotions 
these programs require careful management in order for us to maintain or improve margins while at the same time driving sales for us and for the vendors 
a reduction in overall promotional spending or a shift in promotional spending away from certain types of promotions that we have historically utilized could have a significant impact on our gross profit margin and profitability 
our ability to anticipate and react to changes in promotional spending by  among other things  planning and implementing alternative programs that are expected to be mutually beneficial to the manufacturers and us  will be an important factor in maintaining or improving margins and profitability 
if we are unable to effectively manage these programs  it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our debt instruments include financial and other covenants that limit our operating flexibility and that may affect our future business strategies and operating results 
covenants in the documents governing our outstanding or future debt  including our senior secured credit facility  or our future debt levels  could limit our operating and financial flexibility 
our ability to respond to market conditions and opportunities as well as capital needs could be constrained by the degree to which we are leveraged  by changes in the availability or cost of capital  and by contractual limitations on the degree to which we may  without the consent of our lenders  take actions such as engaging in mergers  acquisitions or divestitures  incurring additional debt  making capital expenditures and making investments  loans or advances 
if needs or opportunities were identified that would require financial resources beyond existing resources  obtaining those resources could increase our borrowing costs  further reduce financial flexibility  require alterations in strategies and affect future operating results 
our operations are linked to domestic and international military distribution  and a change in the military commissary system could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition 
because our military segment sells and distributes grocery products to military commissaries in the us and overseas  any material changes in the commissary system  in military staffing levels or in locations of bases may have a corresponding impact on the sales and operating performance of this segment 
these changes could include privatization of some or all of the military commissary system  relocation or consolidation in the number of commissaries  base closings  troop redeployments or consolidations in the 
table of contents geographic areas containing commissaries served by us  or a reduction in the number of persons having access to the commissaries 
the foregoing discussion of risk factors is not exhaustive  and we do not undertake to revise any forward looking statement to reflect events or circumstances that occur after the date the statement is made

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are the second largest publicly traded wholesale food distribution company in the united states 
our business consists of three primary operating segments food distribution  military and food retailing 
the four cornerstones of our strategy are to i take advantage of new business opportunities with new and existing food distribution customers to strengthen our position as one of the leading wholesale choices  ii increase our market position as a leading military distributor and extend our customer base and product offerings  iii improve returns from our existing retail operations  and iv drive shareholder value through debt reduction and return of cash to shareholders through regular dividend payments 
in addition  we may from time to time identify and evaluate acquisition opportunities in our food distribution and military segments  and to the extent we believe such opportunities present strategic benefits to those segments and can be achieved in a cost effective manner  complete such acquisitions 
our food distribution segment sells and distributes a wide variety of nationally branded and private label products to independent grocery stores and other customers primarily in the midwest and southeast regions of the united states 
on march  we completed the purchase from roundy s of the net assets  including customer contracts  of roundy s wholesale food distribution divisions in westville  indiana and lima  ohio and two retail stores in ironton  ohio and van wert  ohio for million  subject to customary post closing adjustments 
no facility closures are expected given the strategic fit of these distribution centers into the nash finch network 
to finance this acquisition  we sold million in aggregate gross proceeds of senior subordinated convertible notes due  borrowed million under the revolving credit portion of our senior secured credit facility and used cash on hand 
we believe the acquisition of the lima and westville divisions provides a valuable strategic opportunity for us to further leverage our existing relationships in the regions in which these divisions operate and to grow our food distribution business in a cost effective manner 
the demands of integrating this acquisition have  however  diverted attention and resources from our day to day operational execution and made us less aggressive in managing our core business  as discussed in more detail below 
in light of these issues  we have slowed some elements of the logistical and technical integration  and shifted additional resources to those tasks 
in combination  these factors have temporarily affected margins and delayed the realization of the financial benefit of the synergies inherent in this acquisition 
our military segment contracts with manufacturers to distribute a wide variety of grocery products to military commissaries located primarily in the mid atlantic region of the united states  and in europe  cuba  puerto rico  iceland and the azores 
we are the largest distributor of grocery products to us military commissaries  with over years of experience acting as a distributor to us military commissaries 
our retail segment operated corporate owned stores primarily in the upper midwest as of december  predominantly due to intensely competitive conditions in which supercenters and other alternative formats compete for price conscious customers  same store sales in our retail business have declined since  although the declines have moderated in more recent periods 
we are taking and expect to take initiatives of varying scope and duration with a view toward improving our response to and performance under these difficult competitive conditions 
to complement these initiatives  we periodically evaluate and assess strategic alternatives for retail stores that could be operated more profitably by customers of our food distribution segment or that otherwise do not meet return objectives  provide long term strategic opportunities or justify additional capital investments 
as a result of this process  we closed stores at the end of the second quarter of and have closed or sold additional stores since the second quarter of we expect to continue to downsize our retail segment through opportunistic sales of retail stores to existing or prospective food distribution customers and by closing underperforming stores as deemed necessary or as leases expire 
as we continue to assess the impact of performance improvement initiatives and the operating results of individual stores  we may have to recognize additional impairments of long lived assets and an impairment of goodwill associated with our retail segment  and may incur restructuring or other charges in connection with closure or sales activities

percent percent percent percent percent segment sales sales of sales change sales of sales change sales of sales food distribution military retail total sales the following table summarizes the impact on our total sales and segment sales of the additional week in the fourth fiscal quarter of in millions adjusted fiscal sales for the effect of an additional week of sales comparable rd comparable percent week weeks change segment sales sales sales of sales to food distribution military retail total sales the increase in food distribution sales in fiscal was primarily due to the acquisition of the lima and westville divisions  which added million in sales  the majority of the total increase in sales over fiscal excluding the impact of the acquisition  food distribution sales increased year to date over the prior year  primarily related to new accounts 
the increase in fiscal sales was due to new business with former fleming customers and other new accounts 
the increase in military segment sales in fiscal was largely due to increases in domestic commissary customer traffic 
the increase in fiscal was due to increased shipments throughout the domestic commissary system and overseas 
the decrease in retail sales for fiscal is attributable to the closure or sale of stores during fiscal and nine stores during fiscal  and a decline in same store sales  partially offset by the acquisition of two stores as part of the roundy s acquisition 
same store sales  which compare retail sales for stores which were in operation for the same number of weeks in the comparative periods  decreased for as compared to the decline in fiscal as compared to fiscal is due to the closure or sale of stores and a decline in same store sales of 
these declines continue to reflect a difficult competitive environment in which supercenters and other alternative formats compete for price conscious consumers 

table of contents during fiscal and  our corporate store count changed as follows fiscal year fiscal year number of stores at beginning of year acquired stores closed or sold stores number of stores at end of year gross profit gross profit calculated as sales less cost of sales for fiscal was of sales compared to for fiscal and for fiscal the decline in gross profit as a percentage of sales gross profit margin during the period was primarily due to a higher percentage of sales in the food distribution and military segments as opposed to the retail segment  which historically has a higher gross profit margin 
in the food distribution segment  inadequate execution in the management of manufacturer promotional spending  and higher than expected acquisition integration costs contributed to the gross profit margin decline during in addition  growth in our food distribution business has been obtained and will likely continue to be obtained from larger independent retailers who expect a lower cost of goods in order to compete in an ever more competitive marketplace 
in the retail segment  gross profit margins were adversely affected during by implementation of a pricing strategy that was designed to drive sales  but instead caused margin deterioration without the expected improvement in sales 
the margin deterioration in fiscal compared to fiscal was partially offset by a million decrease in the lifo charge during fiscal the decrease in the lifo charge is a result of lower food price inflation 
fiscal gross profit margins were negatively affected by a million lifo charge as compard to a million lifo credit for fiscal the lifo charge in fiscal was due to food price inflation across all categories of products 
the lifo credit in was due to food price deflation and decreased inventory levels as a result of lower sales 
the gross margin declines during in the food distribution and retail segments was partially offset by the continued realization of gross margin improvement in the military segment from the consolidation of two large warehouse facilities during fiscal selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses sg a for fiscal were of sales as compared to of sales in fiscal and of sales in fiscal this decrease in sg a expense as a percentage of sales in the period primarily reflected the fact that our retail segment  which has higher sg a expenses than our food distribution and military segments as a percentage of sales  represented a smaller percentage of our total sales in each of these periods 
additionally  during fiscal bad debt expense decreased by million from fiscal due to improved receivables management 
fiscal impairment charges of million  represented an increase of million from fiscal the impairment charges for fiscal related primarily to retail stores whose carrying values were impaired due to increased competition within the stores respective market areas 
the increase in impairment charges during fiscal was offset by a million decrease in lease costs associated with closed store operations as compared to the prior year 
gain on sale of real estate the gain on sale of real estate for was million compared to million for fiscal  a decrease of 
gain on sale of real estate for fiscal increased million  or  as compared to the gain on sale of real estate in all years was primarily related to the sale of unoccupied properties 

table of contents special charges as previously discussed  we closed stores at the end of the second quarter and sought purchasers for our three denver avanza stores 
as a result of these actions  we recorded a special charge of  million which is reflected in the special charges line within the consolidated statements of income  and million of costs reflected in operating earnings  primarily involving inventory markdowns related to the store closures 
the special charge included million in impairment charges of long lived assets  million related to lease closure costs  and million in other closure costs 
during fiscal  we decided to continue to operate the three avanza stores and therefore recorded a reversal of million of the special charge related to these stores because the assets of the stores were revalued at historical cost less depreciation during the time held for sale 
partially offsetting this reversal was a million change in estimate for other property closure costs 
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense for fiscal increased by million  or as compared to fiscal the increase was primarily caused by the increased depreciation and amortization expense related to the acquisition of the lima and westville divisions  including the amortization of a million customer contract intangible  partially offset by the closure or sale of retail stores since the first quarter of fiscal depreciation and amortization expense declined during fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to the closure of retail stores during fiscal interest expense interest expense decreased million to million in fiscal as compared to million for fiscal the decrease was largely due to a decrease in the effective interest rate from for fiscal to for fiscal because of changes in the composition of our debt as discussed in the liquidity and capital resources section below and the impact of interest rate swaps 
the effect of the decrease in our effective rate was partially offset by an increase in the average borrowing levels from million for fiscal to million for fiscal and by the payment of a million bridge loan fee during the second quarter of in connection with arrangement of our financing for the acquisition of the lima and westville divisions 
interest expense for fiscal decreased by compared to fiscal  primarily due to a decrease in average borrowing levels which was partially offset by an increase in average interest rate from to income tax expense the effective tax rate for income from continuing operations in fiscal was compared to for fiscal and for fiscal in  and we reversed million  million and million of previously established tax reserves  respectively 
these reversals were primarily the result of resolution of various federal and state tax issues and statute expirations 
refer to the tax rate table in part ii  item of this report under note income taxes of notes to the consolidated financial statements for the comparative components of these rates 
discontinued operations the net earnings from discontinued operations of million in fiscal and was a result of the resolution of a contingency associated with the sale of our nash de camp produce growing and marketing subsidiary in fiscal net earnings net earnings for the week fiscal were million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share  for the week fiscal  and million  or per diluted share  for the week year 
net earnings in each of the three years were affected by a number of events 
table of contents included in the discussion above that affected the comparability of results 
some of the more significant of these events are summarized as follows fifty two weeks fifty two weeks fifty three weeks ended december  ended january  ended january  eps eps eps net earnings from continuing operations as reported items affecting earnings bridge loan fee call premium for early redemption of senior subordinated notes write off of unamortized finance costs and original issuance discount on credit facility and senior subordinated notes special charge from store dispositions store closure cost reflected in operations q fees paid to lenders as consideration for bond indenture and credit facility waivers reduction of health insurance expense reduction in income tax expense liquidity and capital resources historically  we have financed our capital needs through a combination of internal and external sources 
we expect that cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs and enable us to reduce our debt  with temporary draws on our revolving credit line needed during the year to build inventories for certain holidays 
longer term  we believe that cash flows from operations  short term bank borrowings  various types of long term debt and lease and equity financing will be adequate to meet our working capital needs  planned capital expenditures and debt service obligations 
operating cash flows were million for fiscal  a decrease of million from million for fiscal the primary reason for the decrease in operating cash flows for fiscal as compared to the same period last year was an increase of million in inventories primarily due to new business and the integration of the westville and lima divisions 
cash flow from operations decreased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal due to costs related to the special charge 
partially offsetting these costs was a decrease in inventories of approximately million  million of which related to the retail store closures 
an increase in accounts receivable from the prior year was more than offset by an increase in accounts payable 
cash used for investing activities increased by in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily because of the acquisition of the lima and westville divisions 
cash used for investing activities decreased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal  mostly due to a decrease in net additions to property  plant and equipment of million 
cash provided by financing activities was million for fiscal as compared to million of cash used in financing activities during fiscal financing activities for fiscal primarily included proceeds from the private placement of million in aggregate issue price of senior subordinated convertible notes and net receipts from revolving debt of million to finance the acquisition of the westville and lima divisions 
cash used for financing in fiscal reflected early extinguishment of the

lease obligations primarily relate to store locations for our retail segment  as well as store locations subleased to independent food distribution customers 
a discussion of lease commitments can be found in part ii  item in this report under note leases in notes to consolidated financial statements and under the caption lease commitments under critical accounting policies  below 
includes amounts classified as imputed interest 
the majority of our purchase obligations involve purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business  which are not included in the table above 
our purchase orders are based on our current needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within very short time horizons 
any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders are reflected in our consolidated balance sheet as accounts payable upon shipment of the underlying product 
the purchase obligations shown in this table also exclude agreements that are cancelable by us without significant penalty  which include contracts for routine outsourced services 
the amount of purchase obligations shown in the table represents the amount of product we are contractually obligated to purchase to earn million in upfront contract monies received 
should we not be able to fulfill these purchase obligations  we would be only obligated to pay back the unearned upfront contract monies 
we have not included obligations under our pension and postretirement medical benefit plans in the contractual obligations table 
as of december  we had a pension funding obligation of million as discussed further in part ii  item in this report under note pension and other post retirement benefits 

table of contents we have also made certain commercial commitments that extend beyond these commitments include standby letters of credit and guarantees of certain food distribution customer debt and lease obligations 
the following summarizes these commitments as of december  commitment expiration per period total amounts less than over other commercial commitments committed year years years years in thousands standby letters of credit guarantees total other commercial commitments letters of credit relate primarily to supporting workers compensation obligations and are renewable annually 
refer to part ii  item of this report under note concentration of credit risk of notes to consolidated financial statements and under the caption guarantees of debt and lease obligations of others under critical accounting policies  below  for additional information regarding debt  lease guarantees and assigned leases 
senior secured credit facility our senior secured bank credit facility consists of million in revolving credit  all of which may be used for loans and up to million of which may be used for letters of credit  and a million term loan b 
the facility is secured by a security interest in substantially all assets of the company and its wholly owned subsidiaries that are not pledged under other debt agreements 
the revolving credit portion of the facility has a five year term and the term loan b has a six year term 
borrowings under the facility bear interest at either the eurodollar rate or the prime rate  plus in either case a margin spread that is dependent on our total leverage ratio 
we pay a commitment commission on the unused portion of the revolver 
the margin increase and the commitment commission are reset quarterly based on movement of a leverage ratio defined by the applicable credit agreement 
at january and december  the margin for the revolver and term loan b were and  respectively and the commitment commission was 
the credit facility requires us to hedge a certain portion of such borrowings through the use of interest rate swaps  as we have done historically 
on february   we entered into a first amendment to our credit facility permitting us to enter into the asset purchase agreement with roundy s and to close and finance the acquisition of the lima and westville divisions 
our senior secured credit facility represents one of our primary sources of liquidity  both short term and long term  and the continued availability of credit under that facility is of material importance to our ability to fund our capital and working capital needs 
the credit agreement governing the credit facility contains various restrictive covenants  compliance with which is essential to continued credit availability 
among the most significant of these restrictive covenants are financial covenants which require us to maintain predetermined ratio levels related to interest coverage and leverage 
these ratios are based on ebitda  on a rolling four quarter basis  with some adjustments consolidated ebitda 
consolidated ebitda is a non gaap financial measure that is defined in our bank credit agreement as earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  adjusted to exclude extraordinary gains or losses  gains or losses from sales of assets other than inventory in the ordinary course of business  upfront fees and expenses incurred in connection with the execution and delivery of the credit agreement  and non cash charges such as lifo charges  closed store lease costs and asset impairments  less cash payments made during the current period on certain non cash charges recorded in prior periods 
in addition  for purposes of determining compliance with prescribed leverage ratios and adjustments in the credit facility s margin spread and commitment commission  consolidated ebitda is calculated on a pro forma basis that takes into account all permitted acquisitions  such as the acquisition of the lima and westville divisions  that have occurred since the beginning of the relevant four 
table of contents quarter computation period 
consolidated ebitda should not be considered an alternative measure of our net income  operating performance  cash flow or liquidity 
it is provided as additional information relative to compliance with our debt covenants 
in addition  the credit agreement requires us to maintain predetermined ratio levels related to working capital coverage the ratio of the sum of net trade accounts receivable plus inventory to the sum of loans and letters of credit outstanding under the new credit agreement plus up to million of additional secured indebtedness permitted to be issued under the new credit agreement 
the credit agreement initially requires us to maintain an interest coverage ratio of at fiscal year end and increasing to at fiscal year end and thereafter  a leverage ratio of at fiscal year end  stepping down to at fiscal year end and to at fiscal year end and thereafter  and a working capital ratio of at fiscal year end  stepping up to at fiscal year end and to at fiscal year end and thereafter 
we must also maintain a senior secured leverage ratio total unsubordinated secured debt to consolidated ebitda of at fiscal year end  stepping down to at fiscal year end  and to at fiscal year end and thereafter 
as of december   we were in compliance with all financial covenants as defined in our credit agreement which are summarized as follows financial covenant required ratio actual ratio interest coverage ratio minimum leverage ratio maximum senior secured leverage ratio maximum working capital ratio minimum ratio of consolidated ebitda for the trailing four quarters to interest expense for such period 
total outstanding debt to consolidated ebitda for the trailing four quarters 
total outstanding senior secured debt to consolidated ebitda for the trailing four quarters 
ratio of net trade accounts receivable plus inventory to the sum of loans and letters of credit outstanding under the new credit agreement plus certain additional secured debt 
any failure to comply with any of these financial covenants would constitute an event of default under the bank credit agreement  entitling a majority of the bank lenders to  among other things  terminate future credit availability under the agreement and accelerate the maturity of outstanding obligations under that agreement

convertible subordinated debt on march  we completed a private placement of million in aggregate issue price or million aggregate principal amount at maturity of senior subordinated convertible notes due the funds were used to finance a portion of the acquisition of the lima and westville divisions from roundy s 
the notes are unsecured senior subordinated obligations and rank junior to our existing and future senior indebtedness  including borrowings under our senior secured credit facility 
cash interest at the rate of per year is payable semi annually on the issue price of the notes until march  after that date  cash interest will not be payable  unless contingent cash interest becomes payable  and original issue discount for non tax purposes will accrue on the notes at a daily rate of per year until the maturity date of the notes 
on the maturity date of the notes  a holder will receive  per note 
contingent cash interest will be paid on the notes during any six month period  commencing march   if the average market price of a note for a ten trading day measurement period preceding the applicable six month period equals or more of the accreted principal amount of the note  plus accrued cash interest  if any 
the contingent cash interest payable with respect to any six month period will equal an annual rate of of the average market price of the note for the ten trading day measurement period described above 
the notes will be convertible at the option of the holder  only upon the occurrence of certain events  at an initial conversion rate of shares of the company s common stock per  principal amount at maturity of notes equal to an initial conversion price of approximately per share 
upon conversion  the company will pay the holder the conversion value in cash up to the accreted principal amount of the note and the excess conversion value  if any  in cash  stock or a combination of both  at the company s option 
the company may redeem all or a portion of the notes for cash at any time on or after the eighth anniversary of the issuance of the notes 
holders may require the company to purchase for cash all or a portion of their notes on the th  th  th  th and th anniversaries of the issuance of the notes 
in addition  upon specified change in control events  each holder will have the option  subject to certain limitations  to require the company to purchase for cash all or any portion of such holder s notes 
in connection with the closing of the sale of the notes  the company entered into a registration rights agreement with the initial purchasers of the notes 
in accordance with that agreement  the company filed with the securities and exchange commission on july  a shelf registration statement covering resales by 
table of contents security holders of the notes and the common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes 
the shelf registration statement was declared effective by the securities and exchange commission on october  redemption of senior subordinated notes on december   we redeemed the million in senior subordinated notes the notes due at a redemption price of  plus accrued and unpaid interest on the notes as of the redemption date 
we drew under the term loan b to fund the redemption of these notes 
charges recorded during the fourth fiscal quarter of for redemption of the notes and the refinancing of our credit facility included a call premium of million and million for unamortized finance costs and original issue discount charge 
debt obligations generally for debt obligations  the following table presents principal cash flows  related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates and fair value as of december  fixed rate variable rate fair value amount rate fair value amount rate in thousands thereafter derivative instruments we have market risk exposure to changing interest rates primarily as a result of our borrowing activities and commodity price risk associated with anticipated purchases of diesel fuel 
our objective in managing our exposure to changes in interest rates and commodity prices is to reduce fluctuations in earnings and cash flows 
to achieve these objectives  we use derivative instruments  primarily interest rate and commodity swap agreements  to manage risk exposures when appropriate  based on market conditions 
we do not enter into derivative agreements for trading or other speculative purposes  nor are we a party to any leveraged derivative instrument 
the interest rate swap and commodity swap agreements are designated as cash flow hedges and are reflected at fair value in our consolidated balance sheet and the related gains or losses on these contracts are deferred in stockholders equity as a component of other comprehensive income 
deferred gains and losses are amortized as an adjustment to expense over the same period in which the related items being hedged are recognized in income 
however  to the extent that any of these contracts are not considered to be perfectly effective in offsetting the change in the value of the items being hedged  any changes in fair value relating to the ineffective portion of these contracts are immediately recognized in income 

table of contents interest rate swap agreements are entered into for periods consistent with related underlying exposures and do not constitute positions independent of those exposures 
at december   we had seven outstanding interest rate swap agreements which commence and expire as follows notional effective date termination date fixed rate in thousands the interest rate swap agreements described above had notional amounts totaling million  which amounts are used to calculate the contractual cash flows to be exchanged under the contract

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that may not be readily apparent from other sources 
senior management has discussed the 
table of contents development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and with our independent auditors 
an accounting policy is considered critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact our financial statements 
we consider the following accounting policies to be critical and could result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions customer exposure and credit risk allowance for doubtful accounts methodology 
we evaluate the collectability of our accounts and notes receivable based on a combination of factors 
in most circumstances when we become aware of factors that may indicate a deterioration in a specific customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us eg  reductions of product purchases  deteriorating store conditions  changes in payment patterns  we record a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
in determining the adequacy of the reserves  we analyze factors such as the value of any collateral  customer financial statements  historical collection experience  aging of receivables and other economic and industry factors 
it is possible that the accuracy of the estimation process could be materially affected by different judgments as to the collectability based on information considered and further deterioration of accounts 
if circumstances change ie  further evidence of material adverse creditworthiness  additional accounts become credit risks  store closures  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due us could be reduced by a material amount  including to zero 
refer to part ii  item of this report under note accounts and notes receivable of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of these allowances 
lease commitments 
we have historically leased store sites for sublease to qualified independent retailers at rates that are at least as high as the rent paid by us 
under terms of the original lease agreements  we remain primarily liable for any commitments an independent retailer may no longer be financially able to satisfy 
we also lease store sites for our retail segment 
should a retailer be unable to perform under a sublease or should we close underperforming corporate stores  we record a charge to earnings for costs of the remaining term of the lease  less any anticipated sublease income 
calculating the estimated losses requires that significant estimates and judgments be made by management 
our reserves for such properties can be materially affected by factors such as the extent of interested sub lessees and their creditworthiness  our ability to negotiate early termination agreements with lessors  general economic conditions and the demand for commercial property 
should the number of defaults by sub lessees or corporate store closures materially increase  the remaining lease commitments we must record could have a material adverse effect on operating results and cash flows 
refer to part ii  item of this report under note leases of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of lease commitments 
guarantees of debt and lease obligations of others 
we have guaranteed the debt and lease obligations of certain of our food distribution customers 
in the event these retailers are unable to meet their debt service payments or otherwise experience an event of default  we would be unconditionally liable for the outstanding balance of their debt and lease obligations million as of december   which would be due in accordance with the underlying agreements 
all of the guarantees were issued prior to december  and therefore were not subject to the recognition and measurement provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  an interpretation of fasb statements no 
 and and a rescission of fasb interpretation no 
fin 
we have also assigned various leases to certain food distribution customers and other third parties 
if the assignees were to become unable to continue making payments under the assigned leases  we estimate our maximum potential obligation with respect to the assigned leases to be approximately million as of december  in circumstances when we become aware of factors that indicate deterioration in a customer s ability to meet its financial obligations guaranteed or assigned by us  we record a specific reserve in the amount we reasonably believe we will be obligated to pay on the 
table of contents customer s behalf  net of any anticipated recoveries from the customer 
in determining the adequacy of these reserves  we analyze factors such as those described above in allowance for doubtful accounts methodology and lease commitments 
it is possible that the accuracy of the estimation process could be materially affected by different judgments as to the obligations based on information considered and further deterioration of accounts  with the potential for a corresponding adverse effect on operating results and cash flows 
triggering these guarantees or obligations under assigned leases would not  however  result in cross default of our debt  but could restrict resources available for general business initiatives 
refer to part ii  item of this report under note concentration of credit risk for more information regarding customer exposure and credit risk 
impairment of long lived assets property  plant and equipment are tested for impairment in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such long lived assets may not be recoverable from future net pretax cash flows 
impairment testing requires significant management judgment including estimating future sales and costs  alternative uses for the assets and estimated proceeds from disposal of the assets 
estimates of future results are often influenced by assessments of changes in competition  merchandising strategies  human resources and general market conditions  which may result in not recognizing an impairment loss 
impairment testing is conducted at the lowest level where cash flows can be measured and are independent of cash flows of other assets 
an asset impairment would be indicated if the sum of the expected future net pretax cash flows from the use of the asset undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the asset 
an impairment loss would be measured based on the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying amount 
we generally determine fair value by discounting expected future cash flows at the rate the company utilizes to evaluate potential investments 
the estimates and assumptions used in the impairment analysis are consistent with the business plans and estimates we use to manage our business operations and to make acquisition and divestiture decisions 
the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease the impairment charge 
actual outcomes may differ from the estimates 
it is possible that the accuracy of the estimation of future results could be materially affected by different judgments as to competition  strategies and market conditions  with the potential for a corresponding adverse effect on financial condition and operating results 
goodwill goodwill for each of the company s reporting units is tested for impairment in accordance with sfas goodwill and other intangible assets annually and or when factors indicating impairment are present 
fair value is determined primarily based on valuation studies performed by the company  which utilize a discounted cash flow methodology 
valuation analysis requires significant judgments and estimates to be made by management 
the company s estimates could be materially impacted by factors such as competitive forces  customer behaviors  changes in growth trends and specific industry conditions  with the potential for a corresponding adverse effect on financial condition and operating results and impairment of the goodwill 
income taxes when preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax obligations based on expected income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
in the event there is a significant unusual or one time item recognized in our results of operations  the tax attributable to that item would be separately calculated and recorded in the period the unusual or one time item occurred 
tax law requires certain items to be included in our tax return at different times than the items are reflected in our results of operations 
as a result  the income tax expense reflected in our statements of income is different than that shown on our tax returns 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses that 
table of contents are not deductible in our tax returns  and some differences will reverse over time  such as depreciation expense on property  plant and equipment 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheets 
deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax returns in future years but have already been recorded as an expense in our statements of income 
we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent we believe that recovery is unlikely  we must establish a valuation reserve against those deferred tax assets 
deferred tax liabilities generally represent items for which we have already taken a deduction in our tax returns but we have not recognized the items as an expense in our statements of income 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions  and in determining our income tax expense  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we establish reserves for income tax contingencies when  despite our belief that the tax return positions are fully supportable  certain positions are likely to be challenged and we may ultimately not prevail in defending those positions 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit 
our effective tax rate includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate  as well as related interest and penalties 
these reserves relate to various tax years subject to audit by taxing authorities 
we believe that our current reserves are adequate  and reflect the most probable outcome of known tax contingencies 
however  the ultimate outcome may differ from our estimates and assumptions and could impact the income tax expense reflected in our consolidated statements of income reserves for self insurance we are primarily self insured for workers compensation  general and automobile liability and health insurance costs 
it is our policy to record our self insurance liabilities based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported 
worker s compensation  general and automobile liabilities are actuarially determined on a discounted basis 
we have purchased stop loss coverage to limit our exposure to any significant exposure on a per claim basis 
any projection of losses concerning workers compensation  general and automobile and health insurance liability is subject to a considerable degree of variability 
among the causes of this variability are unpredictable external factors affecting future inflation rates  litigation trends  legal interpretations  benefit level changes and claim settlement patterns 
although our estimates of liabilities incurred do not anticipate significant changes in historical trends for these variables  such changes could have a material impact on future claim costs and currently recorded liabilities 
vendor allowances and credits as is common in our industry  we use a third party service to undertake accounts payable audits on an ongoing basis 
these audits examine vendor allowances offered to us during a given year as well as cash discounts  freight allowances and duplicate payments and establish a basis for us to recover overpayments made to vendors 
we reduce future payments to vendors based on the results of these audits  at which time we also establish reserves for commissions payable to the third party service provider as well as for amounts that may not be collected 
we also establish reserves for future repayments to vendors for disputed payment deductions related to accounts payable audits  promotional allowances and other items 
although our estimates of reserves do not anticipate changes in our historical payback rates  such changes could have a material impact on our currently recorded reserves 
new accounting standards in december  the fasb issued statement no 
revised  share based payment 
the revisions to sfas no require compensation costs related to share based payment transactions to be recognized in the financial statements 
with limited exceptions  the amount of compensation cost will be measured based on the grant date fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
in addition  liability awards will be re measured each reporting period 
compensation cost will be recognized over the period that an employee provides service in exchange for the award
