application of critical accounting policies in preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles  management is required to make certain estimates  judgments  and assumptions 
these estimates  judgments  and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
the significant accounting policies which management and the audit committee believe are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate the company s financial position and results of operations include the following 
the discussion below applies to each of the company s reportable segments physician business  elder care business  and corporate shared services  unless otherwise noted 

table of contents revenue recognition physician business 
the physician business has two primary sources of revenue the sale of consumable products and the sale of equipment 
revenue from the sale of consumable products is recognized when products are shipped or delivered since at that time there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  the price is fixed and determinable  and the collection of the resulting accounts receivable is reasonably assured 
revenue from the sale of single deliverable equipment is generally recognized when the equipment is shipped  unless there are multiple deliverables  in which case revenue is recognized when all obligations to the customer are fulfilled 
obligations to the customer are typically satisfied when installation and training are complete 
customers have the right to return consumable products and equipment 
sales allowances are recorded as a reduction of revenue for potential product returns and estimated billing errors 
management analyzes sales allowances quarterly using historical data adjusted for significant changes in volume and business conditions  as well as specific identification of significant returns or billing errors 
elder care business 
the elder care business has four primary sources of revenue the sale of consumable products to skilled nursing home facilities  assisted living facilities  and home care providers  the sale of consumable products to medicare eligible customers  the sale of equipment  and service fees earned for providing medicare part b billing services 
revenue from the sale of consumable products to skilled nursing home facilities  assisted living facilities  and home care providers is recognized when products are shipped or delivered 
revenue for these products is recorded at shipment since at that time there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  the price is fixed and determinable  and the collection of the resulting accounts receivable is reasonably assured 
revenue from providing medicare part b billing services on a full assignment basis is recognized during the period the supplies being provided to medicare eligible patients are consumed and medicare is billed 
revenue is recorded at the amounts expected to be collected from medicare  other third party payors  and directly from customers 
revenue for medicare reimbursement is recorded based on government determined reimbursement prices for medicare covered items 
medicare reimburses of the government determined reimbursement prices for reimbursable supplies and the remaining balance is billed to either third party payors or directly to customers 
reimbursement from medicare is subject to review by appropriate government regulators 
revenue from providing medicare part b billing services on a fee for service basis is recognized when billing services are rendered to the customer 
revenue from the sale of single deliverable equipment is generally recognized when the equipment is shipped  unless there are multiple deliverables  in which case revenue is recognized when all obligations to the customer are fulfilled 
customers have the right to return consumable products and equipment 
sales allowances are recorded as a reduction of revenue for i potential product and equipment returns  ii revenue adjustments related to actual usage of products by eligible medicare part b patients  and iii medicare part b reimbursement denials  and billing errors 
management analyzes product returns quarterly using historical data adjusted for significant changes in volume and business conditions  as well as specific identification of significant returns 
management analyzes billing errors on at least a semi annual basis using historical data or a sampling methodology as well as specific identification of significant billing errors 
management analyzes revenue adjustments related to estimated usage of products by eligible medicare part b patients and medicare part b reimbursement denials using historical actual cash collection and actual adjustments to gross revenue for a certain period of time 
additional allowances are recorded for any significant specific adjustments known to management 
consolidated sales allowances are immaterial and generally represent less than of gross sales 

table of contents estimating allowances for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability to collect outstanding amounts due from its customers 
the allowances include specific amounts for those accounts that are likely to be uncollectible  such as bankruptcies  and general allowances for those accounts that management currently believes to be collectible but later become uncollectible 
estimates are used to determine the allowances for doubtful accounts and are based on historical collection experience  current economic trends  credit worthiness of customers  changes in customer payment terms  and percentages applied to the accounts receivable aging categories 
the percentage of each aging category that is reserved is determined by analyzing historical write offs and current trends in the credit quality of the customer base 
management performs ongoing credit evaluations by reviewing the customer s current financial information 
a credit review is performed on new customers in the physician business and an annual credit review is performed on all major customers in the elder care business 
at a minimum  each elder care customer account is reviewed annually 
adjustments to credit limits and allowances for bad debts are made based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate or improve  allowances may be adjusted which will impact general and administrative expenses and accounts receivable 
inventory valuation inventories  which primarily consist of medical products and supplies and diagnostic equipment  are valued at the lower of cost or market  on a first in  first out basis 
as part of this valuation process  excess and slow moving inventories are reduced to estimated net realizable value 
the company s accounting for excess and slow moving inventory contains uncertainty because management must use judgment to estimate when the inventory will be sold and the quantities and prices at which the inventory will be sold in the normal course of business 
when preparing these estimates  management considers and reviews historical results  inventory quantities on hand  current operating trends  sales forecasts  and slow movement reports 
these estimates can be affected by a number of factors  including general economic conditions  supply interruptions by a manufacturer  and other factors affecting demand for the company s inventory 
any adjustments to the valuation of inventory will impact cost of goods sold and inventory 
estimating accruals for vendor rebates the company receives transaction based and performance based rebates from third party vendors 
such rebates are classified as either i a reduction to cost of goods sold  ii a reduction of the cost incurred  or iii an increase to net sales in the accompanying statements of operations 
transaction based rebates are generally associated with a specific customer contract and are recognized as a reduction to cost of goods sold at the time the transaction occurs 
performance based rebates are typically measured against inventory purchases from the manufacturer or sales volume levels and are received from the vendors at the time certain performance measures are achieved 
performance based rebates are recognized based on a systematic and rational allocation of the consideration to be received relative to the transaction that marks the progress of the company toward earning the rebate or refund  provided the amounts are probable and reasonably estimatable 
therefore  management uses judgment and estimates to determine the amount of performance based rebates to recognize each period 
if the amounts are not probable and reasonably estimable  rebate income is recognized upon achieving the performance measure 
vendor rebates are recognized in income only if the related inventory has been sold 
therefore  management estimates the amount of vendor rebate income related to inventory not sold and establishes a reserve on a quarterly basis 
if the facts and circumstances used by management to assess whether the performance targets will be achieved by the company or the amount of inventory that has been sold change  the company s financial condition and the results of operations could materially change period to period 

table of contents estimating valuation allowances for deferred tax assets the liability method is used for determining income taxes  under which current and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded in accordance with enacted tax laws and rates 
under this method  the amounts of deferred tax assets and liabilities at the end of each period are determined using the tax rate expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered 
valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in determining the need for valuation allowances  management considers and makes judgments and estimates regarding estimated future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
these estimates and judgments include some degree of uncertainty and changes in these estimates and assumptions could require management to adjust the valuation allowances for deferred tax assets 
the ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets generally depends on the generation of sufficient taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions 
the company s tax filings are subjected to audit by the internal revenue service irs 
these audits may result in assessments of additional taxes that are resolved with the authorities or potentially through the courts 
management believes that these assessments may occasionally be based on erroneous and even arbitrary interpretations of tax law 
resolution of these situations inevitably includes some degree of uncertainty  accordingly  the company provides taxes only for the amounts management believes will ultimately result from these proceedings 
management does not believe it is possible to reasonably estimate the potential impact of changes to the assumptions and estimates identified because the resulting change to the tax liability  if any  is dependent on numerous factors which cannot be reasonably estimated 
these include  among others  i the amount and nature of additional taxes potentially asserted by federal  state  and local tax authorities  ii the willingness of federal  state  and local tax authorities to negotiate a fair settlement through an administrative process  and iii the impartiality of the federal  state  and local courts 
management s experience has been that the estimates and assumptions used to provide for future tax assessments have proven to be appropriate 
however  past experience is only a guide  and the potential exists  however limited  that the tax resulting from the resolution of current and potential future tax controversies may differ materially from the amount accrued 
during the three months ended december   the provision for income taxes was reduced approximately million as a result of a settlement agreement between the company and the appeals office of the irs 
refer to note  income taxes  for a further discussion 
the settlement agreement was subject to final review and approval by the congressional joint committee on taxation the joint committee 
in october  the company received written notification that the joint committee has found no exception to the settlement agreement reached with the appeals office of the irs 
the company s results of operations during fiscal year were not materially impacted as a result of the written notification from the joint committee 
estimating useful lives of property and equipment property and equipment is recorded at cost and is depreciated on a straight line basis over the following estimated useful lives 
useful life equipment to years capitalized internal use software costs to years computer hardware and software to years leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful lives 
management is required to use judgment in determining the estimated useful lives of such assets 
changes in circumstances such as technological advances  changes to the company s business model  changes in the company s business strategy  or changes in the planned use of property and equipment could result in the actual useful lives differing from the company s current estimates 
in those cases where the company determines that 
table of contents the useful life of property and equipment should be shortened or extended  the company would depreciate the net book value in excess of the estimated salvage value over its revised remaining useful life 
during fiscal years  and  the company adjusted the useful lives of certain assets in accordance with apb the estimated useful lives of certain computer hardware and software with a carrying value of approximately million were extended months on march  to coincide with the expected service life of the assets 
computer hardware and software capitalized subsequent to this change in estimate is being depreciated over a period ranging from to years 
this change in estimate resulted in a decrease in depreciation expense of approximately million  net of tax  or approximately diluted earnings per share  for the fiscal year ended march  during fiscal years and  the impact to depreciation expense as a result of adjusting the useful lives of certain assets was immaterial 
legal contingencies the company is party to various legal and administrative proceedings and claims arising in the normal course of business 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  if it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss is estimatable  an accrual for the costs to resolve these claims is recorded in accrued expenses in the accompanying balance sheets 
professional fees related to these claims are included in general and administrative expenses in the accompanying statements of operations 
management  with the assistance of outside counsel  determines whether it is probable that a liability has been incurred and whether the amount of potential loss is estimatable 
the determination is based upon potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
management does not believe the outstanding legal proceedings at march   will have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular period could be materially affected by changes in management s assumptions related to the anticipated or actual outcome of the outstanding legal proceedings 
during fiscal year  the company settled a class action lawsuit pursuant to which the company was required to pay million  of which approximately million was accrued for during fiscal year  to cover the uninsured losses and professional fees to resolve all claims 
during fiscal year  the company settled a lawsuit pursuant to which the company was required to pay approximately million to resolve all claims 
in addition  the company settled a lawsuit pursuant to which the opposing parties agreed to pay the company million to resolve all claims and counterclaims 
impairment of goodwill  intangibles  and other long lived assets sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas requires goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets to be tested for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may be impaired 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at each reporting unit annually on the last day of each fiscal year  which is the friday closest to march in accordance with sfas  management has identified the following reporting units the physician business  southern anesthesia surgical  inc  the elder care business  proclaim  inc  and tiger specialty sourcing limited and tiger shanghai specialty sourcing co 
ltd 
collectively tiger medical 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets were not impaired during fiscal years   and the impairment and disposal of long lived assets is accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  sfas 
sfas requires that long lived assets  such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization  be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
certain factors which may occur and indicate that an impairment exists include  but are not limited 
table of contents to i significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  ii significant changes in the manner of the company s use of the underlying assets  and iii significant adverse industry or market economic trends 
nonsolicitation payments made to certain sales representatives will also be tested annually or more frequently for impairment in accordance with sfas certain factors which may occur and indicate that an impairment of the nonsolicitation agreements exists include  but are not limited to i a change in a state s legal system that would impact any legal opinion relied upon when assessing enforceability of the nonsolicitation covenants  ii a decline in gross profit generated by a sales representative below the amount that the nonsolicitation was based upon  iii death  or iv full retirement by the sales representative 
in the event that the carrying value of assets are determined to be unrecoverable  the company would estimate the fair value of the assets or reporting unit and record an impairment charge for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value 
management must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows  revenues  earnings  and other factors to determine the fair value of these respective assets 
if these estimates or related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record an impairment charge 
impairment charges would be included in general and administrative expenses in the accompanying statements of operations  and would result in reduced carrying amounts of the related assets in the accompanying balance sheets 
an immaterial impairment charge related to nonsolicitation agreements was recorded during the fiscal year ended march  excluding this immaterial charge  management does not believe there were any circumstances which indicated that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable during fiscal year business combinations the company allocates the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values 
the company obtains valuations from an independent third party to assist in determining the fair values of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable 
these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies 
critical estimates in valuing acquired intangible assets include  but are not limited to i expected future cash flows from existing customer contracts and relationships  ii assumptions relating to the impact of noncompete agreements on business operations  iii assumptions related to the impact on the timing of expected future cash flows  iv retention of customers and key business leaders  and v the risk inherent in investing in intangible assets 
these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumption  estimates  or other actual results

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the company s objective in managing market risk exposures is to identify and limit the potential impact of changes in interest rates  commodity availability  and access of capital on earnings and cash flow 
the following assessment of the company s market risk does not include uncertainties that are either nonfinancial or nonquantifiable  such as political uncertainty  economic uncertainty  impact of future tax legislation  and credit risks 
interest rate risk 
the company s primary interest rate exposure relates to cash and cash equivalents and fixed and variable rate debt 
during fiscal year  the company s debt obligations consisted of i million convertible senior notes with a fixed rate of and ii variable rate borrowings under the revolving line of credit  which bear interest at the bank s prime rate plus an applicable margin based on availability of borrowings  or at libor plus an applicable margin based on availability of borrowings 
availability of borrowings depends upon a borrowing base calculation consisting of accounts receivable and inventory  subject to satisfaction of certain eligibility requirements less any outstanding letters of credit 
changes in interest rates affect interest payments under the company s variable rate revolving line of credit agreement 
during fiscal years   and  the company maintained an interest rate swap agreement that matured on march   with a notional amount during the period that covered a portion of variable rate borrowings and which effectively fixed the notional amount covered by the swap at a borrowing rate of plus a credit spread 
at march   there were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving line of credit and the interest rate swap agreement had matured 
as of the beginning of fiscal year  additional borrowings 
table of contents under the revolving line of credit will incur interest at a variable rate 
a hypothetical increase in interest rates of basis points would result in potential reduction of future pre tax earnings of approximately million per year for every million outstanding under the revolving line of credit 
changes in interest rates also affect rates of return on the company s cash equivalents and short term investments  which generally consist of money market accounts 
a hypothetical decrease in interest rates of basis points would result in a potential reduction in future pre tax earnings of approximately million per year for every million of short term investments 
due to the short term nature of the company s investments  typically less than day maturities  the impact of a similar basis point change in interest rates would have an immaterial impact on the carrying value of an investment 
currency risk 
the company s currency rate exposures relate to products that are globally sourced from manufacturers primarily in southeast asia 
currently  the company has negotiated settlement of payments to manufacturers in us dollars 
however  over time  local country currency fluctuations may increase or decrease the negotiated cost that the company must pay for these products 
in addition  the company may in future periods negotiate settlement of payments to manufacturers in the local currency of the country providing a product which would then subject the company to foreign currency risk 
based on current global purchases  a hypothetical change in the currency exchange rates would not have a material impact on the company s consolidated results of operations 
commodity risk 
the company s primary commodity exposures relate to fluctuations in the price of gasoline and diesel fuel and the procurement of certain medical supplies in which the product cost is dependent upon the price of raw materials  primarily latex and vinyl 
the company s direct fuel exposure relates to fluctuations in fuel costs that affect the company leased delivery fleet or third party carrier delivery charges 
significant increases in the cost of gasoline and diesel fuel have impacted  and will continue to impact  the company s gross margin and cost to deliver and the operating costs of common carriers 
some of these common carriers have passed these increases through to the company in the form of a fuel surcharge  which has had an adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the company implemented a fuel surcharge during fiscal year to offset a portion of the increased cost of gasoline and diesel fuel 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to fully pass along any further significant increases in fuel costs to its customers due to the competitive nature of the medical supply distribution industry 
beginning in fiscal year  the company implemented a derivative program to assist in managing exposures to fuel costs that impact its delivery fleet 
the company purchases latex and vinyl gloves in which the pricing of the gloves is based on the price of raw wet latex as traded on the malaysian rubber exchange and the weighted price of two raw materials  poly vinyl chloride pvc and dioctylphthalate dop  as published on www 
icis 
com 
a hypothetical change in the price of these raw materials would not be material to the company s consolidated results of operations 
the company currently does not have derivative instruments in place with respect to the increased cost of these raw materials
