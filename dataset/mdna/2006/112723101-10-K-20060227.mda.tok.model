overview we design  construct and market single family and multi family homes primarily to move up and luxury homebuyers and develop land for sale to other homebuilders 
our operations are currently focused primarily in five regional markets san francisco bay area  southland los angeles  san diego riverside  sacramento  and the washington dc area 
our goal is to maximize the total return on our common stockholders equity over the long term 
we plan to achieve this by actively managing our assets and creating value on the lots we own or control 
the  lots that we control   of which we own directly or through joint ventures  provide a strong foundation for our future homebuilding business and visibility on our future cash flow and earnings 
the lots we own directly or through joint ventures represent approximately a seven year lot supply  based on our planned home closings of  homebuilding is our primary source of revenue and has represented over of our total revenue since our operations are positioned to close annually between  and  homes 
operating in markets with higher price points and catering to move up and luxury buyers  our average sales price in of  was well in excess of the national average sales price 
we also sell serviced and unserviced lots to other homebuilders generally on an opportunistic basis where we can redeploy capital to an asset providing higher returns or reduce risk  in a market 
in  we sold  lots  the majority of which were bulk sales of raw or undeveloped land in san diego and the washington dc area 
in addition to our housing and land inventory and investments in housing and land joint ventures  which together comprised of our total assets as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million in other assets 
other assets consist of homebuyer receivables of million  deferred income taxes of million  and mortgages and other receivables of million 
homebuyer receivables consist primarily of proceeds due from homebuyers on the closing of homes 
since  our revenues and net income have grown at compounded annual growth rates of and  respectively 
over the same period  we generated over million in operating cash flow that was used mainly to return cash to stockholders 
at the same time  we believe we have positioned our business for future growth through the selective optioning or acquisition of a significant number of large projects and the level of lots controlled 
our recent growth is primarily the result of strong economic fundamentals in the markets in which we operate and our success in acquiring strategic parcels of land

in addition  sales absorptions assisted us in controlling sales and marketing costs 
sales activity net new orders were  units in  an increase of units over the increase was primarily a result of continued strong market conditions in all our markets and a number of successful new project openings in san diego offset by a delay in new project openings in the washington dc area 
our backlog of sales at december  was units compared to units last year 
the decrease in backlog is primarily a result of fewer homes available for sale within communities nearing build out in the san francisco bay area and southland los angeles 
liquidity and capital resources financial position our total assets as of december  were  million  compared to  million as of december   an increase of million 
the increase in was a result of increases in housing and land inventory of million  receivables and other assets of million  cash and cash equivalents of million  deferred income taxes of million  partially offset by decreases of million in consolidated land inventory not owned and million in investments in housing and land joint ventures 
the increase in housing and land assets is primarily a result of the acquisition of over  lots previously held under option for million and ongoing construction and development of homes in backlog 
our total debt as of december  was million  an increase of million over december  total debt as of december  consisted primarily of project specific financings of million  which represent construction and development loans that are repaid from home and lot sales proceeds 
as new homes are constructed  further loan facilities are arranged on a rolling basis 
our major project specific lenders are bank of america  housing capital corporation  union bank of california and wells fargo 
other debt includes deferred compensation of million on which interest is paid at the prime rate  and loans outstanding relating to mortgages we originated totaling million  which are repaid when the underlying mortgages are sold to permanent lenders 
as of december   the average interest rate on our debt was  with maturities as follows maturities post millions total san francisco bay area southland los angeles san diego riverside washington dc area other total cash flow our principal uses of working capital include purchases of land  land development and home construction 
cash flows for each of our communities depend upon the applicable stage of the development cycle and can differ substantially from reported earnings 
early stages of development require significant cash outlays for land acquisitions  site approvals and entitlements  construction of model homes  roads  certain utilities and other amenities and general landscaping 
because these costs are capitalized  income reported for financial statement purposes during such early stages may significantly exceed cash flow 
later  cash flow can significantly exceed earnings reported for financial statement purposes  as cost of sales includes charges for substantial amounts of previously expended costs 
a summary of our lots owned and their stage of development at december  compared with the same period last year follows housing units and model homes lots ready for house construction graded lots and lots commenced grading undeveloped land cash provided by our operating activities totaled million for the year ended december   compared with million in the decrease in cash generated was primarily the result of the acquisition of lots previously held under option partially offset by increased net income 
cash used in our investing activities in joint ventures for the year ended december  was million  compared with cash provided of million in the increase in cash used was primarily a result of contributions of capital in our joint ventures in san diego 
cash used in our financing activities for the year ended december  was million  compared with million in our use of cash in related primarily to share repurchases of million offset by increased borrowings 
deferred tax our company was formed in the course of a reorganization in by brookfield properties of its united states homebuilding operations and was withdrawn from the brookfield properties consolidated tax group 
the tax provisions that apply in connection with the reorganization  including the departure of a member from a consolidated group  are detailed and complex and are therefore subject to uncertainty 
our accounts payable and other liabilities include million related to the uncertainties in tax attributes which were recorded when we left the brookfield properties consolidated tax group with million of net operating losses 
for example  if the brookfield properties consolidated group of companies was reassessed for taxation years prior to  this would have a direct impact on the net operating losses available to the company on the spin off 
there is also a million liability included in accounts payable and other liabilities and a million valuation allowance in deferred taxes that relates to the tax cost of properties in excess of the fair value of properties at the time of reorganization of the company which may not be realized 
the exact amount of these tax liabilities will be determined at the earlier of a review of the spin off transaction by taxation authorities or a further liability of million has been recorded in respect of tax positions taken 
we believe we have been prudent and reasonable to provide for any reduction in our net operating losses or loss of tax basis in properties 
contractual obligations and other commitments we generally fund the development of our communities through the use of project specific financings 
as of december   we had available project specific debt lines of million that were available to complete land development and construction activities 
as of december   we also had available cash and cash equivalents of million 
a total of million of our project specific and other financings mature prior to the end of our high level of debt maturities in and are a result of our expected project completions over this period 
although the level of our maturing debt is high  we expect to generate cash flow from our assets in and to repay these obligations 
our net debt to total capitalization ratio as of december   which is defined as total interest bearing debt less cash divided by total interest bearing debt less cash plus stockholders equity and minority interest  was  an increase from as of december  for a description of the specific risks facing us if  for any reason  we are unable to meet these obligations  refer to the section of this form k entitled item a risk factors our debt and leverage could adversely affect our financial condition 
in connection with our project specific financings  brookfield homes holdings inc  a wholly owed subsidiary  is required to maintain a tangible net worth of at least million 
in addition  our project specific financings require brookfield homes holdings inc to maintain a net debt to capitalization ratio of no greater than and a debt to tangible net worth ratio of no greater than to a summary of our contractual obligations as of december  follows payment due by period less than more than total year years years years project specific and other financings a operating lease obligations b purchase obligations c total d a amounts are included on the consolidated balance sheet 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k for additional information regarding project specific and other financings and related matters 
b amounts relate to multiple non cancelable operating leases involving office space  design centers and model homes 
c amounts are included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
see note for additional information regarding purchase obligations and related matters 
d amounts do not include interest due to the floating nature of our debt 
off balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business  we use lot option contracts and joint ventures to acquire control of land to mitigate the risk of declining land values 
option contracts for the purchase of land permit us to control the land for an extended period of time  until options expire and or we are ready to develop the land to construct homes or sell the land 
this reduces our financial risk associated with land holdings 
as of december   we had million of primarily non refundable option deposits and advanced costs 
the total exercise price of these options was million 
pursuant to fin r  as defined elsewhere in this form k  we have consolidated million of these option contracts 
please see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k for additional information on our lot options 
we also control  lots through joint ventures 
as of december   our investment in housing and land joint ventures was million 
we have provided varying levels of guarantees of debt in our joint ventures 
as of december   we had recourse guarantees of million and limited maintenance guarantees of million with respect to debt in our joint ventures 
we obtain letters of credit  performance bonds and other bonds to support our obligations with respect to the development of our projects 
the amount of these obligations outstanding at any time varies in accordance with our development activities 
if these letters of credit or bonds are drawn upon  we will be obligated to reimburse the issuer of the letter of credit or bonds 
as of december   we had million in letters of credit outstanding and million in performance bonds for these purposes 
we do not believe that any of these letters of credit or bonds are likely to be drawn upon 
stock repurchase program in february  our board of directors approved a share repurchase program which allowed us to repurchase up to million of our outstanding common shares 
in february and december  our board of directors approved and publicly announced increases of million and million  respectively  in the share repurchase program 
during the year ended december   we had repurchased  of our shares under the program at an average cost of per share

at december   the remaining amount approved for repurchases is million 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements of our company  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make assumptions  estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our most critical accounting policies are those that we believe are the most important in portraying our financial condition and results of operations  and require the most subjectivity and estimates by our management 
a summary of our significant accounting policies  including the critical accounting policies discussed below  is provided in the notes to the consolidated financial statements of our company included elsewhere in this form k 
capitalized costs our housing and land inventory on our consolidated balance sheet includes the costs of acquiring land  development and construction costs  interest  property taxes and overhead directly related to the development of the land and housing 
direct costs are capitalized to individual homes and lots and other costs are allocated to each lot in proportion to our anticipated revenue 
estimates of costs to complete homes and lots sold are recorded at the time of closing 
these estimates are prepared on an individual home and lot basis and take into account the specific cost components of each individual home and lot 
the estimation process to allocate costs to homes and lots is dependent on project budgets that are based on various assumptions  including construction schedules and future costs to be incurred 
these estimates are reviewed for accuracy based on actual payments made after closing and adjustments are made if necessary 
if the estimates of costs are significantly different from our actual results  our housing and land inventory may be over or under stated on our balance sheet  and accordingly gross margins in a particular period may be over or under stated 
carrying values housing and land assets are reviewed for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
to arrive at this amount  we estimate the cash flow for the life of each project 
these projections take into account the specific business plans for each project  and our estimate of the most probable set of economic conditions anticipated to prevail in the market area 
if these assets are considered to be impaired  they are then written down to the fair value less estimated selling costs 
the ultimate fair values for our housing and land inventory are dependent upon future market and economic conditions 
if our estimate of the future cash flows is significantly different from our actual cash flows  we may prematurely impair the value of the asset  we may underestimate the value of the calculated impairment or we may fail to record an impairment 
in these cases  our housing and land inventory would be represented on our balance sheet at other than its cost or fair value  which could have an effect on our gross margin in future periods as we develop and sell the assets 
revenue recognition revenues from the sale of homes are recognized when title passes to the purchaser upon closing  wherein all proceeds are received or collectability is evident 
land sales are recognized when title passes to the purchaser upon closing  all material conditions of the sales contract have been met and a significant cash down payment or appropriate security is received  and collectability is evident 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting changes and error corrections  which replaces accounting principles board apb opinion  accounting changes and sfas  reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
sfas requires retrospective application of changes in accounting principles to prior periods financial statements unless it is impracticable to determine the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
this statement is effective in fiscal years beginning after december  in december  the fasb issued sfas r  share based payment 
sfas r establishes accounting standards for transactions in which a company exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services 
in particular  this statement requires companies to record compensation expense for all share based payments  such as employee stock options  at fair market value 
this statement is effective for the first quarter of the first fiscal year that begins after june  the company s first fiscal quarter beginning january  
we have evaluated the impact of the adoption of sfas r and have determined that it will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued staff position  application of fasb statement  accounting for income taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of fsp 
the american jobs creation act  which was signed into law in october  provides a tax deduction on qualified domestic production activities 
when fully phased in  the deduction will be up to of the lesser of qualified production activities income or taxable income 
based on the guidance provided by fsp  this deduction should be accounted for as a special deduction under sfas and will reduce tax expense in the period or periods that the amounts are deductible on the tax return 
the tax benefit resulting from the new deduction was effective for fiscal the impact of this law on our consolidated financial statements was a reduction in our current income tax expense of million 
seasonality and quarterly information we have historically experienced variability in results of operations from quarter to quarter due to the seasonal nature of the homebuilding business and the timing of new community openings and the closing out of projects 
we typically experience the highest rate of orders for new homes in the first six months of the calendar year 
new home deliveries trail new home orders by several months  therefore we normally have a greater percentage of new home deliveries in the second half of our fiscal year 
as a result  our revenues from deliveries of homes are generally higher in the second half of the year 
the following table presents a summary of our operating results for each of the last eight quarters december september june march millions  except home closings and per share amounts total revenue gross margin contribution from bulk land sales to net income net income diluted earnings per share home closings units total assets total debt quarterly and year to date computations of per share amounts are made independently 
therefore  the sum of per share amounts for the quarters may not agree with per share amounts for the year

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk exchange rates we conduct business in us dollars only  so we are not exposed to currency risks 
interest rates we are exposed to financial risks that arise from the fluctuations in interest rates 
our interest bearing assets and liabilities are mainly at floating rates  so we would be negatively affected  on balance  if interest rates increase 
in addition  we have an interest rate swap contract which effectively fixes million of our variable rate debt at and an interest rate swap contract which effectively fixes million of our variable interest rate debt at 
based on our debt levels as of december   a change up or down in interest rates would have either a negative or positive effect of approximately million on our cash flows 
our interest rate swaps are not designated as hedges under sfas we are exposed to market share risk associated with changes in the fair values of the swaps  and such changes must be reflected in our income statements 
as of december   the fair value of the interest rate swaps was million
