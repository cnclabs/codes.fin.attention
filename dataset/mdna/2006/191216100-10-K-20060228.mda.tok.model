our business general we are the largest manufacturer  distributor and marketer of nonalcoholic beverage concentrates and syrups in the world 
we also manufacture  distribute and market some finished beverages 
along with coca cola  which is recognized as the world s most valuable brand  we market four of the world s top five soft drink brands  including diet coke  fanta and sprite 
our company owns or licenses more than brands  including carbonated soft drinks  juice and juice drinks  sports drinks  water products  teas  coffees and other beverages to meet consumers desires  needs and lifestyle choices 
more than billion servings of our products are consumed worldwide each day 
our company generates revenues  income and cash flows by manufacturing and selling beverage concentrates and syrups as well as some finished beverages 
we generally sell these products to bottling and canning operations  fountain wholesalers and some fountain retailers and  in the case of finished products  to distributors 
our bottlers sell our branded products in more than countries on six continents to businesses and institutions including retail chains  supermarkets  restaurants  small neighborhood grocers  sports and entertainment venues  and schools and colleges 
we continue to expand our marketing presence and increase our unit case volume growth in most emerging economies 
our strong and stable system helps us to capture growth by manufacturing  distributing and marketing existing  enhanced and new innovative products to our consumers throughout the world 
we have three types of bottling relationships bottlers in which our company has no ownership interest  bottlers in which our company has a noncontrolling ownership interest and bottlers in which our company has a controlling ownership interest 
we authorize our bottling partners to manufacture and package products made from our concentrates and syrups into branded finished products that they then distribute and sell 
bottling partners in which our company has no ownership interest or a noncontrolling ownership interest produced and distributed approximately percent of our worldwide unit case volume 
we make significant marketing expenditures in support of our brands  including expenditures for advertising  sponsorship fees and special promotional events 
as part of our marketing activities  we  at our discretion  provide retailers and distributors with promotions and point of sale displays  our bottling partners with advertising support and funds designated for the purchase of cold drink equipment  and our consumers with coupons  discounts and promotional incentives 
these marketing expenditures help to enhance awareness of and increase consumer preference for our brands 
we believe that greater awareness and preference promotes long term growth in unit case volume  per capita consumption and our share of worldwide nonalcoholic beverage sales 
the nonalcoholic beverages segment of the commercial beverages industry we operate in the highly competitive nonalcoholic beverages segment of the commercial beverages industry 
we face strong competition from numerous other general and specialty beverage companies 
we  along with other beverage companies  are affected by a number of factors  including  but not limited to  cost to manufacture and distribute products  consumer spending  economic conditions  availability and quality of water  consumer preferences  inflation  political climate  local and national laws and regulations  foreign currency exchange fluctuations  fuel prices and weather patterns 
our objective our objective is to use our formidable assets brands  financial strength  unrivaled distribution system  global reach  and a strong commitment by our management and employees worldwide to achieve long term sustainable growth 
our vision for sustainable growth includes the following people being a great place to work where people are inspired to be the best they can be 
portfolio bringing to the world a portfolio of beverage brands that anticipates and satisfies people s desires and needs 
profit maximizing return to shareowners while being mindful of our overall responsibilities 
partners nurturing a winning network of partners and building mutual loyalty 
planet being a responsible global citizen that makes a difference 
areas of focus revitalizing the organization we are focused on driving accountability throughout the organization  leveraging our internal talent and strengthening the corporate culture 
we realize that our bench strength has been weakened as a result of prior organizational realignments 
therefore  we are investing in building capability by training our existing associates and hiring experienced individuals from outside the company 
we are revising our organizational structure to help improve execution around the world 
we are simplifying and clarifying individual roles and responsibilities 
unleashing our system s potential our goal is to drive efficiency and effectiveness throughout the global coca cola system 
this begins with the alignment of our system around shared goals and performance targets 
we must work in a collaborative manner with our bottling partners throughout the world 
driving enhanced revenue growth across the system is a key focus area for both the company and our bottling partners 
our plans in this area are centered on tailoring strategies to match shopping occasions  offering differentiated packages  building value collaboratively with customers  strengthening in market execution and supporting our family of brands with strong marketing activities 
we are building system capability in this area  sharing learning across the system and capitalizing on immediate consumption opportunities 
focusing on revenue growth is an enabler for the financial health of the coca cola system as a whole 
markets where we effectively implemented a segmented brand  package  price and channel strategy as a system have seen strong results 
at the same time that we are focused on revenue growth  we are also focused on working with our bottling partners to reduce system costs and improve system efficiencies 
together with our bottling partners  we have created a supply chain management company in japan and supported the creation of a bottler owned supply chain organization in north america 
by pooling the resources of bottling partners  we have reduced the costs to manufacture our products 
this type of supply chain initiative is being replicated in china and africa and a number of other markets 
we recognize that our ability to respond to customers needs as a system provides a significant opportunity for future growth 
therefore  we are committed to improving our route to market and our response to customers 
for example  in mexico  we created a joint sales company for noncarbonated beverages 
this sales company is focused on the efficient sale and distribution of noncarbonated beverages to customers that span multiple bottler territories 
executing with excellence globally our business demands excellence in execution 
our business is not overly complicated  but we operate in a dynamic  fast paced environment of global markets and competitive economies 
excellent execution requires discipline  concrete objectives  routines  reporting  follow up  asking hard questions and the desire to take risks 
we must efficiently transfer the knowledge and insights we have gained from successes and failures from one market to other markets around the world 
the nonalcoholic beverages segment of the commercial beverages industry provides opportunities for growth  but it will take a relentless focus on execution to capitalize on those opportunities 
we have identified several specific areas that provide opportunities for growth 
we believe significant growth potential exists in diet and light products  and we intend to make investments to accelerate the growth of such products 
we also believe that the immediate consumption channel offers significant growth potential  and we plan to expand our offerings in this channel 
we must ensure that our family of brands is selectively and profitably expanded to address consumers changing preferences 
in every market  we must focus on the financial health of the entire coca cola system 
we must look for new opportunities with each customer and allocate resources to maximize the impact of these opportunities 
we believe we can capture this growth by focusing on our core brands to maximize the potential of each brand and through additional innovation 
reestablishing our marketing leadership in  we created our new marketing  strategy and innovation group 
we created this distinct group to ensure that these three functional areas are fully aligned and integrated 
carbonated soft drinks remain a fundamental and profitable part of our family of brands  and we believe we should invest in marketing our family of brands more aggressively than we have in the past few years 
in addition  we need to further expand our new products pipeline and continue to develop our innovation capabilities 
accordingly  we increased our marketing and innovation spending in and intend to maintain the increased spending level for the foreseeable future 
challenges and risks operating in more than countries provides unique opportunities for our company 
challenges and risks accompany those opportunities 
looking forward  management has identified certain challenges and risks that demand the attention of the nonalcoholic beverages segment of the commercial beverages industry and our company 
of these  four key challenges and risks are discussed below 
obesity and inactive lifestyles 
increasing awareness among consumers  public health professionals and government agencies of the potential health problems associated with obesity and inactive lifestyles represents a significant challenge to our industry 
we recognize that obesity is a complex public health problem 
our commitment to consumers begins with our broad product line  which includes a wide selection of diet and light beverages  juice and juice drinks  sports drinks and water products 
our commitment also includes adhering to responsible policies in schools and in the marketplace  supporting programs to encourage physical activity and to promote nutrition education  and continuously meeting changing consumer needs through beverage innovation  choice and variety 
we are committed to playing an appropriate role in helping address this issue in cooperation with governments  educators and consumers through science based solutions and programs 
water quality and quantity 
water quality and quantity is an issue that increasingly requires our company s attention and collaboration with the nonalcoholic beverages segment of the commercial beverages industry  governments  nongovernmental organizations and communities where we operate 
water is the main ingredient in substantially all of our products 
it is also a limited natural resource facing unprecedented challenges from overexploitation  increasing pollution and poor management 
our company is in an excellent position to share the water related knowledge we have developed in the communities we serve water resource management  water treatment  wastewater treatment systems  and models for working with communities and partners in addressing water and sanitation needs 
we are actively engaged in assessing the specific water related risks that we and many of our bottling partners face and have implemented a formal water risk management program 
we are working with our global partners to develop water sustainability projects 
we are actively encouraging improved water efficiency and conservation efforts throughout our system 
as demand for water continues to increase around the world  we expect commitment  and continued action on our part will be crucial in the successful long term stewardship of this critical natural resource 
evolving consumer preferences 
consumers want more choices 
we are impacted by shifting consumer demographics and needs  on the go lifestyles  aging populations in developed markets and consumers who are empowered with more information than ever 
we are committed to generating new avenues for growth through our core brands with a focus on diet and light products 
we are also committed to continuing to expand the variety of choices we provide to consumers to meet their needs  desires and lifestyle choices 
increased competition and capabilities in the marketplace 
our company is facing strong competition from some well established global companies and many local players 
we must continue to selectively expand into other profitable segments of the nonalcoholic beverages segment of the commercial beverages industry and re energize our marketing and innovation in order to maintain our brand loyalty and share 
see also item a 
risk factors in part i of this report for additional information about risks and uncertainties facing our company 
all four of these challenges and risks obesity and inactive lifestyles  water quality and quantity  evolving consumer preferences and increased competition and capabilities in the marketplace have the potential to have a material adverse effect on the nonalcoholic beverages segment of the commercial beverages industry and on our company  however  we believe our company is well positioned to appropriately address these challenges and risks 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  which require management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we believe that our most critical accounting policies and estimates relate to the following basis of presentation and consolidation recoverability of noncurrent assets revenue recognition income taxes contingencies management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the company s board of directors 
while our estimates and assumptions are based on our knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future  actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates and assumptions 
for a discussion of the company s significant accounting policies  refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
basis of presentation and consolidation in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
revised december  consolidation of variable interest entities interpretation r 
we adopted interpretation r effective april  refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
our company consolidates all entities that we control by ownership of a majority voting interest as well as variable interest entities for which our company is the primary beneficiary 
our judgment in determining if we are the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entities includes assessing our company s level of involvement in setting up the entity  determining if the activities of the entity are substantially conducted on behalf of our company  determining whether the company provides more than half of the subordinated financial support to the entity  and determining if we absorb the majority of the entity s expected losses or returns 
we use the equity method to account for investments for which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies 
our consolidated net income includes our company s share of the net earnings of these companies 
our judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investment includes considering key factors such as our ownership interest  representation on the board of directors  participation in policy making decisions and material intercompany transactions 
we use the cost method to account for investments in companies that we do not control and for which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies 
in accordance with the cost method  these investments are recorded at cost or fair value  as appropriate 
we record dividend income when applicable dividends are declared 
our company eliminates from financial results all significant intercompany transactions  including the intercompany portion of transactions with equity method investees 
recoverability of noncurrent assets management s assessments of the recoverability of noncurrent assets involve critical accounting estimates 
these assessments reflect management s best assumptions  which  when appropriate  are consistent with the assumptions that we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use 
factors that management must estimate when performing recoverability and impairment tests include  among others  sales volume  prices  inflation  cost of capital  marketing spending  foreign currency exchange rates  tax rates and capital spending 
these factors are often interdependent and therefore do not change in isolation 
these factors include inherent uncertainties  and significant management judgment is involved in estimating their impact 
however  when appropriate  the assumptions we use for financial reporting purposes are consistent with those we use in our internal planning and we believe are consistent with those that a hypothetical marketplace participant would use 
management periodically evaluates and updates the estimates based on the conditions that influence these factors 
the variability of these factors depends on a number of conditions  including uncertainty about future events  and thus our accounting estimates may change from period to period 
if other assumptions and estimates had been used in the current period  the balances for noncurrent assets could have been materially impacted 
furthermore  if management uses different assumptions or if different conditions occur in future periods  future operating results could be materially impacted 
operating in more than countries subjects our company to many uncertainties and risks related to various economic  political and regulatory environments 
refer to the headings our business challenges and risks above and item a 
risk factors in part i of this report 
as a result  management must make numerous assumptions which involve a significant amount of judgment when determining the recoverability of noncurrent assets in various regions around the world 
for the noncurrent assets listed in the table below  we perform tests of impairment  as appropriate 
for applicable assets  we perform tests when certain conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
for certain assets  we perform tests at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired december  carrying value percentage of total assets in millions except percentages tested for impairment when conditions exist that indicate carrying value may be impaired equity method investments  cost method investments  principally bottling companies other assets  property  plant and equipment  net  amortized intangible assets  net various  principally trademarks total  tested for impairment at least annually or when events indicate that an asset may be impaired trademarks with indefinite lives  goodwill  bottlers franchise rights other intangible assets not subject to amortization total  many of the noncurrent assets listed above are located in markets that we consider to be developing or to have changing political environments 
these markets include  but are not limited to  germany  where the nonrefillable deposit law creates uncertainty  the middle east and egypt  where political and civil unrest continues  the philippines  where affordable packaging and availability of beverages in the marketplace continue to impact operating results  india  where affordability and bottler execution issues remain  and certain markets in latin america  asia and africa  where local economic and political conditions are unstable 
we have bottling assets and investments in many of these markets 
the list in the table below reflects the company s carrying value of noncurrent assets in these markets 
december  carrying value percentage of applicable line item above in millions except percentages tested for impairment when conditions exist that indicate carrying value may be impaired equity method investments cost method investments  principally bottling companies other assets property  plant and equipment  net  amortized intangible assets  net various  principally trademarks total  tested for impairment at least annually or when events indicate that an asset may be impaired trademarks with indefinite lives goodwill bottlers franchise rights other intangible assets not subject to amortization total equity method and cost method investments we review our equity and cost method investments in every reporting period to determine whether a significant event or change in circumstances has occurred that may have an adverse effect on the fair value of each investment 
when such events or changes occur  we evaluate the fair value compared to the carrying value of the related investments 
we also perform this evaluation every reporting period for each investment for which the carrying value has exceeded the fair value in the prior period 
the fair values of most of our company s investments in publicly traded companies are often readily available based on quoted market prices 
for investments in nonpublicly traded companies  management s assessment of fair value is based on valuation methodologies including discounted cash flows  estimates of sales proceeds and external appraisals  as appropriate 
we consider the assumptions that we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use in evaluating estimated future cash flows when employing the discounted cash flows or estimates of sales proceeds valuation methodologies 
the ability to accurately predict future cash flows  especially in developing and unstable markets  may impact the determination of fair value 
in the event a decline in fair value of an investment occurs  management may be required to determine if the decline in fair value is other than temporary 
management s assessments as to the nature of a decline in fair value are based on the valuation methodologies discussed above  our ability and intent to hold the investment  and whether evidence indicating the cost of the investment is recoverable within a reasonable period of time outweighs evidence to the contrary 
we consider most of our equity method investees to be strategic long term investments 
if the fair value of an investment is less than its carrying value and the decline in value is considered to be other than temporary  a write down is recorded 
management s assessments of fair value represent our best estimates as of the time of the impairment review and are consistent with the assumptions that we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use 
if different fair values were estimated  this could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
the following table presents the difference between calculated fair values  based on quoted closing prices of publicly traded shares  and our company s carrying values for significant investments in publicly traded bottlers accounted for as equity method investees in millions december  fair value carrying value difference coca cola enterprises inc    coca cola hellenic bottling company sa   coca cola femsa  sa de sa   coca cola amatil limited  grupo continental  sa coca cola embonor sa coca cola bottling company consolidated coca cola west japan company ltd 
embotelladoras polar sa the current decline in value is considered to be temporary 
other assets our company invests in infrastructure programs with our bottlers that are directed at strengthening our bottling system and increasing unit case volume 
additionally  our company advances payments to certain customers to fund future marketing activities intended to generate profitable volume and expenses such payments over the period benefited 
advance payments are also made to certain customers for distribution rights 
payments under these programs are generally capitalized and reported as other assets in our consolidated balance sheets 
management evaluates the recoverability of the carrying value of these assets when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable by preparing estimates of sales volume and the resulting gross profit and cash flows 
if the carrying value of the assets is assessed to be recoverable  it is amortized over the periods benefited 
if the carrying value of these assets is considered to be not recoverable  an impairment is recognized  resulting in a write down of assets 
property  plant and equipment certain events or changes in circumstances may indicate that the recoverability of the carrying amount of property  plant and equipment should be assessed 
such events or changes may include a significant decrease in market value  a significant change in the business climate in a particular market  or a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with historical losses or projected future losses 
if an event occurs or changes in circumstances are present  we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount  we recognize an impairment loss 
the impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value 
goodwill  trademarks and other intangible assets statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  classifies intangible assets into three categories intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization  intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization  and goodwill 
for intangible assets with definite lives  tests for impairment must be performed if conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
for intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill  tests for impairment must be performed at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired 
our equity method investees also perform such tests for impairment for intangible assets and or goodwill 
if an impairment charge was recorded by one of our equity method investees the company would record its proportionate share of such charge 
our trademarks and other intangible assets determined to have definite lives are amortized over their useful lives 
in accordance with sfas no 
 if conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable  we review such trademarks and other intangible assets with definite lives for impairment to ensure they are appropriately valued 
such conditions may include an economic downturn in a market or a change in the assessment of future operations 
trademarks and other intangible assets determined to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized 
we test such trademarks and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired 
goodwill is not amortized 
we also perform tests for impairment of goodwill annually  or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate it might be impaired 
all goodwill is assigned to reporting units  which are one level below our operating segments 
goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit that benefits from the synergies arising from each business combination 
we perform our impairment tests of goodwill at our reporting unit level 
impairment tests for goodwill include comparing the fair value of the respective reporting unit with its carrying value  including goodwill 
we use a variety of methodologies in conducting these impairment assessments  including cash flow analyses that  when appropriate  are consistent with the assumptions we believe hypothetical marketplace participants would use  estimates of sales proceeds and independent appraisals 
where applicable  we use an appropriate discount rate  based on the company s cost of capital rate or location specific economic factors 
in  our company recorded impairment charges of approximately million related to intangible assets 
these intangible assets relate to trademarks for beverages sold in the philippines 
the philippines is a component of our east  south asia and pacific rim operating segment 
the carrying value of our trademarks in the philippines  prior to the recording of the impairment charges in  was approximately million 
the impairment was the result of our revised outlook of the philippines  which has been unfavorably impacted by declines in volume and income before income taxes resulting from the continued lack of an affordable package offering and the continued limited availability of these trademark beverages in the marketplace 
we determined the amount of the impairment by comparing the fair value of the intangible assets to the current carrying value 
fair values were derived using discounted cash flow analyses with a number of scenarios that were weighted based on the probability of different outcomes 
because the fair values were less than the carrying values of the assets  we recorded impairment charges to reduce the carrying values of the assets to fair values 
in addition  in  we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million in the line item equity income net related to our proportionate share of a write down of intangible assets recorded by our equity method investee bottler in the philippines 
our company is evaluating and implementing new strategies for the philippines to address structural issues with the bottling system and product affordability and availability issues 
if the results of these strategies do not achieve our current expectations  future charges could result related to both our remaining intangible assets as well as our equity method investment in the philippines bottling operation 
management will continue to monitor the philippines and conduct impairment reviews as required 
in  our company recorded impairment charges related to intangible assets of approximately million  primarily related to franchise rights at cceag in the european union operating segment 
the cceag impairment was the result of our revised outlook for the german market  which was unfavorably impacted by volume declines resulting from market shifts related to the deposit law on nonrefillable beverage packages and the corresponding lack of availability of our products in the discount retail channel 
the deposit law in germany had led to discount chains creating proprietary nonrefillable packages that could only be returned to their own stores 
we determined the amount of the impairment by comparing the fair value of the intangible assets to the current carrying value 
fair values were derived using discounted cash flow analyses with a number of scenarios that were weighted based on the probability of different outcomes 
because the fair value was less than the carrying value of the assets  we recorded an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the assets to fair value 
these impairment charges were recorded in the line item other operating charges in our consolidated statement of income for at the end of  the german government passed an amendment to the mandatory deposit legislation that requires retailers  including discount chains  to accept returns of each type of nonrefillable beverage packages they sell  regardless of where the beverage package type was purchased 
in addition  the mandatory deposit requirement was expanded to other beverage categories 
the amendment allows for a transition period to enable manufacturers and retailers to establish a national take back system for nonrefillable containers by mid in the second half of  the company achieved a limited range of availability of our products in most discounters 
as a result  the business in germany stabilized in the second half of we currently expect that the national take back system  when fully implemented  will create an opportunity to improve package choice and differentiation for nonrefillable packages 
we expect the german business to continue to stabilize in our company evaluated our strategies for the german operations  including addressing significant structural issues that limit the system s ability to respond effectively to the evolving retail and consumer landscape  by assessing market changes and determining our expectations related to the political environment 
we concluded that  in order to better serve our customers and control the costs in our supply chain  we need to simplify our bottling and distribution operations in germany and work toward a single bottler system 
as a result  we informed our independent bottling partners in germany that their bottlers agreements will not be renewed when they expire  from through the independent bottling partners in germany and our company signed a letter of understanding with respect to the formation of a single bottler system and are working to agree to an approach 
if the results of our strategies in germany do not achieve our current expectations  or delays and changes occur in the establishment of the national take back system for nonrefillable packages  future impairment charges could result 
management will continue to monitor these factors 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of products has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
for our company  this generally means that we recognize revenue when title to our products is transferred to our bottling partners  resellers or other customers 
in particular  title usually transfers upon shipment to or receipt at our customers locations  as determined by the specific sales terms of the transaction 
in addition  our customers can earn certain incentives  which are included in deductions from revenue  a component of net operating revenues in the consolidated statements of income 
these incentives include  but are not limited to  cash discounts  funds for promotional and marketing activities  volume based incentive programs  and support for infrastructure programs 
refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the aggregate deductions from revenue recorded by the company in relation to these programs  including amortization expense on infrastructure programs  was approximately billion  billion and billion for the years ended december   and  respectively 
income taxes our annual tax rate is based on our income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions 
we establish reserves at the time we determine it is probable we will be liable to pay additional taxes related to certain matters 
we adjust these reserves  including any impact on the related interest and penalties  in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of a tax audit 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved 
the number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction 
while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter  we record a reserve when we determine the likelihood of loss is probable 
such liabilities are recorded in the line item accrued income taxes in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash 
favorable resolutions of tax matters for which we have previously established reserves are recognized as a reduction to our income tax expense when the amounts involved become known 
tax law requires items to be included in the tax return at different times than when these items are reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
as a result  our annual tax rate reflected in our consolidated financial statements is different than that reported in our tax return our cash tax rate 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return  and some differences reverse over time  such as depreciation expense 
these timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
the tax rates used to determine deferred tax assets or liabilities are the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
based on the evaluation of all available information  the company recognizes future tax benefits  such as net operating loss carryforwards  to the extent that realizing these benefits is considered more likely than not 
we evaluate our ability to realize the tax benefits associated with deferred tax assets by analyzing our forecasted taxable income using both historical and projected future operating results  the reversal of existing temporary differences  taxable income in prior carryback years if permitted and the availability of tax planning strategies 
a valuation allowance is required to be established unless management determines that it is more likely than not that the company will ultimately realize the tax benefit associated with a deferred tax asset 
additionally  undistributed earnings of a subsidiary are accounted for as a temporary difference  except that deferred tax liabilities are not recorded for undistributed earnings of a foreign subsidiary that are deemed to be indefinitely reinvested in the foreign jurisdiction 
the company has formulated a specific plan for reinvestment of undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries which demonstrates that such earnings will be indefinitely reinvested in the applicable jurisdictions 
should we change our plans  we would be required to record a significant amount of deferred tax liabilities 
the american jobs creation act of the jobs creation act was enacted in october among other things  it provided a one time benefit related to foreign tax credits generated by equity investments in prior years 
in  the company recorded an income tax benefit of approximately million as a result of this new law 
the jobs creation act also included a temporary incentive for us multinationals to repatriate foreign earnings at an approximate percent effective tax rate 
during  the company repatriated approximately billion in previously unremitted foreign earnings  with an associated tax liability of approximately million 
the reinvestment requirements of this repatriation are expected to be fulfilled by and are not expected to require any material change in the nature  amount or timing of future expenditures from what was otherwise expected 
refer to note and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company s effective tax rate is expected to be approximately percent in this estimated tax rate does not reflect the impact of any unusual or special items that may affect our tax rate in contingencies our company is subject to various claims and contingencies  mostly related to legal proceedings 
due to their nature  such legal proceedings involve inherent uncertainties including  but not limited to  court rulings  negotiations between affected parties and governmental actions 
management assesses the probability of loss for such contingencies and accrues a liability and or discloses the relevant circumstances  as appropriate 
management believes that any liability to the company that may arise as a result of currently pending legal proceedings or other contingencies will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the company taken as a whole

operations review we manufacture  distribute and market nonalcoholic beverage concentrates and syrups in more than countries around the world 
we also manufacture  distribute and market some finished beverages 
due to our global presence  we are primarily managed by geographic regions 
our organizational structure as of december  consisted of the following operating segments  the first six of which are sometimes referred to as operating groups or groups north america  africa  east  south asia and pacific rim  european union  latin america  north asia  eurasia and middle east  and corporate 
for further information regarding our operating segments  including a discussion of changes made to our operating segments during  refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
volume we measure our sales volume in two ways unit cases of finished products and gallons 
a unit case is a unit of measurement equal to us fluid ounces of finished beverage eight ounce servings 
unit case volume represents the number of unit cases of company beverage products directly or indirectly sold by the coca cola system to customers 
unit case volume primarily consists of beverage products bearing company trademarks 
also included in unit case volume are certain products licensed to  or distributed by  our company  and brands owned by coca cola system bottlers for which our company provides marketing support and from the sale of which it derives income 
such products licensed to  or distributed by  our company or owned by coca cola system bottlers account for a minimal portion of total unit case volume 
in addition  unit case volume includes sales by joint ventures in which the company is a partner 
unit case volume is derived based on estimates supplied by our bottling partners and distributors 
a gallon is a unit of measurement for concentrates  syrups  beverage bases  finished beverages and powders in all cases expressed in equivalent gallons of syrup sold by the company to its bottling partners or other customers 
most of our revenues are based on gallon sales  a primarily wholesale activity  as discussed under item business in part i of this report and the heading operations review net operating revenues  below 
unit case volume and gallon sales growth rates are not necessarily equal during any given period 
items such as seasonality  bottlers inventory practices  supply point changes  timing of price increases and new product introductions and changes in product mix can impact unit case volume and gallon sales and can create differences between unit case volume and gallon sales growth rates 
information about our volume growth by operating segment is as follows percentage change vs

increase in gallon sales structural changes price and product geographic mix impact of currency fluctuations versus the us dollar total percentage increase refer to the heading volume for a detailed discussion on gallon sales 
structural changes refers to acquisitions or dispositions of bottling or canning operations and consolidation or deconsolidation of entities for accounting purposes 
during the third quarter of  our company acquired the german soft drink bottling company bremer erfrischungsgetraenke gmbh bremer 
refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
structural changes also reflect the impact of a full year of revenue in for variable interest entities compared to a partial year in under interpretation r  the results of operations of variable interest entities in which the company was determined to be the primary beneficiary were included in our consolidated results beginning april  refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the favorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations in versus resulted from the strength of most key foreign currencies versus the us dollar  especially a stronger euro that favorably impacted the european union operating segment  and a stronger brazilian real and mexican peso that favorably impacted our latin america operating segment 
the favorable impact of fluctuation in these currencies was offset by a weaker japanese yen that unfavorably impacted the north asia  eurasia and middle east operating segment 
refer to the heading liquidity  capital resources and financial position foreign exchange 
structural changes resulted in a decrease in net operating revenues in compared to  primarily due to the creation of a national supply chain company in japan in effective october   the company and all of our bottling partners in japan created a nationally integrated supply chain management company to centralize procurement  production and logistics operations for the entire coca cola system in japan 
as a result  a portion of our company s business was essentially converted from a finished product business model to a concentrate business model 
this shift of certain products to a concentrate business model resulted in reductions in our revenues and cost of goods sold  each in the same amount 
this change in the business model did not impact gross profit 
the decrease in net revenues from to attributable to the japan structural change was approximately million  which was partially offset by an approximately million increase in revenues associated with the consolidation as of april  of certain bottling operations that are considered variable interest entities under interpretation r 
refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the impact of foreign currency fluctuations versus the us dollar in versus was driven primarily by the stronger euro  which favorably impacted the european union operating segment  and the stronger japanese yen  which favorably impacted the north asia  eurasia and middle east operating segment 
information about our net operating revenues by operating segment on a percentage basis is as follows year ended december  north america africa east  south asia and pacific rim european union latin america north asia  eurasia and middle east corporate the percentage contribution of each operating segment has changed due to net operating revenues in certain segments growing at a faster rate compared to the other operating segments and the impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
effective january   the company granted our bottling partners in spain the rights to manufacture and distribute company trademarked products in can packages 
prior to granting these rights to our bottling partners  the company held the manufacturing and distribution rights for these can packages in spain 
as a result of granting these rights  the company will reduce our planned future annual marketing support payments made to our bottling partners in spain 
as a result  a portion of our company s business has essentially been converted from a finished product business model to a concentrate business model 
this shift to a concentrate business model will result in an annual reduction to net revenues 
the company estimates the decrease in annual net revenues from this structural change to be approximately million 
we do not believe this change in business model will have a significant impact on gross profit 
the size and timing of structural changes  including acquisitions or dispositions of bottling and canning operations  do not occur consistently from period to period 
as a result  anticipating the impact of such events on future increases or decreases in net operating revenues and other financial statement line items usually is not possible 
however  we expect to continue to sell bottling and canning interests and buy bottling and canning interests in limited circumstances and  as a result  structural changes will continue to affect our consolidated financial statements in future periods 
gross profit our gross profit margin decreased to percent in from percent in  primarily due to higher raw material and freight costs driven by rising oil prices 
this decrease was partially offset by the receipt of settlement proceeds of approximately million related to a class action lawsuit settlement concerning price fixing in the sale of high fructose corn syrup purchased by the company during the years to subsequent to the receipt of this settlement  the company distributed approximately million to certain bottlers in north america 
from to  the company purchased high fructose corn syrup on behalf of these bottlers  therefore  these bottlers were ultimately entitled to the proceeds of the settlement

our company intends to maintain the increased level in marketing and innovation spending for the foreseeable future 
the decrease in stock based compensation expense is primarily related to the lower average fair value per share of stock options expensed in the current year compared to the average fair value per share expensed in this decrease was partially offset by approximately million of accelerated amortization of compensation expense related to a change in our estimated service period for retirement eligible participants when the terms of their stock based compensation awards provided for accelerated vesting upon early retirement

the loan is convertible into preferred shares of tccbce upon receipt of governmental approvals 
additionally  upon certain defaults under either the loan agreement or the terms of the preferred shares  we have the ability to convert the loan or the preferred shares into common shares 
at december   our company owned approximately percent of the common shares of tccbce 
the company consolidated tccbce under interpretation r effective april  refer to note and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in november  coca cola hbc approved a share capital reduction totaling approximately million euros and the return of euros per share to all shareowners 
in december  our company received our share capital return payment from coca cola hbc equivalent to million which is included in the line item other investing activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows 
refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
cash flows from financing activities our cash flows used in financing activities were as follows in millions year ended december  cash flows provided by used in financing activities issuances of debt   payments of debt    issuances of stock purchases of stock for treasury    dividends    net cash used in financing activities   debt financing our company maintains debt levels we consider prudent based on our cash flow  interest coverage ratio and percentage of debt to capital 
we use debt financing to lower our overall cost of capital  which increases our return on shareowners equity 
as of december   our long term debt was rated a by standard poor s and aa by moody s  and our commercial paper program was rated a and p by standard poor s and moody s  respectively 
in assessing our credit strength  both standard poor s and moody s consider our capital structure and financial policies as well as the aggregated balance sheet and other financial information for the company and certain bottlers  including cce and coca cola hbc 
while the company has no legal obligation for the debt of these bottlers  the rating agencies believe the strategic importance of the bottlers to the company s business model provides the company with an incentive to keep these bottlers viable 
if our credit ratings were reduced by the rating agencies  our interest expense could increase 
additionally  if certain bottlers credit ratings were to decline  the company s share of equity income could be reduced as a result of the potential increase in interest expense for these bottlers 
we monitor our interest coverage ratio and  as indicated above  the rating agencies consider our ratio in assessing our credit ratings 
however  the rating agencies aggregate financial data for certain bottlers along with our company when assessing our debt rating 
as such  the key measure to rating agencies is the aggregate interest coverage ratio of the company and certain bottlers 
both standard poor s and moody s employ different aggregation methodologies and have different thresholds for the aggregate interest coverage ratio 
these thresholds are not necessarily permanent  nor are they fully disclosed to our company 
our global presence and strong capital position give us access to key financial markets around the world  enabling us to raise funds at a low effective cost 
this posture  coupled with active management of our mix of short term and long term debt and our mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt  results in a lower overall cost of borrowing 
our debt management policies  in conjunction with our share repurchase programs and investment activity  can result in current liabilities exceeding current assets 
issuances and payments of debt included both short term and long term financing activities 
on december   we had  million in lines of credit and other short term credit facilities available  of which approximately million was outstanding

our annual common stock dividend was per share  per share and per share in  and  respectively 
the dividend represented a percent increase from  and the dividend represented a percent increase from off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations off balance sheet arrangements in accordance with the definition under sec rules  the following qualify as off balance sheet arrangements any obligation under certain guarantee contracts  a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit  liquidity or market risk support to that entity for such assets  any obligation under certain derivative instruments  and any obligation arising out of a material variable interest held by the registrant in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support to the registrant  or engages in leasing  hedging or research and development services with the registrant 
the following discusses certain obligations and arrangements involving our company 
on december   our company was contingently liable for guarantees of indebtedness owed by third parties in the amount of approximately million 
management concluded that the likelihood of any material amounts being paid by our company is not probable 
as of december   we were not directly liable for the debt of any unconsolidated entity  and we did not have any retained or contingent interest in assets as defined above 
our company recognizes all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets 
refer to note and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in december  we granted a million standby line of credit to coca cola femsa with normal market terms 
as of december   no amounts have been drawn against this line of credit 
this standby line of credit expires in december aggregate contractual obligations as of december   the company s contractual obligations  including payments due by period  were as follows in millions payments due by period total and thereafter short term loans and notes payable commercial paper borrowings   lines of credit and other short term borrowings current maturities of long term debt long term debt  net of current maturities  estimated interest payments  marketing and other commitments    purchase commitments    liability to cceag shareowners   other contractual obligations total contractual obligations    refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding short term loans and notes payable 
upon payment of commercial paper borrowings  we typically issue new commercial paper borrowings 
lines of credit and other short term borrowings are expected to fluctuate depending upon current liquidity needs  especially at international subsidiaries 
refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding long term debt 
we will consider several alternatives to settle this long term debt  including the use of cash flows from operating activities  issuance of commercial paper or issuance of other long term debt 
we calculated estimated interest payments for long term debt as follows for fixed rate debt and term debt  we calculated interest based on the applicable rates and payment dates  for variable rate debt and or non term debt  we estimated interest rates and payment dates based on our determination of the most likely scenarios for each relevant debt instrument 
we typically expect to settle such interest payments with cash flows from operating activities and or short term borrowings 
we expect to fund these marketing and other commitments with cash flows from operating activities 
we have excluded expected payments for marketing programs that are generally determined and committed to on an annual basis 
the purchase commitments include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including open purchase orders 
we expect to fund these commitments with cash flows from operating activities 
the amount represents the estimated cash to be paid to cceag shareowners 
refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the present value of our liability to cceag shareowners 
we will consider several alternatives to settle this liability  including the use of cash flows from operating activities  issuance of commercial paper or issuance of other long term debt 
other contractual obligations consist primarily of future minimum lease payments under our non cancelable leasing arrangements  with an initial term in excess of one year 
in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  the total accrued benefit liability for pension and other postretirement benefit plans recognized as of december   was  million 
refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
this accrued liability is included in the consolidated balance sheet line item other liabilities 
this amount is impacted by  among other items  funding levels  changes in plan demographics and assumptions  and investment return on plan assets 
because the accrued liability does not represent expected liquidity needs  we did not include this amount in the contractual obligations table 
we fund our us qualified pension plans in accordance with employee retirement income security act of regulations for the minimum annual required contribution and in accordance with internal revenue service regulations for the maximum annual allowable tax deduction 
the minimum required contribution for our primary qualified us pension plan for the plan year is and is anticipated to remain for at least the next several years due to contributions made to the plan between and therefore  we did not include any amounts as a contractual obligation in the above table 
we do  however  anticipate contributing up to the maximum deductible amount to the primary us qualified pension plan in  which is estimated to be approximately million 
furthermore  we expect to contribute up to million to the us postretirement health care benefit plan during we generally expect to fund all future contributions with cash flows from operating activities 
our international pension plans are funded in accordance with local laws and income tax regulations 
we do not expect contributions to these plans to be material in or thereafter 
therefore  no amounts have been included in the table above 
as of december   the projected benefit obligation of the us qualified pension plans was  million  and the fair value of plan assets was  million 
as of december   the projected benefit obligation of all pension plans other than the us qualified pension plans was  million  and the fair value of all other pension plan assets was million 
the majority of this underfunding is attributable to an international pension plan for certain non us employees that is unfunded due to tax law restrictions  as well as our unfunded us nonqualified pension plans 
these us nonqualified pension plans provide  for certain associates  benefits that are not permitted to be funded through a qualified plan because of limits imposed by the internal revenue code of disclosure of amounts in the above table regarding expected benefit payments for our unfunded pension plans and our other postretirement benefit plans cannot be properly reflected for and thereafter due to the ongoing nature of the obligations of these plans 
however  in order to inform the reader about expected benefit payments for these unfunded plans over the next several years  we anticipate annual benefit payments to be in the range of approximately million to million in and remain at or near this annual level for the next several years 
deferred income tax liabilities as of december   were million 
refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
this amount is not included in the total contractual obligations table because we believe this presentation would not be meaningful 
deferred income tax liabilities are calculated based on temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their book basis  which will result in taxable amounts in future years when the book basis is settled 
the results of these calculations do not have a direct connection with the amount of cash taxes to be paid in any future periods 
as a result  scheduling deferred income tax liabilities as payments due by period could be misleading  because this scheduling would not relate to liquidity needs 
minority interests of million as of december   for consolidated entities in which we do not have a percent ownership interest were recorded in the consolidated balance sheet line item other liabilities 
such minority interests are not liabilities requiring the use of cash or other resources  therefore  this amount is excluded from the contractual obligations table 
foreign exchange our international operations are subject to opportunities and risks relating to foreign currency fluctuations 
we closely monitor our operations in each country and seek to adopt appropriate strategies that are responsive to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
we use functional currencies 
due to our global operations  weaknesses in some of these currencies might be offset by strengths in others 
in  and  the weighted average exchange rates for foreign currencies in which the company conducted operations all operating currencies  and for certain individual currencies  strengthened weakened against the us dollar as follows year ended december  all operating currencies brazilian real mexican peso australian dollar euro south african rand british pound japanese yen these percentages do not include the effects of our hedging activities and  therefore  do not reflect the actual impact of fluctuations in exchange rates on our operating results 
our foreign currency management program is designed to mitigate  over time  a portion of the impact of exchange rates on net income and earnings per share 
the total currency impact on operating income  including the effect of our hedging activities  was an increase of approximately percent  percent and percent in  and  respectively 
in  the company expects a negative impact on operating income from currencies 
exchange losses net amounted to approximately million in  million in and million in and were recorded in other loss net in our consolidated statements of income 
exchange losses net include the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities from certain currencies into functional currencies and the costs of hedging certain exposures of our consolidated balance sheets 
refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company will continue to manage its foreign currency exposure to mitigate  over time  a portion of the impact of exchange rate changes on net income and earnings per share 
overview of financial position our consolidated balance sheet as of december   compared to our consolidated balance sheet as of december   was impacted by the following the decrease in loans and notes payable of million was primarily due to the decrease of commercial paper borrowings during of million and was offset by the reclassification of the payment to be made to cceag shareholders from other liabilities to loans and notes payable 
refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the increase in our equity method investments in of million was primarily due to the payment of approximately million for our share of the joint acquisition of multon 
the increase also includes the impact of the strength in most key currencies versus the us dollar and equity income  net of dividends 
refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the overall decrease in total assets of  million as of december   compared to december   was primarily related to the decrease in cash and cash equivalents  which impacted the corporate operating segment 
the decrease was also due to impairment charges primarily for trademarks amounting to approximately million 
the decrease was partially offset by the impact of the strength in most key currencies versus the us dollar  especially a stronger brazilian real and mexican peso which impacted the latin america operating segment and a stronger euro which impacted the european union operating segment 
refer to the heading operations review other operating charges for a discussion of the impairment charges 
impact of inflation and changing prices inflation affects the way we operate in many markets around the world 
in general  we believe that  over time  we are able to increase prices to counteract the majority of the inflationary effects of increasing costs and to generate sufficient cash flows to maintain our productive capability 
additional information in the first quarter of  the company made certain changes to its operating structure primarily to establish a new  separate internal organization for its consolidated bottling operations and its unconsolidated bottling investments 
this new structure will result in the reporting of a separate operating segment  along with the six existing geographic operating segments and corporate  beginning with the first quarter of for additional information concerning our operating segments as of december   refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our company uses derivative financial instruments primarily to reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and  to a lesser extent  adverse fluctuations in interest rates and commodity prices and other market risks 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
as a matter of policy  all our derivative positions are used to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure 
because of the high correlation between the hedging instrument and the underlying exposure  fluctuations in the value of the instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying exposure 
virtually all of our derivatives are straightforward  over the counter instruments with liquid markets 
foreign exchange we manage most of our foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis  which allows us to net certain exposures and take advantage of any natural offsets 
in  we generated approximately percent of our net operating revenues from operations outside of our north america operating group  therefore  weakness in one particular currency might be offset by strengths in others over time 
we use derivative financial instruments to further reduce our net exposure to currency fluctuations 
our company enters into forward exchange contracts and purchases currency options principally euro and japanese yen and collars to hedge certain portions of forecasted cash flows denominated in foreign currencies 
additionally  we enter into forward exchange contracts to offset the earnings impact relating to exchange rate fluctuations on certain monetary assets and liabilities 
we also enter into forward exchange contracts as hedges of net investments in international operations 
interest rates we monitor our mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt  as well as our mix of term debt versus non term debt 
from time to time we enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt 
value at risk we monitor our exposure to financial market risks using several objective measurement systems  including value at risk models 
our value at risk calculations use a historical simulation model to estimate potential future losses in the fair value of our derivatives and other financial instruments that could occur as a result of adverse movements in foreign currency and interest rates 
we have not considered the potential impact of favorable movements in foreign currency and interest rates on our calculations 
we examined historical weekly returns over the previous years to calculate our value at risk 
the average value at risk represents the simple average of quarterly amounts over the past year 
as a result of our foreign currency value at risk calculations  we estimate with percent confidence that the fair values of our foreign currency derivatives and other financial instruments  over a one week period  would decline by less than million  million and million  respectively  using  or average fair values  and by less than million and million  respectively  using december  and fair values 
according to our interest rate value at risk calculations  we estimate with percent confidence that any increase in our net interest expense due to an adverse move in our average or in our december   interest rates over a one week period would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
our december  and estimates also were not material to our consolidated financial statements
