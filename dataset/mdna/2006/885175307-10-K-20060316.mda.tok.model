we undertake no obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward looking statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof  or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
the following presentation of management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
overview we are a leading manufacturer of circulatory support products for use by patients with heart failure  or hf 
our ventricular assist devices  or vads  are used primarily by hf patients to perform some or all of the pumping function of the heart 
we currently offer the widest range of products to serve this market 
we believe that our long standing reputation for quality and innovation and our excellent relationships with leading cardiovascular surgeons worldwide position us to capture growth opportunities in the expanding hf market 
through our wholly owned subsidiary  itc  we design  develop  manufacture and market point of care diagnostic test systems and incision products that provide for fast  accurate blood test results to improve patient management  reduce healthcare costs and improve patient outcomes 
our business model our business is comprised of two segments cardiovascular and itc 
the product line of our cardiovascular segment is circulatory support products 
our circulatory support products include vads for the short  intermediate and long term treatment of advanced heart failure 
in addition  we have developed small diameter grafts using our proprietary materials to address the vascular access market 
our grafts are used for hemodialysis 
the product lines of our itc segment are point of care diagnostics 
our point of care products include coagulation diagnostic test systems that monitor a patient while being administered certain anticoagulants  blood gas electrolyte and chemistry status  or anemia 
incision 
our incision products include devices used to obtain a patient s blood sample for diagnostic testing and screening for platelet function 
cardiovascular segment we offer the following broad product portfolio of implantable and external circulatory support devices the thoratec ventricular assist device system is an external device for short to mid term cardiac support  which is sold worldwide 
the device is approved to assist left  right and biventricle support and is worn outside of the body 
the thoratec vad is approved for use in bridge to transplantation  or btt and for post cardiotomy myocardial recovery 
the thoratec ivad is the only implantable blood pump approved for both btt and post cardiotomy myocardial recovery 
it can be used for left  right  or biventricular support 
the ivad utilizes the same internal working components as the thoratec vad system  but has an outer housing made of a titanium alloy that makes it more suitable for implantation 
the heartmate xve left ventricular assist system  or lvas  is an implantable device for mid to long term cardiac support and the only device approved in the us  europe and canada for permanent support for those patients ineligible for heart transplantation 
the heartmate xve is also approved for use in btt 
the heartmate ii  which is currently in clinical trials for btt and destination therapy  is an implantable device consisting of a miniature rotary blood pump designed to provide long term cardiac support 
its design is intended to be not only smaller  but also simpler  quieter  and longer lasting than the current generation of ventricular assist devices 
in addition to our cardiac assist products  we sell vascular access grafts  used in hemodialysis for patients with late stage renal disease 
the primary markets for our vad products are those patients suffering from heart failure and  in particular  from late stage hf 
hf is a chronic disease that occurs when degeneration of the heart muscle reduces the pumping power of the heart  causing the heart 
table of contents to become too weak to pump blood at a level adequate to meet the body s demands 
hf can be caused by artery or valve diseases or a general weakening of the heart muscle itself 
other conditions  such as high blood pressure or diabetes  can also lead to hf 
in the united states  we currently have two fda approved indications for the use of vads in patients with hf as a bridge to heart transplant and as destination therapy 
we are currently pursuing an additional indication for our thoratec vad products therapeutic recovery of the heart 
beyond the hf markets  vads are also approved for use during recovery following cardiac surgery 
we currently market vads that may be implanted or worn outside the body and that are suitable for treatments for different durations for patients of varying sizes and ages 
we estimate that doctors have implanted nearly  of our devices in patients suffering from heart failure 
our devices are currently used primarily for patients awaiting a heart transplant or as destination therapy implants 
on november   the united states food and drug administration  or fda  approved the heartmate vad as the first heart assist device for destination therapy 
on april   the fda approved the heartmate xve  an enhanced version of the heartmate vad  for destination therapy 
thoratec is the only company to have a ventricular assist device approved for destination therapy in the united states 
in august  we received fda approval in the us to market the ivad for use in bridge to transplantation and post cardiotomy recovery patients who are unable to be weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass 
this makes the ivad the only currently approved implantable cardiac assist device that can provide left  right or biventricular support 
itc segment the major product lines of point of care  or poc  diagnostic test systems and incision device products are the hemochron poc coagulation system  which is used to monitor a patient s coagulation while being administered anticoagulants in various settings  including in the cardiovascular operating room to monitor the drug heparin and in an anticoagulation clinic to monitor the drug coumadin 
hemochron is considered a moderately complex device and must be used by professionally trained personnel 
the system consists of a small  portable analytical instrument and disposable test cuvettes 
the irma poc blood gas electrolyte and chemistry system  which is used to monitor a patient s blood gas electrolyte and chemistry status 
it is considered moderately complex and its use requires supervision by professionally trained personnel 
the system consists of a small  portable analytical instrument and disposable test cartridges 
the protime coagulation monitoring system  which is used to monitor patients coagulation while they are taking oral anticoagulants such as coumadin  and can be prescribed for use by patients at home or can be used in the physician s office or clinic 
the system consists of a small  portable  analytical instrument and disposable test cuvettes 
the hemoglobin pro  or hgb pro  is used by professionals  mainly in the doctor s office to test for anemia  it provides quick results from a very small blood sample 
the system consists of a small  hand held test meter and disposable test strips 
tenderfoot  tenderlett and surgicutt incision products  which are used by professionals to obtain a patient s blood sample for diagnostic testing 
the tenderfoot is a heel stick used for infant testing  the tenderlett is used for finger incisions and the surgicutt is used to perform screening tests to determine platelet function 
all products feature permanently retracting blades for safe  virtually pain free incision 
the hemochron and irma products are primarily sold into the hospital poc segment of the market 
the protime and hemoglobin pro products are sold into the alternate site non hospital poc market comprising physicians offices  long term care facilities  clinics  visiting nurse associations  and home healthcare companies 
our incision products are sold to both the hospital poc and the alternate site poc markets 
our most successful incision product is the tenderfoot 
although we market this product based on its high end features  we believe that customers are increasingly making purchasing decisions on these types of products based on price 
we have seen a gradual erosion of market share in the current year 
acquisitions on september   we completed an asset purchase of the immediate response mobile analysis  or irma  point of care blood analysis system product line from diametrics medical  inc we paid approximately million in cash and assumed trade payables 
the purchase price was allocated based on the fair value of assets acquired as determined by an independent valuation firm 
there was no goodwill recorded with the transaction 
as a result of the acquisition   relating to in process research and development was expensed in the fourth quarter of 
table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact of  and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations are discussed below 
for a more detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
make whole premium under the terms of our senior subordinated convertible notes issued in  if we experience a change in control or a termination of trading of our common stock  each note holder may require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes at a price equal to the issue price plus any original issue discount 
in addition  if the consideration for the change in control is all cash  the company will pay a make whole premium to the note holders 
this premium is considered an embedded derivative under sfas and has been bifurcated from the convertible notes and recorded at its estimated fair value  million and none at december  and january   respectively 
there are significant variables and assumptions used in valuing the make whole provision including  but not limited to  the company s stock price  volatility of the company s stock  the probability of acquisition and the probability of the type of consideration used by a potential acquirer 
if any of these variables move significantly or if management s assumptions prove incorrect  our financial statements could be materially and adversely affected 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales for our cardiovascular and itc business segments when evidence of an arrangement exists  title has passed generally upon shipment or services have been rendered  the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
sales to distributors are recorded when title transfers upon shipment 
one of our distributors has certain limited product return rights 
other distributors have certain rights of return upon termination of their distribution agreement 
a reserve for sales returns is recorded for these customers applying reasonable estimates of product returns based upon historical experience 
no other direct sales customers or distributors have return rights or price protection 
we recognize sales of certain cardiovascular segment products to first time customers when we have determined that the customer has the ability to use such products 
these sales frequently include the sale of products and training services under multiple element arrangements 
training is not considered essential to the functionality of the products 
the amount of revenue under these arrangements allocated to training is based upon fair market value of the training  which is typically performed on behalf of the company by third party providers 
the amount of product sales allocated to the cardiovascular segment products is done on a fair value basis 
under this basis  the total value of the arrangement is allocated to the training and the cardiovascular segment products based on the relative fair market value of the training and products 
the majority of our products are covered by up to a two year limited manufacturer s warranty from the date of shipment or installation 
estimated contractual warranty obligations are recorded when related sales are recognized and any additional amounts are recorded when such costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated 
in determining when to recognize revenue  management makes decisions on such matters as the fair values of the product and training elements when sold together  customer credit worthiness and warranty reserves 
if these decisions prove incorrect  the carrying value of these assets and liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheets could be significantly different and it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for any fiscal period 
reserves we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make payments owed to us for product sales 
when the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the majority of our products are covered by up to a two year limited manufacturer s warranty 
estimated contractual warranty obligations are recorded when related sales are recognized and any additional amounts are recorded when such costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated and are included in cost of product sales 

table of contents we have provided adequate amounts for anticipated tax audit adjustments in the us  state and other foreign tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes and interest may be due 
if events occur which indicate payment of these amounts are unnecessary  the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 
if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  a further charge to expense would result 
management must make judgments to determine the amount of reserves to accrue 
if management estimates prove incorrect  our financial statements could be materially and adversely affected 
evaluation of purchased intangibles and goodwill for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we periodically evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets to be held and used  including intangible assets subject to amortization  when events or circumstances warrant such a review 
the carrying value of a long lived asset to be held and used is considered impaired when the anticipated separately identifiable undiscounted cash flows from such an asset are less than the carrying value of the asset 
in that event  a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long lived asset 
fair value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
management must make estimates of these future cash flows and the approximate discount rate  and if any of these estimates proves incorrect  the carrying value of these assets on our consolidated balance sheet could become significantly impaired 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we no longer amortize goodwill 
we complete an impairment test of goodwill and other intangible assets subject to amortization as required by sfas no 
and sfas no 
upon completion of our impairment tests as of the end of the year  we determined that neither goodwill nor intangible assets were impaired 
results of operations the following table sets forth selected consolidated statements of operations data for the years indicated as a percentage of total product sales fiscal year product sales cost of product sales gross profit operating expenses selling  general administrative research and development amortization of purchased intangible assets impairment of intangible asset litigation  restructuring and other costs total operating expenses income loss from operations other income and expense interest expense interest income and other income loss before taxes income tax expense benefit net income loss fiscal years and product sales product sales in were million compared to million in the cardiovascular segment increased sales by million and the itc segment increased sales by million 
product sales increases are due to an increase in volume unless otherwise noted 
the primary components of the total million increase in product sales were the following 
table of contents vad product sales increased million 
the increase came from higher sales of our heartmate ii and ivad products  partially offset by a reduction in sales of our pvad and xve product lines 
other ancillary revenue drivers  cannulae  service  rentals and spares increased million  including increases in driver rental revenue and cannulae sales associated with the ivad product line 
graft product sales increased by million  principally due to the recognition of a payment related to the modification of our distribution agreement with cr bard corporation in december as well as a higher average selling price 
point of care diagnostic product sales increased million  due primarily to increases in our sales of protime  irma  and hemochron products partially offset by a modest decrease in sales of our hgb pro products year over year 
incision product sales were down million year over year 
sales originating outside of the united states and us export sales accounted for approximately of our total product sales in and gross profit gross profit as a percentage of product sales for and was and  respectively 
the increase in gross profit was due to the proportionate sales of itc versus cardiovascular products in conjunction with the following the cardiovascular segment increased gross profit by due to increased sales of higher margin vad products  coupled with a decrease in manufacturing costs  and the itc segment increased gross profit by  due to higher margin sales in the point of care product line and reduced manufacturing costs 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses in were million  or of product sales  compared to million  or of product sales  in the million increase in spending was primarily attributable to the following increased personnel costs of million associated with ceo transition  cfo recruitment  and other bonus and retention programs not specifically identified to any particular business segment 
increased personnel costs associated with higher product sales and overall headcount increases in the cardiovascular segment of million partially offset by a million decrease in personnel costs for the itc segment 
higher spending on marketing and related activities primarily associated with destination therapy and costs associated with training efforts in the cardiovascular segment totaling million  in addition to a million increase in spending by the itc segment related to increased group purchasing organization and consulting fees partially offset by a decrease of million related to travel and supplies 
research and development research and development expenses in were million  or of product sales  compared to million  or of product sales  in of the million increase  our cardiovascular and itc segments incurred million and million  in additional expenses  respectively  year over year 
research and development costs are largely project driven  and the level of spending depends on the level of project activity planned and subsequently approved and conducted 
the primary component of our research and development costs is employee salaries and benefits 
research and development costs also include regulatory and clinical costs associated with our compliance with fda regulations and clinical trials such as the phase ii heartmate ii pivotal trial 
amortization of purchased intangible assets amortization of purchased intangible assets in was million compared to million in the million decrease is the result of changes in certain asset lives in january as a result of our sfas no 
impairment test

interest income and other interest income and other in was million compared to million in this increase was primarily due to higher interest income earned on our portfolio based on increased average cash balances and higher interest rates in compared with income taxes our effective tax rate was in compared to in the increase in our effective tax rate on a comparative basis was due primarily to a combination of a significant increase in current profitability and increased nondeductible executive compensation  offset in part by increased interest income from tax favorable investments and increased research and development credits 
fiscal years and product sales product sales in were million compared to million in the primary components of the million  or  increase in product sales were the following point of care diagnostic sales increased million  including million in revenue from the irma product line acquired in the fourth quarter of alternate site sales increased million  primarily due to increased sales of the protime product line 
higher vad sales of million 
the majority of this increase came from higher sales of the heartmate vad 
other ancillary product sales  drivers  cannulae  service  rentals and spares increased million  including an increase in tlc ii driver revenue principally from home discharge  which was approved by the fda in the second quarter of  partially offset by million in lower graft product sales 
gross profit gross profit as a percentage of product sales for and was and  respectively 
within these essentially flat margins were the following significant fluctuations a higher margin on cardiovascular products resulting from a shift in sales mix from lower to higher margin products  partially offset by higher manufacturing costs 
a lower margin on point of care revenue  primarily related to the irma product line  plus higher manufacturing and shipping costs associated in part with the shift in sales from distributor to direct channels 

table of contents selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses in were million  or of product sales  compared to million  or of product sales  in the million increase in spending was primarily attributable to the following increased headcount from employees at the end of to at the end of  together with annual salary  fringe benefit and other cost increases of million 
higher spending on marketing and related activities  primarily associated with our hearthope center program  destination therapy  and costs associated with the irma product line of million

amortization of purchased intangible assets amortization of purchased intangible assets in was million compared to million in as there were no new acquisitions in coupled with the million write off of the aria assets at the end of in process research and development costs we had no in process research and development charges in in process research and development expense in was million related to our acquisition of the irma product line 
litigation  restructuring and other costs litigation  restructuring and other charges in were million compared to million in the expense is primarily comprised of costs associated with a putative federal securities law class action  and a shareholder derivative action entitled wong v 
grossman that were filed in the third quarter of the expense is primarily comprised of million to settle a patent infringement claim 
interest expense interest expense in was million compared to none in this expense in includes million in interest payments and million in amortization of the debt issuance costs related to our convertible notes 
we did not have these notes or any other outstanding debt instrument in interest income and other interest income and other in was million compared to million in this increase was primarily due to higher interest income earned on our portfolio based on increased cash balances in compared income taxes our effective tax rate was in compared to in the reduction in our effective tax on a comparative basis was due primarily to a combination of reduced tax basis profitability in  increased interest income from tax favorable investments and increased research and development credits  which were offset in part by increased expenditures for non deductible expenses 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources at december   we had working capital of million compared with million at january  cash and cash equivalents and short term available for sale investments at december  were million compared to million at january  the increase is due primarily to cash generated from operations and proceeds from stock option exercises  offset in part by net purchases of property  plant and equipment and purchases of investment securities

this amount included net income of million and non cash adjustments to net income of million primarily made up of million for depreciation and amortization  million related to tax benefits on stock options  million related to amortization of deferred compensation expenses principally related to ceo transition costs  and million for unrealized costs related to investments and interest and other  partially offset by a million change in the deferred tax liability 
additionally  million was provided by accounts payable and other liabilities  driven by increased accruals for income taxes and compensation related costs  partially offset by an increase in cash used for inventory of million and an increase in accounts receivable of million due primarily to increased sales at the end of the year 
investing activities used million  with million net purchases of investment securities and million to acquire property  plant and equipment  net of million in transfers of product inventory of drivers and demonstration equipment into fixed assets 
the purchases of property  plant and equipment consisted of equipment purchases of million  of which million relates to the cardiovascular segment and million relates to the itc segment 
cash provided by financing activities for year ended december  was million  including million from proceeds related to stock option exercises and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan partially offset by million paid to repurchase million shares of stock under our stock repurchase programs in the first quarter of and million related to restricted stock forfeiture 
in march  we agreed to purchase a new enterprise resource planning software system  or erp system  for our itc segment 
the cost of the purchased software licenses  hardware  implementation costs and consulting for the erp system for the year ended december  was million  with million capitalized 
in september  we agreed to purchase a  square foot office building in pleasanton  california for approximately million  subject to certain adjustments and other expenses at closing 
during the third quarter of we paid a deposit of million 
the remaining amount due  million  was paid at the close of escrow  which occurred in january and was paid for with existing cash 
we believe that cash and cash equivalents  short term available for sale investments on hand and expected cash flows from operations  will be sufficient to fund our operations  capital requirements and stock repurchase programs for at least the next twelve months 
the impact of inflation on our financial position and the results of operations was not significant during any of the periods presented 
off balance sheet arrangements letter of credit in the third quarter of we obtained an irrevocable standby letter of credit for  as part of our workers compensation insurance program 
the letter of credit is not collateralized 
the letter of credit expires on june  and is scheduled to automatically renew each year on june th 
contractual obligations as of december   we had the following contractual obligations in millions total thereafter long term debt obligations a real estate purchase obligation operating lease obligations purchase obligations total 
table of contents our operating lease obligations of million were comprised of our various leased facilities and office equipment 
our purchase obligations of million were comprised of supply agreements in effect at december  the real estate obligation relates to the balance due at december  for the purchase of a  square foot office building in pleasanton  california  which closed in january a includes interest of million and original issue discount of million 
see note to our audited consolidated financial statements in this annual report for data related to long term debt 
accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement r share based payment  an amendment of fasb statements nos 
and this statement requires that stock based compensation be recognized as a cost in the financial statements and that such cost be measured based on the fair value of the stock based compensation 
in april  the securities and exchange commission adopted a rule amendment that delayed the compliance dates for sfas r  and as such  we have adopted this statement on january  we have elected to adopt the modified prospective application transition approach for implementing the provisions of sfas r 
under this method  stock compensation expense will be included in our financial statements as of january   on a prospective basis  without any restatement of prior period expense 
in addition  we will continue to use the black scholes model for the valuation of our stock based awards consistent with our previously reported pro forma results under the original sfas the option life and forfeiture assumptions that we use under sfas r will change as underlying stock option data is refined 
the valuation assumptions  given stock option data refinements  may differ in material respects from those disclosed in the pro forma results under the original sfas disclosed previously in footnote to the consolidated financial statements 
the effects of the adoption of sfas r will result in significant  although non cash  stock based compensation expense which we estimate to be to million for our fiscal year 
in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issues fasb staff position fsp  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
this fsp provides additional guidance on when an investment in a debt or equity security should be considered impaired and when that impairment is deemed other than temporary  even if a decision to sell has not been made 
the fsp also requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other than temporary impairments 
companies are required to apply the guidance in this fsp to reporting periods beginning after december  we adopted this fsp in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our investment portfolio is made up of marketable investments in money market funds  auction rate securities  us treasury securities and debt instruments of government agencies  local municipalities  and high quality corporate issuers 
all investments are carried at market value and are treated as available for sale 
all investments mature within two years or less from the date of purchase  except some of the investments in us treasuries that are held as restricted investments as collateral for future interest payments related to our convertible debt  which mature within three years from the original date of purchase 
our holdings of the securities of any one issuer  except government agencies  do not exceed of the portfolio 
if interest rates rise  the market value of our investments may decline  which could result in a loss if we are forced to sell an investment before its scheduled maturity 
if interest rates were to rise or fall from current levels by basis points  the change in our net unrealized loss on investments would be nominal 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risks 
our convertible notes do not bear interest rate risk as the notes were issued at a fixed rate of interest 
foreign currency rate fluctuations we conduct business in foreign countries 
our international operations consist primarily of sales and service personnel for our ventricular assist products who report to our us sales and marketing group and are internally reported as part of that group 
all assets and liabilities of our non us operations are translated into us dollars at the period end exchange rates and the resulting translation adjustments are included in comprehensive income 
the period end translation of the non functional currency assets and liabilities 
table of contents primarily assets and liabilities on our uk subsidiary s consolidated balance sheet that are not denominated in uk pounds sterling at the period end exchange rates result in foreign currency gains and losses  which are included in interest income and other 
we use forward foreign currency contracts to hedge the gains and losses generated by the revaluation of these non functional currency assets and liabilities 
these derivatives are not designated as cash flow or fair value hedges under sfas no 
as a result  changes in the fair value of the forward foreign currency contracts are included in interest income and other 
the change in the fair value of the forward foreign currency contracts typically offsets the change in value from revaluation of the non functional currency assets and liabilities 
these contracts typically have maturities of three months or less 
at december   we had forward foreign currency contracts in euros with a notional value of million  and at january   we had forward foreign currency contracts in pounds sterling and euros with a notional value at million 
these contracts had an average exchange rate of euros to us dollars of as of december  the impact of foreign currency revaluation  net of forward foreign currency contracts  was a gain of million for the year ended december  and a loss of million for the year ended january
