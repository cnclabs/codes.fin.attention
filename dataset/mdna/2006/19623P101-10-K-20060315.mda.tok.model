the company offers commercial  consumer and mortgage banking services 
application of critical accounting policies and accounting estimates the accounting and reporting policies of the company are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and conform to general practices within the banking industry 
the company s financial position and results of operations are affected by management s application of accounting policies  including judgments made to arrive at the carrying value of assets and liabilities and amounts reported for revenues  expenses and related disclosures 
different assumptions in the application of these policies could result in material changes in the company s financial position and or results of operations 
critical accounting policies are those policies that management believes are the most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results  and they require management to make estimates that are difficult  subjective or complete 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses provides coverage for probable losses inherent in the company s loan portfolio 
management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses quarterly based on changes  if any  in underwriting activities  the loan portfolio composition including product mix and geographic  industry or customer specific concentrations  trends in loan performance  regulatory guidance and economic factors 
this evaluation is inherently subjective  as it requires the use of significant management estimates 
many factors can affect management s estimates of specific and expected losses  including volatility of default probabilities  collateral values  rating migrations  loss severity and economic and political conditions 
the allowance is increased through provisions charged to operating earnings and reduced by net charge offs 

table of contents part ii continued item continued the company determines the amount of the allowance based on relative risk characteristics of the loan portfolio 
the allowance recorded for loans is based on reviews of individual credit relationships and historical loss experience 
the allowance for losses relating to impaired loans is based on the loan s observable market price  the discounted cash flows using the loan s effective interest rate  or the value of collateral for collateral dependent loans 
regardless of the extent of the company s analysis of customer performance  portfolio trends or risk management processes  certain inherent but undetected losses are probable within the loan portfolio 
this is due to several factors  including inherent delays in obtaining information regarding a customer s financial condition or changes in their unique business conditions  the judgmental nature of individual loan evaluations  collateral assessments and the interpretation of economic trends 
volatility of economic or customer specific conditions affecting the identification and estimation of losses for larger nonhomogeneous credits and the sensitivity of assumptions utilized to establish allowances for homogeneous groups of loans are among other factors 
the company estimates a range of inherent losses related to the existence of these exposures 
the estimates are based upon the company s evaluation of risk associated with the commercial and consumer levels and the estimated impact of the current economic environment 
goodwill and other intangibles the company records all assets and liabilities acquired in purchase acquisitions  including goodwill and other intangibles  at fair value as required by sfas no 
goodwill is subject  at a minimum  to annual tests for impairment 
other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives using straight line and accelerated methods  and are subject to impairment if events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to realize the carrying amount 
the initial goodwill and other intangibles recorded and subsequent impairment analysis require management to make subjective judgments concerning estimates of how the acquired asset will perform in the future 
events and factors that may significantly affect the estimates include  among others  customer attrition  changes in revenue growth trends  specific industry conditions and changes in competition 
overview the following discussion and analysis present the more significant factors affecting the company s financial condition as of december  and  and results of operations for each of the years in the three year period ended december  this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements  notes thereto and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report 
all of the acquisitions during the reported periods were accounted for as purchase transactions  and as such  their related results of operations are included from the date of acquisition 
taxable equivalent adjustments are the result of increasing income from tax free loans and investments by an amount equal to the taxes that would be paid if the income were fully taxable based on a percent federal tax rate  thus making tax exempt yields comparable to taxable asset yields 
dollar amounts in tables are stated in thousands  except for per share amounts 

table of contents part ii continued item continued results of operations the company s results of operations are determined by its ability to effectively manage interest income and expense  to minimize loan and investment losses  to generate noninterest income and to control noninterest expense 
since market forces and economic conditions beyond the control of the company determine interest rates  the ability to generate net interest income is dependent upon the company s ability to obtain an adequate spread between the rate earned on earning assets and the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
thus  the key performance for net interest income is the interest margin or net yield  which is taxable equivalent net interest income divided by average earning assets 
net income totaled million  or diluted per common share in compared to million  or diluted per common share in and million  or diluted per common share in selected income statement data  returns on average assets and average equity and dividends per share for the comparable periods were as follows taxable equivalent net interest income taxable equivalent adjustment net interest income provision for possible loan losses noninterest income noninterest expense income before income taxes income taxes net income basic per common share net income diluted per common share net income return on average assets net income return on average equity net income income from operations for increased million  or percent  compared to the increase was primarily the result of a million increase in net interest income and a decrease of million in provision for possible loan losses 
the impact of these items was partly offset by a million increase in noninterest expense  a decrease of million in noninterest income and an increase of million in income tax expense 
income from operations for increased million  or percent  compared to the increase was primarily the result of a million increase in net interest income and a million decrease in provision for loan losses 
the impact of these items was partly offset by a million increase in noninterest expense  a decrease of million in noninterest income and a million increase in income tax expense 

table of contents part ii continued item continued details of the changes in the various components of net income are further discussed below 
net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest income on earning assets  such as loans and securities  and interest expense on liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings  which are used to fund those assets 
net interest income is the company s largest source of revenue  representing percent of total revenue during and percent during net interest margin is the taxable equivalent net interest income as a percentage of average earning assets for the period 
the level of interest rates and the volume and mix of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities impact net interest income and net interest margin 
the federal reserve board influences the general market rates of interest  including the deposit and loan rates offered by many financial institutions 
the company s loan portfolio is significantly affected by changes in the prime interest rate 
the prime interest rate  which is the rate offered on loans to borrowers with strong credit  began at percent and decreased basis points during to end the year at percent 
during  the prime rate decreased basis points to end the year at percent 
during  the prime rate decreased basis points to end the year at percent 
during  the prime rate increased basis points to end the year at percent and during  the prime rate increased basis points to end the year at percent 
the federal funds rate moved similar to prime rate with interest rates of percent  percent  percent  percent and percent  respectively  as of year end    and it is anticipated that future interest rate hikes will occur at least through the first half of the following table presents the changes in taxable equivalent net interest income and identifies the changes due to differences in the average volume of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the changes due to changes in the average interest rate on those assets and liabilities 
the changes in net interest income due to changes in both average volume and average interest rate have been allocated to the average volume change or the average interest rate change in proportion to the absolute amounts of the change in each 
the company s consolidated average balance sheets along with an analysis of taxable equivalent net interest earnings are presented in the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk included elsewhere in this report 

table of contents part ii continued item continued rate volume analysis the rate volume analysis presented hereafter illustrates the change from year to year for each component of the taxable equivalent net interest income separated into the amount generated through volume changes and the amount generated by changes in the yields rates

during each year  there are numerous and simultaneous balance and rate changes  therefore  it is not possible to precisely allocate the changes between balances and rates 
for the purpose of this table  changes that are not exclusively due to balance changes or rate changes have been attributed to rates 

table of contents part ii continued item continued our financial performance is impacted by  among other factors  interest rate risk and credit risk 
we do not utilize derivatives to mitigate our credit risk  relying instead on an extensive loan review process and our allowance for loan losses 
interest rate risk is the change in value due to changes in interest rates 
the company is exposed only to us dollar interest rate changes and accordingly  the company manages exposure by considering the possible changes in the net interest margin 
the company does not have any trading instruments nor does it classify any portion of its investment portfolio as held for trading 
the company does not engage in any hedging activity or utilize any derivatives 
the company has no exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk  commodity price risk and other market risks 
this risk is addressed by our asset liability management committee alco which includes senior management representatives 
the alco monitors interest rate risk by analyzing the potential impact to the net portfolio of equity value and net interest income from potential changes to interest rates and considers the impact of alternative strategies or changes in balance sheet structure 
interest rates play a major part in the net interest income of financial institutions 
the repricing of interest earnings assets and interest bearing liabilities can influence the changes in net interest income 
the timing of repriced assets and liabilities is gap management and our company has established its policy to maintain a gap ratio in the one year time horizon of 
to 
our exposure to interest rate risk is reviewed on at least a semiannual basis by our board of directors and the alco 
interest rate risk exposure is measured using interest rate sensitivity analysis to determine our change in net portfolio value in the event of assumed changes in interest rates 
in order to reduce the exposure to interest rate fluctuations  we have implemented strategies to more closely match our balance sheet composition 
the company has engaged suntrust bank to run a quarterly asset liability model for interest rate risk analysis 
we are generally focusing our investment activities on securities with terms or average lives in the year range 
the company maintains about percent of its loan portfolio in adjustable rate loans that reprice with prime rate changes  while the bulk of its other loans mature within years 
the liabilities to fund assets are primarily in short term certificates of deposit that mature within one year 
this balance sheet composition has allowed the company to be relatively constant with its net interest margin the past several years  though the unprecedented basis point decrease by us federal reserve in  basis point decrease in and basis point decrease in resulted in significant net interest margin pressure 
during  interest rates increased basis points and during interest rates increased basis points 
the shift to increased rates the past two years has resulted in improved and stable net interest margins 
net interest margin remained flat at percent for compared to percent for and improved from percent for we anticipate continued stability in the net interest margin for given the federal reserve s present increased interest rate forecast for the first half of should the federal reserve s stance change to a neutral or flat rate forecast  the company would be challenged with net interest rate compression 

table of contents part ii continued item continued taxable equivalent net interest income for increased million  or percent  compared to  while taxable equivalent net interest income for increased by million  or percent  compared to the fluctuation between the comparable periods resulted from the positive impact of growth in the average volume of earning assets and a positive impact from the increasing average interest rates 
the average volume of earning assets during increased almost million compared to while over the same period the net interest margin remained flat at percent 
similarly  the average volume of earning assets during increased million compared to while over the same period the net interest margin increased basis points from percent to percent 
growth in average earning assets during and was primarily in loans 
the stability in the net interest margin in was primarily the result of increased earning assets and loan deposit pricing by the company 
the average volume of loans increased million in compared to and increased million in compared to the average yield on loans increased basis points in compared to and decreased basis points in compared to funding for this growth was primarily provided by deposit growth 
the average volume of deposits increased million in compared to and increased million in compared to interest bearing deposits made up percent of the growth in average deposits in and percent of the growth in average deposits in accordingly  the ratio of average interest bearing deposits to total average deposits was percent in  percent in and percent in this deposit mix  combined with a general increase in interest rates  had the effect of i increasing the average cost of total deposits by basis points in compared to and reducing the average cost of total deposits by basis points in compared to  and ii mitigating a portion of the impact of increasing yields on earning assets on the company s net interest income 
the company s net interest spread  which represents the difference between the average rate earned on earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities  was percent in compared to percent in and percent in the net interest spread  as well as the net interest margin  will be impacted by future changes in short term and long term interest rate levels  as well as the impact from the competitive environment 
a discussion of the effects of changing interest rates on net interest income is set forth in quantitative and qualitative disclosures about interest rate sensitivity included elsewhere in this report 
provision for possible loan losses the provision for possible loan losses is determined by management as the amount to be added to the allowance for possible loan losses after net charge offs have been deducted to bring the allowance to a level which  in management s best estimate  is necessary to absorb probable losses within the existing loan portfolio 
the provision for possible loan losses totaled million in compared to million in and million in see the section captioned allowance for possible loan losses elsewhere in this discussion for further analysis of the provision for possible loan losses 

table of contents part ii continued item continued noninterest income the components of noninterest income were as follows service charges on deposit accounts other charges  commissions and fees gain on securities transactions other mortgage fee income total noninterest income for decreased thousand  or percent  compared to while total noninterest income for decreased thousand  or percent  compared to reduction in noninterest income over the comparable periods was primarily in mortgage fee income while deposit service charges reflected a slight decrease in compared to growth in noninterest income was primarily in other charges  commissions  fees and other income over the comparable periods 
changes in these items and the other components of noninterest income are discussed in more detail below 
service charges on deposit accounts 
service charges on deposit accounts for decreased thousand  or percent  compared to the decrease was primarily due to a thousand decrease in overdraft fees  which were mostly related to consumer accounts 
service charges on deposit accounts for increased thousand  or percent  compared to the increase was primarily due to a thousand increase in overdraft fees  which was mostly related to consumer accounts 
mortgage fee income 
mortgage fee income for decreased thousand  or percent  compared to the decrease was primarily due to decreased mortgage loan activity during as most home loan borrowers have already refinanced prior to due to historical low interest rates 
the company anticipates some reduction in mortgage fee income during  though not to the extent of the reduction the past two years 
mortgage fee income for decreased million or percent  compared to the decrease was primarily due to decreased mortgage loan activity during as most home loan borrowers have already refinanced prior to due to historical low interest rates 

table of contents part ii continued item continued all other noninterest income

this increase was offset by gains on the sale of sba loans that decreased to thousand for compared to thousand for  or a decrease of thousand 
the aggregate of all other noninterest accounts decreased thousand  or percent  compared to the decrease was primarily due to the decreased gain on the sale of securities as gains realized were thousand compared to thousand during  or a decrease of thousand 
this decrease was offset by atm income in of thousand compared to thousand in  or an increase of thousand and gain on the sale of sba loans in of thousand compared to gains in  or an increase of thousand

these items and the changes in the various components of noninterest expense are discussed in more detail below 
salaries and employee benefits 
salaries and benefits expense for increased million  or percent  compared to the increase is primarily related to increases in head count  merit increase  denovo branching and the acquisition of the flag thomaston office during during  new offices were opened in valdosta and savannah  georgia 
salaries and benefits expense for increased million  or percent  compared to this increase is primarily related to increases in head count  merit increases and denovo branching 
during  loan production offices were opened in savannah and columbus  georgia and new branch offices were opened in tifton and albany  georgia 

table of contents part ii continued item continued occupancy and equipment 
net occupancy expense for increased thousand  or percent  compared to the company experienced increased net occupancy and equipment expense for resulting from two additional offices opened during and the acquisition of the flag thomaston office during the impact of new offices opened and acquired during resulted in higher building maintenance  insurance and utilities cost  higher depreciation on building and equipment and higher lease expense 
net occupancy expense for increased thousand  or percent  compared to the company experienced increased net occupancy and equipment expense for resulting from four additional offices opened during and the acquisition of the flag thomaston office during the impact of new offices resulted in higher building maintenance  insurance and utilities costs  higher depreciation on building and equipment and higher lease expense 
all other noninterest expense 
all other noninterest expense for increased thousand  or percent compared to the increase is primarily due to additional overhead associated with new offices opened that was partly offset by significant changes in noninterest expense as follows loss on sale of other real estate decreased to thousand for compared to thousand for  or a decrease of thousand  other real estate foreclosure and repossession expense decreased to thousand for compared to thousand for  or a decrease of thousand  atm expense increased to thousand for compared to thousand for  or an increase of thousand  legal and professional fees increased to thousand for compared to thousand for  or an increase of thousand  director fees increased to thousand for from thousand for  or an increase of thousand  and stationery and supplies increased to thousand for compared to thousand for  or an increase of thousand

real estate other  which is primarily family residential properties and nonfarm nonresidential properties  made up percent and percent of total loans  real estate construction made up percent and percent  while installment loans to individuals made up percent and percent of total loans at december  and december   respectively 
real estate loans other include both commercial and consumer balances 

table of contents part ii continued item continued loan origination risk management 
in accordance with the company s decentralized banking model  loan decisions are made at the local bank level 
the company utilizes a central credit committee to assist lenders with the decision making and underwriting process of larger loan requests 
due to the diverse economic markets served by the company  evaluation and underwriting criterion may vary slightly by bank 
overall  loans are extended after a review of the borrower s repayment ability  collateral adequacy  and overall credit worthiness 
commercial purpose  commercial real estate  and industrial loans are underwritten similar to other loans throughout the company 
the properties securing the company s commercial real estate portfolio are diverse in terms of type and geographic location 
this diversity helps reduce the company s exposure to adverse economic events that affect any single market or industry 
management monitors and evaluates commercial real estate loans based on collateral  geography  and risk grade criteria 
the company also utilizes information provided by third party agencies to provide additional insight and guidance about economic conditions and trends affecting the markets it serves 
the company extends loans to builders and developers that are secured by nonowner occupied properties 
in such cases  the company reviews the overall economic conditions and trends for each market to determine the desirability of loans to be extended for residential construction and development 
sources of repayment for these types of loans may be pre committed permanent loans from approved long term lenders  sales of developed property or an interim mini perm loan commitment from the company until permanent financing is obtained 
in some cases  loans are extended for residential loan construction for speculative purposes and are based on the perceived present and future demand for housing in a particular market served by the company 
these loans are monitored by on site inspections and are considered to have higher risks than other real estate loans due to their ultimate repayment being sensitive to interest rate changes  general economic conditions and trends  the demand for the properties  and the availability of long term financing 
the company originates consumer loans at the bank level 
due to the diverse economic markets served the company  underwriting criterion may vary slightly by bank 
the company is committed to serving the borrowing needs of all markets served and  in some cases  adjusts certain evaluation methods to meet the overall credit demographics of each market 
consumer loans represent relatively small loan amounts that are spread across many individual borrowers to help minimize risk 
additionally  consumer trends and outlook reports are reviewed by management on a regular basis 
the company maintains an independent loan review department that reviews and validates the credit risk program on a periodic basis 
results of these reviews are presented to management 
the loan review process complements and reinforces the risk identification and assessment decisions made by lenders and credit personnel  as well as the company s policies and procedures 
commercial  financial and agricultural 
commercial  financial and agricultural loans at december  increased percent from december  to million 
the company s commercial and industrial loans are a diverse group of loans to small  medium and large businesses 
the purpose of these loans varies from supporting seasonal working capital needs to term financing of equipment 
while some short term loans may be made on an unsecured basis  most are secured by the assets being financed with collateral margins that are consistent with the company s loan policy guidelines 

table of contents part ii continued item continued industry concentrations 
as of december  and december   there were no concentrations of loans within any single industry in excess of percent of total loans  as segregated by standard industrial classification code sic code 
the sic code is a federally designed standard industrial numbering system used by the company to categorize loans by the borrower s type of business 
collateral concentrations 
lending is concentrated in commercial and real estate loans primarily to local borrowers 
the company has a high concentration of real estate loans  however  these loans are well collateralized and  in management s opinion  do not pose an adverse credit risk 
in addition  the balance of the loan portfolio is sufficiently diversified to avoid significant concentration of credit risk 
although the company has a diversified loan portfolio  a substantial portion of borrower s ability to honor their contracts is dependent upon the viability of the real estate economic sector 
large credit relationships 
colony is currently in eighteen counties in south and central georgia and include metropolitan markets in doughtery  lowndes  houston  chatham and muscogee counties 
as a result  the company originates and maintains large credit relationships with several commercial customers in the ordinary course of business 
the company considers large credit relationships to be those with commitments equal to or in excess of million prior to any portion being sold 
large relationships also include loan participations purchased if the credit relationship with the agent is equal to or in excess of million 
in addition to the company s normal policies and procedures related to the origination of large credits  the company s central credit committee must approve all new and renewed credit facilities which are part of large credit relationships 
the following table provides additional information on the company s large credit relationships outstanding at december  and december  december  december  number of relationships period end balances number of relationships period end balances committed outstanding committed outstanding large credit relationships million and greater million to million maturities and sensitivities of loans to changes in interest rates 
the following table presents the maturity distribution of the company s loans at december  the table also presents the portion of loans that have fixed interest rates or variable interest rates that fluctuate over the life of the loans in accordance with changes in an interest rate index such as the prime rate 
due in one year or less after one  but within three years after three  but within five years after five years total loans with fixed interest rates loans with floating interest rates 
table of contents part ii continued item continued the company may renew loans at maturity when requested by a customer whose financial strength appears to support such renewal or when such renewal appears to be in the company s best interest 
in such instances  the company generally requires payment of accrued interest and may adjust the rate of interest  require a principal reduction or modify other terms of the loan at the time of renewal 
nonperforming assets and potential problem loans year end nonperforming assets and accruing past due loans were as follows loans accounted for on nonaccrual loans past due days or more renegotiated loans other real estate foreclosed total nonperforming assets nonperforming assets as a percentage of total loans and foreclosed assets total assets accruing past due loans days past due or more days past due total accruing past due loans nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans  loans past due days or more  restructured loans and foreclosed real estate 
nonperforming assets at december  increased percent from december  generally  loans are placed on nonaccrual status if principal or interest payments become days past due and or management deems the collectibility of the principal and or interest to be in question  as well as when required by regulatory requirements 
loans to a customer whose financial condition has deteriorated are considered for nonaccrual status whether or not the loan is days or more past due 
for consumer loans  collectibility and loss are generally determined before the loan reaches days past due 
accordingly  losses on consumer loans are recorded at the time they are determined 
consumer loans that are days or more past due are generally either in liquidation payment status or bankruptcy awaiting confirmation of a plan 
once interest accruals are discontinued  accrued but uncollected interest is charged to current year operations 
subsequent receipts on nonaccrual loans are recorded as a reduction of principal  and interest income is recorded only after principal recovery is reasonably assured 
classification of a loan as nonaccrual does not preclude the ultimate collection of loan principal or interest 
renegotiated loans are loans on which  due to deterioration in the borrower s financial condition  the original terms have been modified in favor of the borrower or either principal or interest has been forgiven 

table of contents part ii continued item continued foreclosed assets represent property acquired as the result of borrower defaults on loans 
foreclosed assets are recorded at estimated fair value  less estimated selling costs  at the time of foreclosure 
write downs occurring at foreclosure are charged against the allowance for possible loan losses 
on an ongoing basis  properties are appraised as required by market indications and applicable regulations 
write downs are provided for subsequent declines in value and are included in other noninterest expense along with other expenses related to maintaining the properties 
allowance for possible loan losses the allowance for possible loan losses is a reserve established through a provision for possible loan losses charged to expense  which represents management s best estimate of probable losses that have been incurred within the existing portfolio of loans 
the allowance  in the judgment of management  is necessary to reserve for estimated loan losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio 
the allowance for possible loan losses includes allowance allocations calculated in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  as amended by sfas no 
 and allowance allocations determined in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
the level of the allowance reflects management s continuing evaluation of industry concentrations  specific credit risks  loan loss experience  current loan portfolio quality  present economic  political and regulatory conditions and unidentified losses inherent in the current loan portfolio 
portions of the allowance may be allocated for specific credits  however  the entire allowance is available for any credit that  in management s judgment  should be charged off 
while management utilizes its best judgment and information available  the ultimate adequacy of the allowance is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond the company s control  including the performance of the company s loan portfolio  the economy  changes in interest rates and the view of the regulatory authorities toward loan classifications 
the company s allowance for possible loan losses consists of specific valuation allowances established for probable losses on specific loans and historical valuation allowances for other loans with similar risk characteristics 
the allowances established for probable losses on specific loans are based on a regular analysis and evaluation of classified loans 
loans are classified based on an internal credit risk grading process that evaluates  among other things i the obligor s ability to repay  ii the underlying collateral  if any  and iii the economic environment and industry in which the borrower operates 
this analysis is performed at the subsidiary bank level and is reviewed at the parent company level 
once a loan is classified  it is reviewed to determine whether the loan is impaired and  if impaired  a portion of the allowance for possible loan losses is specifically allocated to the loan 
specific valuation allowances are determined after considering the borrower s financial condition  collateral deficiencies  and economic conditions affecting the borrower s industry  among other things 
historical valuation allowances are calculated from loss factors applied to loans with similar risk characteristics 
the loss factors are based on loss ratios for groups of loans with similar risk characteristics 
the loss ratios are derived from the proportional relationship between actual loan losses and the total population of loans in the risk category 
the historical loss ratios are periodically updated based on actual charge off experience 
the company s groups of similar loans include similarly risk graded groups of loans not reviewed for individual impairment 

table of contents part ii continued item continued management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for each of these components on a quarterly basis 
peer comparisons  industry comparisons  and regulatory guidelines are also used in the determination of the general valuation allowance 
loans identified as losses by management  internal loan review  and or bank examiners are charged off 
an allocation for loan losses has been made according to the respective amounts deemed necessary to provide for the possibility of incurred losses within the various loan categories 
the allocation is based primarily on previous charge off experience adjusted for changes in experience among each category 
additional amounts are allocated by evaluating the loss potential of individual loans that management has considered impaired 
the reserve for loan loss allocation is subjective since it is based on judgment and estimates  and therefore is not necessarily indicative of the specific amounts or loan categories in which the charge offs may ultimately occur 
the following table shows a comparison of the allocation of the reserve for loan losses for the periods indicated 
reserve reserve reserve reserve reserve commercial  financial and agricultural real estate construction real estate farmland real estate other loans to individuals all other loans loan balance in each category expressed as a percentage of total end of period loans 
activity in the allowance for loan losses is presented in the following table

table of contents part ii continued item continued the allowance for possible loan losses is maintained at a level considered appropriate by management  based on estimated probable losses within the existing loan portfolio 
the allowance  in the judgment of management  is necessary to reserve for estimated loan losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio 
the provision for possible loan losses reflects loan quality trends  including the level of net charge offs or recoveries  among other factors 
the provision for possible loan losses decreased million from million in to million in flat provisions were made during due to the overall general improvement in the loan portfolio 
nonperforming assets as a percentage of total loans and foreclosed assets improved to percent at december  compared to percent a year ago 
during  the provision for possible loan losses decreased million from the million recorded in the provision for possible loan losses was lower in primarily due to charge offs that included one large commercial loan 
net charge offs in increased thousand compared to while net charge offs in decreased thousand compared to the general increase in net charge offs during is reflective of the more stringent credit standards 
management believes the level of the allowance for possible loan losses was adequate as of december  should any of the factors considered by management in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for possible loan losses change  the company s estimate of probable loan losses could also change  which could affect the level of future provisions for possible loan losses

the company has percent of its portfolio classified as available for sale 
at december   there were no holdings of any one issuer  other than the us government and its agencies  in an amount greater than percent of the company s stockholders equity 
the average yield of the securities portfolio was percent in compared to percent in and percent in the slight decrease in the average yield from to primarily resulted from recognized amortization on mortgage backed securities due to paydowns received during the increase in the average yield from to primarily resulted from investment of new funds at higher rates due to federal reserve s basis point interest rate hike during the last half of the early repayment of mortgage backed securities primarily resulted from borrower refinancing due to lower market interest rates 
the overall growth in the securities portfolio over the comparable periods was primarily funded by deposit growth

with the current interest rate environment  it appears that many customers are more inclined to invest their funds for extended periods and are choosing to maintain such funds in time accounts 
off balance sheet arrangements  commitments  guarantees and contractual obligations the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations and other commitments to make future payments as of december  payments for borrowings do not include interest 
payments related to leases are based on actual payments specified in the underlying contracts 
loan commitments and standby letters of credit are presented at contractual amounts  however  since many of these commitments are expected to expire unused or only partially used  the total amounts of these commitments do not necessarily reflect future cash requirements 
payments due by period year or less more than year but less than years years or more but less than years years or more total contractual obligations subordinated debentures other borrowed money federal home loan bank advances operating leases deposits with stated maturity dates other commitments loan commitments standby letters of credit performance letters of credit construction contracts total contractual obligations and other commitments in the ordinary course of business  the banks have entered into off balance sheet financial instruments which are not reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
these instruments include commitments to extend credit  standby letters of credit  performance letters of credit  guarantees and liability for assets held in trust 
such financial instruments are recorded in the financial statements when funds are disbursed or the instruments become payable 
the company uses the same credit policies for these off balance sheet financial instruments as they do for instruments that are recorded in the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents part ii continued item continued loan commitments 
the company enters into contractual commitments to extend credit  normally with fixed expiration dates or termination clauses  at specified rates and for specific purposes 
substantially all of the company s commitments to extend credit are contingent upon customers maintaining specific credit standards at the time of loan funding 
the company minimizes its exposure to loss under these commitments by subjecting them to credit approval and monitoring procedures 
management assesses the credit risk associated with certain commitments to extend credit in determining the level of the allowance for possible loan losses 
loan commitments outstanding at december  are included in the preceding table 
standby and performance letters of credit 
letters of credit are written conditional commitments issued by the company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
in the event the customer does not perform in accordance with the terms of the agreement with the third party  the company would be required to fund the commitment 
the maximum potential amount of future payments the company could be required to make is represented by the contractual amount of the commitment 
if the commitment is funded  the company would be entitled to seek recovery from the customer 
the company s policies generally require that standby and performance letters of credit arrangements contain security and debt covenants similar to those contained in loan agreements 
standby and performance letters of credit outstanding at december  are included in the preceding table 
capital and liquidity at december   stockholders equity totaled million compared to million at december  in addition to net income of million  other significant changes in stockholders equity during included million of dividends paid and an increase of thousand resulting from the stock grant plan 
the accumulated other comprehensive income component of stockholders equity totaled  thousand at december  compared to thousand at december  this fluctuation was mostly related to the after tax effect of changes in the fair value of securities available for sale 
under regulatory requirements  the unrealized gain or loss on securities available for sale does not increase or reduce regulatory capital and is not included in the calculation of risk based capital and leverage ratios 
regulatory agencies for banks and bank holding companies utilize capital guidelines designed to measure tier and total capital and take into consideration the risk inherent in both on balance sheet and off balance sheet items 
tier capital consists of common stock and qualifying preferred stockholders equity less goodwill 
tier capital consists of certain convertible  subordinated and other qualifying debt and the allowance for loan losses up to percent of risk weighted assets 
the company has no tier capital other than the allowance for loan losses and gain on marketable equity securities 
using the capital requirements presently in effect  the tier ratio as of december  was percent and total tier and risk based capital was percent 
both of these measures compare favorably with the regulatory minimum of percent for tier and percent for total risk based capital 
the company s tier leverage ratio as of december  was percent  which exceeds the required ratio standard of percent 
for  average capital was million  representing percent of average assets for the year 
this compares to percent for 
table of contents part ii continued item continued the company paid a quarterly dividend of   and per common share during the first  second  third and fourth quarters of  respectively  and quarterly dividends of   and per common share during the first  second  third and fourth quarters of  respectively 
this equates to a dividend payout ratio of percent in and percent in the company  primarily through the actions of its subsidiary banks  engages in liquidity management to ensure adequate cash flow for deposit withdrawals  credit commitments and repayments of borrowed funds 
needs are met through loan repayments  net interest and fee income and the sale or maturity of existing assets 
in addition  liquidity is continuously provided through the acquisition of new deposits  the renewal of maturing deposits and external borrowings 
management monitors deposit flow and evaluates alternate pricing structures to retain and grow deposits 
to the extent needed to fund loan demand  traditional local deposit funding sources are supplemented by the use of fhlb borrowings  brokered deposits and other wholesale deposit sources outside the immediate market area 
internal policies have been updated to monitor the use of various core and noncore funding sources  and to balance ready access with risk and cost 
through various asset liability management strategies  a balance is maintained among goals of liquidity  safety and earnings potential 
internal policies that are consistent with regulatory liquidity guidelines are monitored and enforced by the banks 
the investment portfolio provides a ready means to raise cash if liquidity needs arise 
as of december   the company held million in bonds excluding fhlb stock  at current market value in the available for sale portfolio 
at december   the available for sale bond portfolio totaled million 
only marketable investment grade bonds are purchased 
although most of the banks bond portfolios are encumbered as pledges to secure various public funds deposits  repurchase agreements  and for other purposes  management can restructure and free up investment securities for a sale if required to meet liquidity needs 
management continually monitors the relationship of loans to deposits as it primarily determines the company s liquidity posture 
colony had ratios of loans to deposits of percent as of december  and percent at december  management employs alternative funding sources when deposit balances will not meet loan demands 
the ratios of loans to all funding sources excluding subordinated debentures at december  and december  were percent and percent  respectively 
management continues to emphasize programs to generate local core deposits as our company s primary funding sources 
the stability of the banks core deposit base is an important factor in colony s liquidity position 
a heavy percentage of the deposit base is comprised of accounts of individuals and small businesses with comprehensive banking relationships and limited volatility 
at december  and december   the banks had million and million in certificates of deposit of  or more 
these larger deposits represented percent and percent of respective total deposits 
management seeks to monitor and control the use of these larger certificates  which tend to be more volatile in nature  to ensure an adequate supply of funds as needed 
relative interest costs to attract local core relationships are compared to market rates of interest on various external deposit sources to help minimize the company s overall cost of funds 

table of contents part ii continued item continued local market deposit sources proved insufficient to fund the strong loan growth trends at colony over the past several years 
the company supplemented deposit sources with brokered deposits 
as of december   the company had million  or percent of total deposits  in brokered certificates of deposit attracted by external third parties 
additionally  the banks use external wholesale or internet services to obtain out of market certificates of deposit at competitive interest rates when funding is needed 
to plan for contingent sources of funding not satisfied by both local and out of market deposit balances  colony and its subsidiaries have established multiple borrowing sources to augment their funds management 
the company has borrowing capacity through membership of the federal home loan bank program 
the banks have also established overnight borrowing for federal funds purchased through various correspondent banks 
management believes the various funding sources discussed above are adequate to meet the company s liquidity needs in the future without any material adverse impact on operating results 
liquidity measures the ability to meet current and future cash flow needs as they become due 
the liquidity of a financial institution reflects its ability to meet loan requests  to accommodate possible outflows in deposits and to take advantage of interest rate market opportunities 
the ability of a financial institution to meet its current financial obligations is a function of balance sheet structure  the ability to liquidate assets  and the availability of alternative sources of funds 
the company seeks to ensure its funding needs are met by maintaining a level of liquid funds through asset liability management 
asset liquidity is provided by liquid assets which are readily marketable or pledgeable or which will mature in the near future 
liquid assets include cash  interest bearing deposits in banks  securities available for sale  maturities and cash flow from securities held to maturity  and federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements 
liability liquidity is provided by access to funding sources which include core deposits 
should the need arise  the company also maintains relationships with the federal home loan bank and several correspondent banks that can provide funds on short notice 
since colony is a bank holding company and does not conduct operations  its primary sources of liquidity are dividends up streamed from subsidiary banks and borrowings from outside sources 
the liquidity position of the company is continuously monitored and adjustments are made to the balance between sources and uses of funds as deemed appropriate 
management is not aware of any events that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity  capital resources or operations 
in addition  management is not aware of any regulatory recommendations regarding liquidity  which if implemented  would have a material adverse effect on the company 

table of contents part ii continued item continued impact of inflation and changing prices the company s financial statements included herein have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
gaap presently requires the company to measure financial position and operating results primarily in terms of historic dollars 
changes in the relative value of money due to inflation or recession are generally not considered 
the primary effect of inflation on the operations of the company is reflected in increased operating costs 
in management s opinion  changes in interest rates affect the financial condition of a financial institution to a far greater degree than changes in the inflation rate 
while interest rates are greatly influenced by changes in the inflation rate  they do not necessarily change at the same rate or in the same magnitude as the inflation rate 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond the control of the company  including changes in the expected rate of inflation  the influence of general and local economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the united states government  its agencies and various other governmental regulatory authorities  among other things  as further discussed in the next section 
regulatory and economic policies the company s business and earnings are affected by general and local economic conditions and by the monetary and fiscal policies of the united states government  its agencies and various other governmental regulatory authorities  among other things 
the federal reserve board regulates the supply of money in order to influence general economic conditions 
among the instruments of monetary policy available to the federal reserve board are i conducting open market operations in united states government obligations  ii changing the discount rate on financial institution borrowings  iii imposing or changing reserve requirements against financial institution deposits  and iv restricting certain borrowings and imposing or changing reserve requirements against certain borrowing by financial institutions and their affiliates 
these methods are used in varying degrees and combinations to affect directly the availability of bank loans and deposits  as well as the interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits 
for that reason alone  the policies of the federal reserve board have a material effect on the earnings of the company 
governmental policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future  however  the company cannot accurately predict the nature  timing or extent of any effect such policies may have on its future business and earnings

table of contents part ii continued item continued colony bankcorp  inc and subsidiaries interest rate sensitivity the following table is an analysis of the company s interest rate sensitivity position at december  the interest bearing rate sensitivity gap  which is the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities by repricing period  is based upon maturity or first repricing opportunity  along with a cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap 
it is important to note that the table indicates a position at a specific point in time and may not be reflective of positions at other times during the year or in subsequent periods 
major changes in the gap position can be  and are  made promptly as market outlooks change 
assets and liabilities repricing within in thousands months or less to months year to years over years total earning assets interest bearing deposits federal funds sold investment securities loans  net of unearned income other interest bearing assets total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities interest bearing demand deposits savings time deposits other borrowings subordinated debentures total interest bearing liabilities interest rate sensitivity gap cumulative interest sensitivity gap interest rate sensitivity gap as a percentage of interest earning assets cumulative interest rate sensitivity as a percentage of interest earning as assets interest bearing demand and savings accounts for repricing purposes are considered to reprice within months or less 
short term borrowings for repricing purposes are considered to reprice within months or less 

table of contents part ii continued item continued the foregoing table indicates that we had a one year negative gap of million  or percent of total assets at december  in theory  this would indicate that at december   million more in liabilities than assets would reprice if there were a change in interest rates over the next days 
thus  if interest rates were to decline  the gap would indicate a resulting increase in net interest margin 
however  changes in the mix of earning assets or supporting liabilities can either increase or decrease the net interest margin without affecting interest rate sensitivity 
in addition  the interest rate spread between an asset and our supporting liability can vary significantly while the timing of repricing of both the assets and our supporting liability can remain the same  thus impacting net interest income 
this characteristic is referred to as a basis risk and  generally  relates to the repricing characteristics of short term funding sources such as certificates of deposits 
gap analysis has certain limitations 
measuring the volume of repricing or maturing assets and liabilities does not always measure the full impact on the portfolio value of equity or net interest income 
gap analysis does not account for rate caps on products  dynamic changes such as increasing prepay speeds as interest rates decrease  basis risk  or the benefit of nonrate funding sources 
the majority of our loan portfolio reprices quickly and completely following changes in market rates  while nonterm deposit rates in general move slowly and usually incorporate only a fraction of the change in rates 
products categorized as nonrate sensitive  such as our noninterest bearing demand deposits  in the gap analysis behave like long term fixed rate funding sources 
both of these factors tend to make our actual behavior more asset sensitive that is indicated in the gap analysis 
in fact  we experience higher net interest income when rates rise  opposite what is indicated by the gap analysis 
in fact  during the recent period of declines in interest rates  our net interest margin has declined 
therefore  management uses gap analysis  net interest margin analysis and market value of portfolio equity as our primary interest rate risk management tools
