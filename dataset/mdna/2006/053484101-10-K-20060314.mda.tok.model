item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we are primarily engaged in developing  acquiring  owning and operating apartment communities in high barrier to entry markets of the united states 
we seek to create long term shareholder value by accessing capital on cost effective terms  deploying that capital to develop  redevelop and acquire apartment communities in high barrier to entry markets  operating apartment communities  and selling communities when they no longer meet our long term investment strategy and when pricing is attractive 
the net operating income of our current operating communities  as defined later in this report  is one of the financial measures that we use to evaluate community performance 
net operating income is affected by the demand and supply dynamics within our markets  our rental rates and occupancy levels  and our ability to control operating costs 
our overall financial performance is also impacted by the general availability and cost of capital and the performance of our newly developed and acquired apartment communities 
this report  including the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations  contains forward looking statements regarding future events or trends as described more fully under forward looking statements on page of this report 
actual results or developments could differ materially from those projected in such statements as a result of the risk factors described in item a  risk factors  of this report 
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this report 
business description and community information overview we believe that apartment communities present an attractive long term investment opportunity compared to other real estate investments because a broad potential resident base should help reduce demand volatility over a real estate cycle 
we intend to continue to pursue real estate investments in markets where constraints to new supply exist  and where new rental household formations are expected to out pace multifamily permit activity over the course of the real estate cycle 
barriers to entry in our markets generally include a difficult and lengthy entitlement process with local jurisdictions and dense urban or suburban areas where zoned and entitled land is in limited supply 
we regularly evaluate the allocation of our investments by the amount of invested capital and by product type within our individual markets  which are located in the northeast  mid atlantic  midwest  pacific northwest  and northern and southern california regions of the united states 
our strategy is to more deeply penetrate these markets with a broad range of products and services and an intense focus on our customer 
a substantial majority of our communities are upscale  which generally command among the highest rents in their markets 
however  we also pursue the ownership and operation of apartment communities that target a variety of customer segments and price points  consistent with our goal of offering a broad range of products and services 
we believe that  over an entire real estate cycle  lower housing affordability and the limited new supply of apartment homes in our markets will result in a higher propensity to rent and larger increases in cash flow relative to other markets 
however  throughout the real estate cycle  apartment market fundamentals  and therefore operating cash flows  are affected by overall economic conditions 
a number of our markets experienced economic contraction due to job losses in and  particularly in the technology  telecom and financial services sectors 
this resulted in a prolonged period of weak apartment market fundamentals as reflected in declining rental rates and demand 
however  was a year of transition  where the economy showed signs of an early phase recovery  as evidenced by modest job growth and declining unemployment claims 
the improvement in the economic environment in has resulted in stronger apartment market fundamentals 
this is supported by the following operating results achieved within our established community portfolio during we achieved year over year revenue growth  we transitioned from occupancy gains to increases in rental rates as the primary driver of rental revenue growth  we achieved the highest year over year increase in average rental rates in four years  and average economic occupancy was at or above in each of our markets 
based on these results and our expectations for improving demand supply fundamentals  we expect continued growth in the revenue and net operating income generated by our operating communities in we expect continued job growth and household formation in our markets in  the principal drivers of housing demand 
condominium conversion activity has reduced the availability of rental apartments  while low single family home affordability makes rental apartments an economically attractive housing alternative 
accordingly  we expect apartment market fundamentals to continue to improve in our markets such that apartment rental demand will outpace new supply  resulting in rental revenue growth of to in our established community portfolio in  and projected noi growth of to 
in positioning for future growth  we increased our development volume 
we currently have in excess of  under construction measured by total projected capitalized cost of the communities at completion  including the portions owned by joint venture partners 
in addition  we continue to secure new development rights  as discussed below  including the acquisition of land for future development 
we currently have development rights for construction of new apartment communities that  based on total projected capitalized cost  total approximately  we anticipate starting new developments with total projected capitalized costs of  to  in these total projected capitalized costs may be impacted by increasing construction costs  particularly in the areas of payroll  utilities  concrete and steel 
we also anticipate acquiring additional land held for future development for an aggregate purchase price of  to  we continue to look for opportunities to acquire existing communities through our investment in and management of a discretionary investment fund the fund 
during its investment period which will end on or before march   the fund will be our exclusive vehicle for acquiring apartment communities  subject to certain exceptions 
the fund acquired four communities for an aggregate purchase price of  during and has approximately  under contract for acquisition in early we will continue to focus on acquisition opportunities where we believe we can create value  generally through redevelopment or repositioning opportunities 
strong capital flows to the industry and the strength of the condominium market have resulted in an attractive selling environment 
we sold seven communities during for an aggregate sales price of approximately  of which approximately  was sold to condominium converters 
we anticipate asset sales of approximately  to  in while the active condominium market has created demand for multifamily apartment communities  it has also created a challenging environment for us in other ways such as increased competition for land  resulting in  at times  the acquisition of land zoned for uses other than residential with the potential for rezoning  increased competition for subcontractors  increased competition for experienced multifamily development and construction professionals  particularly in our markets  increased competition for our customers  resulting in increased move outs due to home ownership  and increased risks as a result of sales to condominium converters 
there are indications that condominium conversion activity is slowing  which could impact the market for our assets held for sale  and as a result  the volume of assets we offer for sale 
our real estate investments consist primarily of current operating apartment communities  communities in various stages of development development communities and development rights ie  land or land options held for development  as further described in item of this report 
our current operating communities are further distinguished as established communities  other stabilized communities  lease up communities and redevelopment communities 
established communities are generally operating communities that are consolidated for financial reporting purposes and were owned and had stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the prior year  which allows the performance of these communities and the markets in which they are located to be compared and monitored between years 
other stabilized communities are generally all other operating communities that have stabilized occupancy and operating expenses as of the beginning of the current year  but had not achieved stabilization as of the beginning of the prior year 
lease up communities consist of communities where construction is complete but stabilization has not been achieved 
redevelopment communities consist of communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is planned to begin during the current year 
a more detailed description of our reportable segments and other related operating information can be found in note  segment reporting  of our consolidated financial statements 
although each of these categories is important to our business  we generally evaluate overall operating  industry and market trends based on the operating results of established communities  for which a detailed discussion can be found in results of operations as part of our discussion of overall operating results 
we evaluate our current and future cash needs and future operating potential based on acquisition  disposition  development  redevelopment and financing activities within other stabilized  redevelopment and development communities  for which detailed discussions can be found in liquidity and capital resources 
as of december   we owned or held an ownership interest in apartment communities containing  apartment homes in ten states and the district of columbia  of which communities were under construction and two communities were under reconstruction 
in addition  we owned a direct or indirect ownership interest in development rights to develop an additional communities that  if developed in the manner expected  will contain an estimated  apartment homes 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies  including making estimates and assumptions 
if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different  or different estimates or assumptions had been made  it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied  resulting in different financial results or a different presentation of our financial statements 
below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical to an understanding of our financial condition and operating results and that may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters which are inherently uncertain 
as a reit that owns  operates and develops apartment communities  our critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition  cost capitalization  asset impairment evaluation and reit status 
a discussion of our significant accounting policies  including further discussion of the accounting policies described below  can be found in note  organization and significant accounting policies of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition rental income related to leases is recognized on an accrual basis when due from residents in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for leases 
in accordance with our standard lease terms  rental payments are generally due on a monthly basis 
any cash concessions given at the inception of the lease are amortized over the approximate life of the lease  which is generally one year 
a discussion regarding the impact of cash concessions on rental revenue for established communities can be found in results of operations 
cost capitalization we capitalize costs during the development of assets including interest and related loan fees  property taxes and other direct and indirect costs beginning when development efforts commence until the asset  or a portion of the asset  is delivered and is ready for its intended use  which is generally indicated by the issuance of a certificate of occupancy 
we capitalize costs during redevelopment of apartment homes including interest and related loan fees  property taxes and other direct and indirect costs beginning when an apartment home is taken out of service for redevelopment until the apartment home redevelopment is completed and the apartment home is available for a new resident 
rental income and operating expenses incurred during the initial lease up or post redevelopment lease up period are fully recognized as they accrue 
we capitalize pre development costs incurred in pursuit of development rights for which we currently believe future development is probable 
these costs include legal fees  design fees and related overhead costs 
future development of these development rights is dependent upon various factors  including zoning and regulatory approval  rental market conditions  construction costs and availability of capital 
pre development costs incurred in the pursuit of development rights for which future development is not yet considered probable are expensed as incurred 
in addition  if the status of a development right changes  making future development no longer probable  any capitalized pre development costs are written off with a charge to expense 
we generally capitalize only non recurring expenditures 
we capitalize improvements and upgrades only if the item i exceeds  ii extends the useful life of the asset  and iii is not related to making an apartment home ready for the next resident 
under this policy  virtually all capitalized costs are non recurring  as recurring make ready costs are expensed as incurred 
recurring make ready costs include i carpet and appliance replacements  ii floor coverings  iii interior painting  and iv other redecorating costs 
because we expense recurring make ready costs  such as carpet replacements  our expense levels and volatility are greatest in the third quarter of each year as this is when we experience our greatest amount of turnover 
we capitalize purchases of personal property  such as computers and furniture  only if the item is a new addition and the item exceeds  we generally expense replacements of personal property 
in  and  the amounts capitalized excluding land costs related to acquisitions  development and redevelopment were   and  respectively 
for established and other stabilized communities  we recorded non revenue generating capital expenditures of  or per apartment home in   or per apartment home in and  or per apartment home in in addition  revenue generating capital expenditures  such as water submetering equipment and cable installations  were   and  in  and  respectively 
the average maintenance costs charged to expense per apartment home  including carpet and appliance replacements  related to these communities was  in   in and  in historically  we have experienced a gradual increase in capitalized costs and expensed maintenance costs per apartment home as the average age of our communities has increased  and expensed maintenance costs have fluctuated with turnover 
although we expect these trends to continue in the future  capitalized costs increased in over prior year growth levels as we embarked on a number of community upgrades and improvements 
we expect capitalized costs in to be at or slightly above levels as we continue with these community upgrades and improvements 
asset impairment evaluation if there is an event or change in circumstance that indicates an impairment in the value of a community  our policy is to assess the impairment by making a comparison of the current and projected operating cash flow of the community over its remaining useful life  on an undiscounted basis  to the carrying amount of the community 
if the carrying amount is in excess of the estimated projected operating cash flow of the community  we would recognize an impairment loss equivalent to an amount required to adjust the carrying amount to its estimated fair market value 
real estate assets held for sale are measured at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value less the cost to sell 
we account for our investments in unconsolidated entities that were created prior to and have not been modified since june   and are not variable interest entities in accordance with statement of position  accounting for investments in real estate ventures and accounting principles board opinion no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock 
any investments in entities that were created or modified subsequent to june   and are not variable interest entities are accounted for in accordance with eitf issue no 
 determining whether a general partner  or the general partners as a group  controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights 
if there is an event or change in circumstance that indicates a loss in the value of an investment  we record the loss and reduce the value of the investment to its fair value 
a loss in value would be indicated if we could not recover the carrying value of the investment or if the investee could not sustain an earnings capacity that would justify the carrying amount of the investment 
reit status we are a maryland corporation that has elected to be treated  for federal income tax purposes  as a reit 
we elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of  as amended  for the year ended december  and have not revoked such election 
a corporate reit is a legal entity which holds real estate interests and must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements  including a requirement that it currently distribute at least of its adjusted taxable income to stockholders 
as a reit  we generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income tax on taxable income we distribute currently to our stockholders 
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  we will be subject to federal income taxes at regular corporate rates subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax and may not be able to elect to qualify as a reit for four subsequent taxable years 
results of operations our year over year operating performance is primarily affected by changes in net operating income of our current operating apartment communities due to market conditions  net operating income derived from acquisitions and development completions  the loss of net operating income related to disposed communities  and capital market  disposition and financing activity 
a comparison of our operating results for the years  and follows dollars in thousands change change change change revenue rental and other income management  development and other fees total revenue expenses direct property operating expenses  excluding property taxes property taxes total community operating expenses corporate level property management and other indirect operating expenses investments and investment management interest expense  net depreciation expense general and administrative expense total other expenses equity in income of unconsolidated entities  n a venture partner interest in profit sharing minority interest in consolidated partnerships income from continuing operations before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle discontinued operations income from discontinued operations gain on sale of real estate assets total discontinued operations income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle cumulative effect of change in accounting principle net income dividends attributable to preferred stock net income available to common stockholders net income available to common stockholders increased  or  to  in this increase is primarily attributable to higher gains on sales of assets in  including the gain related to the sale of a technology investment  as well as increased net operating income from established communities and newly developed communities 
net income available to common stockholders decreased  or  to  in this decrease is primarily attributable to lower gains on sales in as compared to  including the gain realized from an unconsolidated entity  and increased depreciation expense  partially offset by increased net operating income from newly developed and acquired communities 
net operating income noi is considered by management to be an important and appropriate supplemental performance measure to net income because it helps both investors and management to understand the core operations of a community or communities prior to the allocation of any corporate level or financing related costs 
noi reflects the operating performance of a community and allows for an easy comparison of the operating performance of individual assets or groups of assets 
in addition  because prospective buyers of real estate have different financing and overhead structures  with varying marginal impacts to overhead by acquiring real estate  noi is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of a real estate asset or group of assets 
we define noi as total property revenue less direct property operating expenses  including property taxes  and noi excludes corporate level income including management  development and other fees  corporate level property management and other indirect operating expenses  investments and investment management costs  interest expense  net  general and administrative expense  equity in income of unconsolidated entities  minority interest in consolidated partnerships  venture partner interest in profit sharing  depreciation expense  gain on sale of real estate assets  cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  and income from discontinued operations 
noi does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap 
therefore  noi should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance 
noi should also not be considered an alternative to net cash flow from operating activities  as determined by gaap  as a measure of liquidity  nor is noi necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs 
a calculation of noi for the years ended december   and  along with a reconciliation to net income for each year  is as follows dollars in thousands for the year ended net income corporate level property management and other indirect operating expenses corporate level other income investments and investment management interest expense  net general and administrative expense equity in income of unconsolidated entities minority interest in consolidated partnerships venture partner interest in profit sharing depreciation expense cumulative effect of change in accounting principle gain on sale of real estate assets income from discontinued operations net operating income the noi increases of  and  in and  respectively  as compared to the prior years  consist of changes in the following categories dollars in thousands increase increase decrease established communities other stabilized communities development and redevelopment communities total for purposes of this table  amounts have been restated from amounts previously reported for changes in discontinued operations as described in note  discontinued operations real estate assets sold or held for sale  of our consolidated financial statements 
the noi increase in established communities in was largely due to the improved apartment market fundamentals 
we maintained average economic occupancy of at least in all regions during the year ended december  and we experienced the first year over year increase in rental rates in three years 
we reached a transition point in the components of rental revenue growth  shifting from occupancy gains to increases in rental rates 
we will continue to seek increases in rental rates by increasing market rents and or reducing concessions  and we expect revenue growth from our established communities of to in as compared to in addition  although we will continue to aggressively manage operating expenses  there is upward pressure on operating expenses from increasing utility  labor and property tax expenses 
we expect operating expenses at our established communities to increase by to in as compared to overall  we anticipate growth in noi from our established communities of to in as compared to the company has given projected noi growth in only for established communities and not on a company wide basis 
the company believes that noi growth of the established communities assists investors in understanding management s estimate of the likely contribution to operations from established communities 
however  the company has not provided a projection of noi growth on a company wide basis due to the difficulty in projecting the timing of new development starts  dispositions and acquisitions  as well as the complexities involved in projecting the allocation of corporate level property management overhead  general and administrative costs and interest expense to communities not yet developed  disposed or acquired 
noi growth expected from established communities is not a projection of the company s projected consolidated financial performance or projected cash flow 
rental and other income increased in due to increased rental rates and occupancy for our established communities  coupled with additional rental income generated from newly developed communities 
rental and other income increased in due to rental income generated from newly developed and acquired communities  as well as increased occupancy for our established communities  partially offset by declines in effective rental rates for our established communities 
we expect apartment fundamentals to continue to strengthen in overall portfolio the weighted average number of occupied apartment homes increased to  apartment homes for as compared to  apartment homes for and  apartment homes for this change is primarily the result of an increase in the overall occupancy rate and increased homes available from newly developed and acquired communities  partially offset by communities sold in and the weighted average monthly revenue per occupied apartment home increased to  in as compared to  in and  in established communities rental revenue increased  or  in and decreased  or  in the increase in is due to both increased rental rates and increased economic occupancy as compared to the decrease in is due to declining rental rates  partially offset by increased economic occupancy as compared to for  the weighted average monthly revenue per occupied apartment home increased to  compared to  in  primarily due to increased market rents and decreased concessions 
the average economic occupancy increased from in to in economic occupancy takes into account the fact that apartment homes of different sizes and locations within a community have different economic impacts on a community s gross revenue 
economic occupancy is defined as gross potential revenue less vacancy loss  as a percentage of gross potential revenue 
gross potential revenue is determined by valuing occupied homes at leased rates and vacant homes at market rents 
we expect rental revenue from established communities to increase to in as compared to we experienced increases in established communities rental revenue in all six of our regions in as compared to the largest increases in rental revenue were in southern california  the pacific northwest and the northeast  with increases of  and  respectively  between years 
the northeast and northern california regions comprise the majority of our established community revenue  and therefore are discussed in more detail below 
the northeast region represented approximately of established community rental revenue during average rental rates increased to  in and economic occupancy increased during we expect job growth to improve in the northeast in  although at a more moderate rate than our other markets 
we expect moderate rental rate growth in the northeast during  with northern new jersey leading the region in revenue growth 
we expect boston  massachusetts to lag the region in revenue growth  as economic recovery is not occurring as quickly as in other areas of the region 
northern california  which represented approximately in established community rental revenue during  experienced an increase in rental revenue of in as compared to average rental rates increased by to  in  and economic occupancy increased to in although apartment fundamentals have been weak in certain areas of northern california  particularly in san jose  california  was a transition point for the region 
we expect northern california to see continued improvement in apartment fundamentals  driven by accelerating job growth and reduced product in the rental market due to condominium conversion activity 
we expect the improving fundamentals to translate into accelerated revenue growth 
in accordance with gaap  cash concessions are amortized as an offset to rental revenue over the approximate lease term  which is generally one year 
as a supplemental measure  we also present rental revenue with concessions stated on a cash basis to help investors evaluate the impact of both current and historical concessions on gaap based rental revenue and to more readily enable comparisons to revenue as reported by other companies 
rental revenue with concessions stated on a cash basis also allows investors to understand historical trends in cash concessions  as well as current rental market conditions 
the following table reconciles total rental revenue in conformity with gaap to total rental revenue adjusted to state concessions on a cash basis for our established communities for the years ended december  and dollars in thousands 
information for the year ended december  is not presented  as established community classification is not applicable prior to january  see note  segment reporting  of our consolidated financial statements 
for the year ended rental revenue gaap basis concessions amortized concessions granted rental revenue adjusted to state concessions on a cash basis year over year change gaap revenue n a year over year change cash concession based revenue n a management  development and other fees increased in as compared to due to increased asset management  property management and redevelopment fees earned from the fund  which was formed in march in addition  construction and development fees earned from one of our unconsolidated entities in contributed to increased fee income 
we expect fee income to increase in as compared to due to a full year of operations of  and an increased number of assets owned by  the fund 
direct property operating expenses  excluding property taxes increased in both and  primarily due to the addition of recently developed and acquired apartment homes 
for established communities  direct property operating expenses  excluding property taxes  increased  or  to  in due primarily to increases in payroll and utility costs  partially offset by decreases in marketing and bad debt expenses 
during  operating expenses increased  or  due primarily to increased payroll costs  as well as increased make ready costs associated with increasing occupancy 
we expect operating expenses for established communities to increase by to in as compared to  primarily as a result of continued higher utility expenses and payroll costs 
operating expense growth in as compared to will be tempered due to  of expenses incurred in for land lease payments that will not be incurred in due to the exercise of a purchase option 
property taxes increased in both and due to overall higher assessments and the addition of newly developed and redeveloped apartment homes  and are impacted by the size and timing of successful tax appeals in both years 
for established communities  property taxes increased in and by  and  respectively  due to overall higher assessments throughout all regions  and are impacted by the size and timing of successful tax appeals in both years 
we expect property taxes to continue to increase in as compared to as local jurisdictions are expected to continue to seek additional revenue sources to offset budget deficits 
however  property taxes may fluctuate due to the timing and size of successful tax appeals 
we evaluate property tax increases internally  as well as engage third party consultants  and appeal increases when appropriate 
corporate level property management and other indirect operating expenses increased in as compared to due to increased compensation costs  as well as increased costs relating to corporate initiatives  including investments in technology and training 
we expect corporate level property management and other indirect operating expenses to increase in as compared to as compensation costs continue to increase 
investments and investment management reflects the costs incurred related to investment acquisitions  investment management and abandoned pursuit costs  which include the abandonment or impairment of development pursuits  acquisition pursuits  disposition pursuits and technology investments 
investments and investment management increased in as compared to due primarily to increased costs incurred in forming and managing the fund  partially offset by a decrease in abandoned pursuit costs 
investments and investment management increased in as compared to due to the costs incurred in preparing for and forming the fund  increased compensation costs and increased abandoned pursuit costs 
we expect investments and investment management costs to increase in as compared to as fund activity increases 
abandoned pursuit costs were   and  in  and  respectively 
abandoned pursuit costs can be volatile  and the costs incurred in any given period may be widely different in future years 
interest expense  net decreased in as compared to primarily due to the repayment of unsecured debt and a partial reissuance at lower interest rates  as well as higher levels of capitalized interest  in connection with our increased development activity  partially offset by overall higher short term interest rates and higher average outstanding balances on our unsecured credit facility 
interest expense  net increased in as compared to primarily due to the interest income related to a participating mortgage note included in interest expense  net in as described more fully below  partially offset by the repayment of unsecured debt and reissuance at lower interest rates  overall lower interest rates and lower average outstanding balances on our unsecured credit facility 
we expect interest expense  net to decrease during primarily due to higher levels of capitalized interest resulting from increased development activity  as well as lower average outstanding balances on our unsecured credit facility 
depreciation expense increased in both and primarily due to the completion of development and redevelopment activities 
general and administrative expense g a increased in as compared to as a result of i separation costs of approximately  due to the departure of a senior executive  ii the accrual of costs related to various litigation matters of approximately  iii increased board of director fees due to the acceleration of equity awards with the resignation of a director due to disability  and iv higher compensation costs 
g a increased in as compared to as a result of higher compensation costs  increased litigation and settlement costs associated with certain community and corporate matters  and additional corporate governance costs  including costs relating to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of we expect expensed overhead costs  including g a  corporate level property management and investments and investment management  to increase from to in as compared to equity in income of unconsolidated entities increased in primarily due to the gain recognized in the amount of  related to the sale of our investment in rent 
com to ebay 
equity in income of unconsolidated entities decreased in as compared to primarily due to our share of the gain received on a community sold in which was accounted for under the equity method 
venture partner interest in profit sharing in and represented the income allocated to our venture partner in a profit sharing arrangement as discussed in note  investments in unconsolidated entities  of our consolidated financial statements 
effective december  we no longer account for our interest in this venture as a profit sharing arrangement  and therefore during  no income or loss from venture partner interest in profit sharing was recognized 
minority interest in consolidated partnerships increased in and decreased in due to the consolidation of an entity under fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
 as revised in december effective january   we consolidated an entity from which we held a participating mortgage note due to the implementation of fin as discussed in note  organization and significant accounting policies  of our consolidated financial statements 
we did not hold an equity interest in this entity  and therefore of the entity s net loss was recognized as minority interest in consolidated partnerships during the year ended december  in october  we received payment in full of the outstanding mortgage note due from this entity 
upon repayment of the mortgage note  our economic interest in this entity ended  and therefore this entity was no longer considered a variable interest entity under fin and we discontinued consolidation 
income from discontinued operations represents the net income generated by communities sold during the period from january  through december  or considered held for sale as of december  see note  discontinued operations real estate assets sold or held for sale of our consolidated financial statements for additional information 
the decreases in and are due to the sale of seven communities and one office building in and five communities in  eliminating the income generated from these assets upon disposition 
gain on sale of real estate assets increased in and decreased in due to the volume and size of dispositions in each year 
the amount of gains realized depends on many factors  including the number of communities sold  the size and carrying value of those communities and local market conditions 
we expect to continue to sell communities based on overall portfolio allocation needs as well as to respond to market opportunities 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in is a result of the implementation of fin  discussed above  and represents the difference between the net assets consolidated under fin and the previously recorded net assets 
dividends attributable to preferred stock decreased during primarily as a result of several preferred stock redemptions during funds from operations attributable to common stockholders ffo ffo is considered by management to be an appropriate supplemental measure of our operating and financial performance because  by excluding gains or losses related to dispositions of previously depreciated property and excluding real estate depreciation  which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates  ffo can help one compare the operating performance of a real estate company between periods or as compared to different companies 
we believe that in order to understand our operating results  ffo should be examined with net income as presented in our consolidated financial statements 
for a more detailed discussion and presentation of ffo  see selected financial data  included in item of this report 
liquidity and capital resources factors affecting our liquidity and capital resources are our cash flows from operations  financing activities and investing activities 
operating cash flow has historically been determined by i the number of apartment homes currently owned  ii rental rates  iii occupancy levels and iv operating expenses with respect to apartment homes 
the timing  source and amount of cash flow provided by financing activities and used in investing activities are sensitive to the capital markets environment  particularly to changes in interest rates 
the timing and type of capital markets activity in which we engage  as well as our plans for development  redevelopment  acquisition and disposition activity  are affected by changes in the capital markets environment  such as changes in interest rates or the availability of cost effective capital 
we regularly review our liquidity needs  the adequacy of cash flow from operations  and other expected liquidity sources to meet these needs 
we believe our principal short term liquidity needs are to fund normal recurring operating expenses  debt service and maturity payments  preferred stock dividends and downreit partnership unit distributions  the minimum dividend payments required to maintain our reit qualification under the internal revenue code of  development and redevelopment activity in which we are currently engaged  and capital calls for the fund as required 
we anticipate that we can fully satisfy these needs from a combination of cash flow provided by operating activities  proceeds from asset dispositions and borrowing capacity under our variable rate unsecured credit facility 
cash and cash equivalents totaled  at december   an increase of  from  at december  the following discussion relates to changes in cash due to operating  investing and financing activities  which are presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows included elsewhere in this report 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities increased to  in from  in  primarily due to additional noi from our established community operations  as well as noi from recently developed communities  partially offset by the loss of noi from the communities sold in and  as discussed earlier in this report 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities of  in related to investments in assets through development  redevelopment and acquisition of apartment communities  including the acquisition of a partner interest in a real estate joint venture  substantially all of which is offset by proceeds from asset dispositions  including the proceeds from the sale of a technology investment 
during  we invested  in the purchase and development of real estate and capital expenditures we began the development of new communities 
these communities  if developed as expected  will contain a total of  apartment homes  and the total capitalized cost  including land acquisition costs  is projected to be approximately  we completed the development  of seven communities containing an aggregate of  apartment homes for a total capitalized cost  including land acquisition cost  of we completed the redevelopment of three communities containing  apartment homes for a total capitalized cost of  of which  was incurred prior to redevelopment  we acquired the equity interest of a third party partner in a joint venture owning one community for a net purchase price of  we contributed  for a equity interest in the fund  which upon contribution owned four apartment communities containing a total of apartment homes with an aggregate gross real estate value of  we also received net proceeds of  as reimbursement for acquiring and warehousing these communities 
in december  we contributed an additional  to the fund  bringing our total equity investment in the fund to approximately  we acquired parcels of land in connection with development rights  for an aggregate purchase price of  and we had capital expenditures relating to current communities real estate assets of  and non real estate capital expenditures of financing activities net cash used in financing activities totaled  in  consisting primarily of dividends paid  certain unsecured note repayments and mortgage note repayments  partially offset by the issuance of common stock for option exercises  the issuance of unsecured notes and mortgage notes payable including draws on construction loans and an increase in borrowings under our unsecured credit facility 
see note  notes payable  unsecured notes and credit facility  and note  stockholders equity  of our consolidated financial statements  for additional information 
variable rate unsecured credit facility we have a  revolving variable rate unsecured credit facility with jpmorgan chase bank and wachovia bank  na serving as banks and syndication agents for a syndicate of commercial banks and bank of america  serving as bank and administrative agent 
under the terms of the credit facility  we may elect to increase the facility by up to an additional  provided that one or more banks from the syndicate or otherwise voluntarily agree to provide the additional commitment 
no member of the syndicate of banks can prohibit such increase  such an increase in the facility will only be effective to the extent banks from the syndicate or otherwise choose to commit to lend additional funds 
we pay participating banks  in the aggregate  an annual facility fee of approximately  the unsecured credit facility bears interest at varying levels based on the london interbank offered rate libor  rating levels achieved on our unsecured notes and on a maturity schedule selected by us 
the current stated pricing is libor plus per annum on january  
the spread over libor can vary from libor plus to libor plus based upon the rating of our long term unsecured debt 
in addition  a competitive bid option is available for borrowings of up to  this option allows banks that are part of the lender consortium to bid to provide us loans at a rate that is lower than the stated pricing provided by the unsecured credit facility 
the competitive bid option may result in lower pricing if market conditions allow 
we had no outstanding balance under this competitive bid option at january  we are subject to i certain customary covenants under the unsecured credit facility  including  but not limited to  maintaining certain maximum leverage ratios  a minimum fixed charges coverage ratio and minimum unencumbered assets and equity levels  and ii prohibitions on paying dividends in amounts that exceed of our ffo  except as may be required to maintain our reit status 
the credit facility matures in may  assuming our exercise of a one year renewal option 
at january    was outstanding   was used to provide letters of credit and  was available for borrowing under the unsecured credit facility 
future financing and capital needs debt maturities one of our principal long term liquidity needs is the repayment of long term debt at the time that such debt matures 
for unsecured notes  we anticipate that no significant portion of the principal of these notes will be repaid prior to maturity 
if we do not have funds on hand sufficient to repay our indebtedness as it becomes due  it will be necessary for us to refinance the debt 
this refinancing may be accomplished by uncollateralized private or public debt offerings  additional debt financing that is collateralized by mortgages on individual communities or groups of communities  draws on our unsecured credit facility or by additional equity offerings 
although we believe we will have the capacity to meet our long term liquidity needs  we cannot assure you that additional debt financing or debt or equity offerings will be available or  if available  that they will be on terms we consider satisfactory 
the following debt activity occurred during the year ended december  we repaid  in previously issued unsecured notes in january  along with any unpaid interest  pursuant to their scheduled maturity 
no prepayment penalty was incurred  we issued  in unsecured notes in march under our existing shelf registration statement at an annual effective interest rate of 
interest on these notes is payable semi annually on march and september  and they mature in march  in connection with the admission of outside investors into the fund  we deconsolidated the assets and liabilities of four communities owned by the fund  including  in fixed rate mortgage debt secured by two of the communities  we made a payment in the amount of  to the third party lender of a joint venture entity that was unconsolidated at december  but was consolidated in march upon acquisition of the equity interest of the third party partner  and we assumed  in fixed rate debt in connection with the acquisition of a parcel of improved land 
we currently have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the securities and exchange commission 
the shelf registration statement originally provided for the issuance of  of debt and equity in one or more public offerings  however  only  remains available for issuance 
we expect to increase our debt and equity capacity in early however  we cannot assure you that market conditions will permit us to issue debt or equity securities on cost effective terms or that the registration statement will remain available and effective at all times

financed by variable rate  tax exempt debt  but the interest rate on a portion of this debt is effectively fixed at december  and through a swap agreement 
the portion of the debt fixed through a swap agreement decreases and therefore the variable portion of the debt increases monthly as payments are made to a principal reserve fund 
variable rates are given as of december  financed by variable rate debt  but interest rate is capped through an interest rate protection agreement

this community was deconsolidated in march upon the admission of outside investors into the fund 
future financing and capital needs portfolio and other activity as of december   we had new communities under construction  for which a total estimated cost of  remained to be invested 
in addition  we had two communities under reconstruction  for which a total estimated cost of  remained to be invested 
substantially all of the capital expenditures necessary to complete the communities currently under construction and reconstruction  as well as development costs related to pursuing development rights  will be funded from the remaining capacity under our current  unsecured credit facility  the net proceeds from sales of existing communities  retained operating cash  the issuance of debt or equity securities  and or private equity funding 
before planned reconstruction activity  including reconstruction activity related to the fund as discussed below  or the construction of a development right begins  we intend to arrange adequate financing to complete these undertakings  although we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing 
in the event that financing cannot be obtained  we may have to abandon development rights  write off associated pre development costs that were capitalized and or forego reconstruction activity 
in such instances  we will not realize the increased revenues and earnings that we expected from such development rights or reconstruction activity and significant losses could be incurred 
we have invested in the fund  a private  discretionary investment vehicle that will acquire and operate apartment communities in our markets 
the fund will serve  until march  or until of its committed capital is invested  as the exclusive vehicle through which we will acquire apartment communities  subject to certain exceptions 
these exceptions include significant individual asset and portfolio acquisitions  properties acquired in tax deferred transactions and acquisitions that are inadvisable or inappropriate for the fund  if any 
the fund will not restrict our development activities  and will terminate after a term of eight years  subject to two one year extensions 
the fund has nine institutional investors  including us  with combined capital commitments of  a significant portion of the investments made in the fund by its investors are being made through avalonbay value added fund  inc  a maryland corporation that will qualify as a reit under the internal revenue code the fund reit 
a wholly owned subsidiary of the company is the general partner of the fund and has committed  to the fund and the fund reit of which approximately  has been invested as of january  representing a combined general partner and limited partner equity interest 
under the fund documents  the fund has the ability to employ leverage through debt financings up to on a portfolio basis  which  if achieved  would enable the fund to invest up to  from time to time we use joint ventures to hold or develop individual real estate assets 
we generally employ joint ventures primarily to mitigate asset concentration or market risk and secondarily as a source of liquidity 
we may also use joint ventures related to mixed use land development opportunities where our partners bring development and operational expertise to the venture 
each joint venture or partnership agreement has been and will continue to be individually negotiated  and our ability to operate and or dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture or partnership agreement 
however  we can not assure you that we will achieve our objectives through joint ventures 
in evaluating our allocation of capital within our markets  we sell assets that do not meet our long term investment criteria or when capital and real estate markets allow us to realize a portion of the value created over the past business cycle and redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop and redevelop communities 
in response to real estate and capital markets conditions  including strong institutional demand for real estate assets in our markets and demand from condominium converters  we sold seven communities with net proceeds in the aggregate of  in  and expect to sell communities at an aggregate sales price of  to  in we cannot assure you that assets can continue to be sold on terms that we consider satisfactory or that market conditions will continue to make the sale of assets an appealing strategy 
because the proceeds from the sale of communities may not be immediately redeployed into revenue generating assets  the immediate effect of a sale of a community for a gain is to increase net income  but reduce future total revenues  total expenses  noi and ffo 
as of january   we have one community classified as held for sale under gaap 
we are actively pursuing the disposition of this community and expect to close on this disposition within the next twelve months 
however  we cannot assure you that this community will be sold as planned 
off balance sheet arrangements we own interests in unconsolidated real estate entities  with ownership interests up to 
four of these unconsolidated real estate entities  avalon terrace  llc  cvp i  llc  mission bay venture partners  llc and the fund  have debt outstanding as of december  as follows 
additional discussion of these entities can be found in note  investments in unconsolidated entities  of our consolidated financial statements located elsewhere in this report 
avalon terrace  llc has  of fixed rate debt which matures in november and is payable by the unconsolidated real estate entity with operating cash flow from the underlying real estate 
we have not guaranteed the debt on avalon terrace  llc  nor do we have any obligation to fund this debt should the unconsolidated real estate entity be unable to do so 
cvp i  llc has outstanding bonds in the amount of  which mature in february  assuming exercise of two one year renewal options  and are payable by the unconsolidated real estate entity 
in connection with the general contractor services that we provided to cvp i  llc  the entity that owns and developed avalon chrystie place i  we have provided a construction completion guarantee to the lender in order to fulfill their standard financing requirements related to the bond financing 
our obligations under this guarantee will terminate once all of the lender s standard completion requirements have been satisfied 
we currently expect this to occur in early mission bay venture partners  llc has a construction loan in the amount of  of which  is outstanding as of december   which matures in september  assuming exercise of two one year renewal options  and is payable by the unconsolidated real estate entity 
in connection with the general contractor services that we provide to mission bay venture partners  llc  the entity that owns and is developing avalon mission bay north ii  we have provided a construction completion guarantee to the lender in order to fulfill their standard financing requirements related to the construction financing 
our obligations under this guarantee will terminate following construction completion once all of the lender s standard completion requirements have been satisfied 
we currently expect this to occur in the fund has six mortgage loans with amounts outstanding of      and  which mature in october  april  july  august  february but can be prepaid after february without penalty and october  respectively 
these mortgage loans are secured by the underlying real estate 
in addition  the fund has a credit facility with  outstanding as of december   which matures in january the mortgage loans and the credit facility are payable by the fund with operating cash flow from the underlying real estate  and the credit facility is secured by capital commitments 
we have not guaranteed the debt of the fund  nor do we have any obligation to fund this debt should the fund be unable to do so 
in addition  as part of the formation of the fund  we have provided to one of the limited partners a guarantee 
the guarantee provides that  if  upon final liquidation of the fund  the total amount of all distributions to that partner during the life of the fund whether from operating cash flow or property sales does not equal the total capital contributions made by that partner  then we will pay the partner an amount equal to the shortfall  but in no event more than of the total capital contributions made by the partner maximum of approximately  as of december  
we have not recorded a liability related to this guarantee as of december   as the fair value of the real estate assets owned by the fund is considered adequate to cover such payment under a liquidation scenario 
there are no other lines of credit  side agreements  financial guarantees or any other derivative financial instruments related to or between us and our unconsolidated real estate entities 
in evaluating our capital structure and overall leverage  management takes into consideration our proportionate share of this unconsolidated debt 
contractual obligations we currently have contractual obligations consisting primarily of long term debt obligations and lease obligations for certain land parcels and regional and administrative office space 
scheduled contractual obligations required for the next five years and thereafter are as follows as of december  dollars in thousands payments due by period less than more than total year years years years long term debt obligations operating lease obligations total includes  outstanding under our variable rate unsecured credit facility as of december  the table of contractual obligations assumes repayment of this amount in see liquidity and capital resources 
amounts exclude interest payable as of december  includes land leases expiring between july and march amounts do not include any adjustment for purchase options available under the land leases 
inflation and deflation substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term of one year or less 
in an inflationary environment  this may allow us to realize increased rents upon renewal of existing leases or the beginning of new leases 
short term leases generally minimize our risk from the adverse effects of inflation  although these leases generally permit residents to leave at the end of the lease term and therefore expose us to the effect of a decline in market rents 
in a deflationary rent environment  we may be exposed to declining rents more quickly under these shorter term leases

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain financial market risks  the most predominant being fluctuations in interest rates 
we monitor interest rate fluctuations as an integral part of our overall risk management program  which recognizes the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effect on our results of operations 
the effect of interest rate fluctuations historically has been small relative to other factors affecting operating results  such as rental rates and occupancy 
the specific market risks and the potential impact on our operating results are described below 
our operating results are affected by changes in interest rates as a result of borrowings under our variable rate unsecured credit facility as well as outstanding bonds with variable interest rates 
we had  and  in variable rate debt outstanding excluding variable rate debt effectively fixed through swap agreements as of december  and  respectively 
if interest rates on the variable rate debt had been basis points higher throughout and  our annual interest costs would have increased by approximately  and  respectively  based on balances outstanding during the applicable years 
we currently use interest rate protection agreements consisting of interest rate swap and cap agreements to reduce the impact of interest rate fluctuations on certain variable rate indebtedness 
under swap agreements we agree to pay to a counterparty the interest that would have been incurred on a fixed principal amount at a fixed interest rate generally  the interest rate on a particular treasury bond on the date the agreement is entered into  plus a fixed increment  and the counterparty agrees to pay to us the interest that would have been incurred on the same principal amount at an assumed floating interest rate tied to a particular market index 
as of december   the effect of swap agreements is to fix the interest rate on approximately  of our variable rate  tax exempt debt 
the interest rate protection provided by certain swap agreements on the consolidated variable rate  tax exempt debt was not electively entered into by us but  rather  was a requirement of either the bond issuer or the credit enhancement provider related to certain of our tax exempt bond financings 
because the counterparties providing the swap agreements are major financial institutions which have an a or better credit rating by the standard poor s ratings group and the interest rates fixed by the swap agreements are significantly higher than current market rates for such agreements  we do not believe there is exposure at this time to a default by a counterparty provider 
had these swap agreements not been in place during and  our annual interest costs would have been approximately  and  lower  respectively  based on balances outstanding and reported interest rates during the applicable years 
additionally  if the variable interest rates on this debt had been basis points higher throughout and and these swap agreements had not been in place  our annual interest costs would have been approximately  and  lower  respectively 
in addition  changes in interest rates affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt  which impacts the fair value of our aggregate indebtedness 
debt securities and notes payable excluding our variable rate unsecured credit facility with an aggregate carrying value of  at december  had an estimated aggregate fair value of  at december  fixed rate debt excluding variable rate debt effectively fixed through swap agreements represented  of the carrying value and  of the fair value at december  if interest rates had been basis points higher as of december   the fair value of this fixed rate debt would have decreased by
