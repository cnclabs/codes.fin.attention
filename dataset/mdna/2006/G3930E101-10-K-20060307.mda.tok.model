item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we are an offshore oil and gas drilling contractor  owning or operating a fleet of marine drilling rigs 
our fleet includes cantilevered jackup rigs  semisubmersibles and three drillships and two additional semisubmersible rigs we operate for third parties under a joint venture agreement 
included in these fleet numbers are four jackup rigs and one semisubmersible rig that are currently not capable of performing drilling operations due to damage arising as a result of hurricanes katrina and rita 
the semisubmersible rig and two of the jackup rigs are currently undergoing remediations while the damage to the other two jackup rigs is currently being assessed and one or both of these rigs may be declared constructive total losses see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations involuntary conversion of long lived assets and related recoveries 
until a declaration can be made  both jackup rigs are unable to be contracted and they have been excluded for purposes of our utilization calculations 
we also have a contract for the construction of an additional ultra deepwater semisubmersible  to be named the gsf development driller iii  and construction is expected to commence in the first quarter of we provide offshore oil and gas contract drilling services to the oil and gas industry worldwide on a daily rate dayrate basis 
we also provide oil and gas drilling management services on either a dayrate or completed project  fixed price turnkey basis  as well as drilling engineering and drilling project management services  and we participate in oil and gas exploration and production activities  principally in order to facilitate the acquisition of turnkey contracts for our drilling management services operations 
we derive substantially all of our revenues from our contract drilling and drilling management services operations  which depend on the level of drilling activity in offshore oil and natural gas exploration and development markets worldwide 
these operations are subject to a number of risks  many of which are outside our control 
for a discussion of these risks  see item a 
risk factors 
on may   we completed the sale of our land drilling business to precision drilling corporation for a total sales price of million in an all cash transaction 
our land drilling fleet consisted of rigs  of which were located in kuwait  eight in venezuela  four in saudi arabia  four in egypt and three in oman 
operating results for our land drilling operations had historically been included in contract drilling results 
as a result of this sale  however  results of land drilling operations have been excluded from contract drilling results and are reflected in income from discontinued operations  net of tax effect in the consolidated statements of income for the year ended and for further information regarding our land drilling operations  see operating results sale of land drilling fleet discontinued operations 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are impacted by the accounting policies used and the estimates and assumptions made by management during their preparation 
these estimates and assumptions used in connection with some of these policies affect the carrying values of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the amounts of revenues and expenses recognized during the period 
actual results could differ from such estimates and assumptions 
we consider our accounting estimates to be critical in areas where both the nature of the estimates and assumptions used are material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change  and the impact of the estimates and assumptions is material to our operating results or financial condition 
following is a discussion of our critical accounting estimates in the areas of pension costs  properties and depreciation  impairment  income taxes and turnkey drilling costs 
pension costs our pension costs and liabilities are actuarially determined based on certain assumptions including expected long term rates of return on plan assets  rate of increase in future compensation levels and the discount rate used to compute future benefit obligations 
actual results could differ materially from these actuarially determined amounts 

table of contents we use a december measurement date for our pension plans 
the following assumptions were used to determine our pension benefit obligations december  december  us plans us plans us plans us plans discount rate rate of compensation increase the following weighted average assumptions were used to determine our net periodic pension cost year ended december  us plans us plans us plans us plans us plans uk plans discount rate expected long term rate of return rate of compensation increase the discount rates used to calculate the net present value of future benefit obligations at december  and  and pension costs for the years ended december   and  for both our us and us plans are based on the average of current rates earned on long term bonds that receive a moody s rating of aa or better 
we employ third party consultants for our us plans who use a portfolio return model to assess the initial reasonableness of the assumption on expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
using asset class return  variance  and correlation assumptions  the model produces both the expected return and the distribution of possible returns at every fifth percentile for the chosen portfolio 
return assumptions developed by these consultants are forward looking gross returns and are not developed solely by an examination of historical returns 
the building block approach used by the portfolio return model begins with the current us treasury yield curve  recognizing that expected returns on bonds are heavily influenced by the current level of yields 
the model then adds corporate bond spreads and equity risk premiums based on current market conditions  to develop the return expectations for each asset class based on the investment mix for our pension plans 
the volatility and correlation assumptions are also forward looking 
they take into account historical relationships  but are adjusted by our consultants to reflect expected capital market trends 
we also employ third party consultants for our uk plans who assess the reasonableness of the assumption on expected long term rate of return on plan assets based on surveys of various uk plans with similar asset allocations and investment targets 
this assumption on expected long term rate of return on plan assets is compared to various projections of long term rates of returns compiled by both uk governmental agencies and banks 
following is a summary of how changes in the assumed discount rate and expected return on assets  assuming all other factors remain unchanged  would affect the net periodic pension and postretirement benefit expense for and related pension and postretirement benefit obligations as of december  discount rate return on plan assets in millions net periodic pension cost us plans uk plans accumulated benefit obligation us plans n a n a uk plans n a n a projected benefit obligation us plans n a n a uk plans n a n a 
table of contents as of december   we had an unrecognized actuarial loss totaling million for our us and us plans 
this loss will be recognized in net periodic pension cost over the estimated remaining service lives of the active participants in the plans 
approximately million of this loss is expected to be recognized in the calculation of our other postretirement benefits costs and liabilities includes the weighted average annual assumed rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered medical benefits 
this assumption is based on data available to management at the time the assumption is made 
actual results could differ materially from estimated amounts 
for further discussion of the components of our net periodic pension cost and funded status of our pension plans  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
properties and depreciation rigs and drilling equipment 
capitalized costs of rigs and drilling equipment include all costs incurred in the acquisition of capital assets including allocations of interest costs incurred during periods that assets are under construction and while they are being readied for their initial contract 
expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred 
costs of property sold or retired and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts  resulting gains or losses are included in income 
depreciation and amortization 
we depreciate our rigs and equipment over their remaining estimated useful lives 
our estimates of these remaining useful lives may be affected by such factors as changing market conditions  technological advances in the industry or changes in regulations governing the industry  among other things 
we rely primarily on external sources of information as well as our own internal market data in assessing the impact of these factors on estimates of remaining useful lives 
estimates of remaining useful lives are also impacted by mechanical and structural factors 
we review engineering data  operating history  maintenance history and third party inspections to assess useful lives from a structural and mechanical perspective 
in determining estimated salvage values  we look primarily to external sources of information as well as our own internal data regarding the values of scrap metal and salvaged equipment 
changes in any of the assumptions made in estimating remaining useful lives and salvage values of our properties and equipment could result not only in increases or decreases in annual depreciation expense  but also could impact our criteria for analyzing properties and equipment for impairment 
we periodically evaluate the remaining useful lives and salvage values of our rigs  giving effect to operating and market conditions and upgrades performed on these rigs 
as a result of recent analyses performed on our drilling fleet  effective january   we increased the remaining lives on certain rigs in our jackup fleet to years from a range of to years  increased salvage values of these and other rigs in our jackup fleet from million per rig to amounts ranging from to million per rig  and increased the salvage values of our semisubmersibles and certain of our drillships from million per rig to amounts ranging from to million per rig 
the effect of these changes in estimates was a reduction to depreciation expense for the year ended december   of approximately million 
impairment of rigs and drilling equipment 
we review our long term assets for impairment when changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
 among other things  requires that long lived assets and certain intangibles to be held and used be reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value and establishes criteria to determine when a long lived asset is classified as available for sale 
assets to be disposed of and assets not expected to provide any future service potential are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
we did not incur any impairment charges in we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million in the first quarter of related to the sale of the platform rig rig for a nominal sum in connection with our exit from the platform rig business 
we did not incur any impairment charges in 
table of contents our determination of impairment of rigs and drilling equipment  if any  requires estimates of undiscounted future cash flows 
actual impairment charges  if any  are recorded using an estimate of discounted future cash flows 
the determination of future cash flows related to our rigs and drilling equipment requires us to estimate dayrates and utilization in future periods  and such estimates can change based on market conditions  technological advances in the industry or changes in regulations governing the industry 
significant changes to the assumptions underlying our current estimates of cash flows could require a provision for impairment in a future period 
income taxes we are a cayman islands company and we operate through our various subsidiaries in numerous countries throughout the world including the united states 
consequently  our tax provision is based upon the tax laws and rates in effect in the countries in which our operations are conducted and income is earned 
the income tax rates imposed and methods of computing taxable income in these jurisdictions vary substantially 
our effective tax rate for financial statement purposes will continue to fluctuate from year to year as our operations are conducted in different taxing jurisdictions 
current income tax expense represents either liabilities expected to be reflected on our income tax returns for the current year  nonresident withholding taxes  or changes in prior year tax estimates which may result from tax audit adjustments 
our deferred tax expense or benefit represents the change in the balance of deferred tax assets or liabilities as reported on the balance sheet 
valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in order to determine the amount of deferred tax assets and liabilities  as well as of valuation allowances  we must make estimates and assumptions regarding future taxable income  where rigs will be deployed and other matters 
changes in these estimates and assumptions  as well as changes in tax laws  could require us to adjust the deferred tax assets and liabilities or valuation allowances  including as discussed below 
our ability to realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets requires that we achieve certain future earnings levels prior to the expiration of our nol carryforwards 
we have established a valuation allowance against the future tax benefit of a portion of our nol carryforwards and could be required to record an additional valuation allowance if market conditions deteriorate and future earnings are below  or are projected to be below  our current estimates 
as of december   million of a million us nol was expected to expire unutilized at the end of as a result  we carried a million valuation allowance against the expiring nol 
over the course of  us taxable income increased significantly as compared to the estimate to the extent that only million of the expiring nol was unutilized at the end of the year 
as a consequence  million of the us valuation allowance was released which resulted in a million us tax benefit in as of december  all of the remaining valuation allowance relates to foreign nol carryforwards 
in august hurricane katrina damaged four of our semisubmersible rigs in the us gulf of mexico  and in late september hurricane rita caused damage to four jackup rigs in the us gulf of mexico 
as a result of the damage  we recorded  a million involuntary conversion loss offset by million in insurance recoveries 
the impact on us taxable income consists of the net million loss  which represented the hull and machinery deductible  and the million we recorded in the fourth quarter related to expected recoveries from insurers under our loss of hire insurance policy  as discussed in management s discussion and analysis involuntary conversion of long lived assets and related recoveries 
the net tax impact of the million hull and machinery deductible and the expected million insurance recoveries under our loss of hire insurance is million  all of which is included in the million estimated negative impact of the hurricanes on our results 
in november the drillship glomar robert 
f 
bauer was sold resulting in a gain for financial accounting purposes of million  which was not subject to income taxes in any jurisdiction 

table of contents in december  we completed a subsidiary realignment to separate our us and foreign holding company structures 
this realignment included the redemption of a minority interest in a foreign subsidiary held by one of our us subsidiaries  along with the intercompany sale of certain rigs between us and foreign subsidiaries based upon current projections of the long term geographic areas of operations of these rigs 
these transactions generated a us taxable gain which resulted in a total tax expense of approximately million 
this expense was reduced in part by the recognition of million of tax benefits resulting from the release of valuation allowances previously recorded against a portion of our us nol carryforwards  the recognition of a million tax benefit from the release of deferred tax liabilities and the deferral of million of tax expense related to the gain on the intercompany rig sales 
this net deferred tax benefit will be recognized for financial reporting purposes over the remaining useful lives of the rigs 
the total tax expense recognized for financial reporting purposes was million  comprised of million of deferred tax expense and million of current tax expense 
we have not provided for us deferred taxes on the unremitted earnings of our us subsidiaries that are permanently reinvested 
should a distribution be made to us from the unremitted earnings of these us subsidiaries  we could be required to record additional us current and deferred taxes

turnkey drilling estimates turnkey drilling projects often involve numerous subcontractors and third party vendors  and  as a result  the actual final project cost is typically not known at the time a project is completed 
we therefore rely on detailed cost estimates created by our project engineering staff to compute and record profits upon completion of turnkey drilling projects based on known revenues 
these cost estimates are adjusted as final actual project costs are determined  which may result in adjustments to previously recorded amounts 
further  we recognize estimated losses on turnkey drilling projects immediately upon occurrence of events which indicate that it is probable that a loss will be incurred and  depending on the timing of the events leading to loss recognition in relation to completion of the project  these cost estimates could be relatively significant to the total project costs

current market conditions and trends although market conditions continue to improve in all of the world s major offshore markets  historically the offshore drilling business has been cyclical  marked by periods of low demand  excess rig supply and low dayrates  followed by periods of high demand  short rig supply and increasing dayrates 
these cycles have been volatile and have traditionally been influenced by a number of factors  including oil and gas prices  the spending plans of our customers and the highly competitive nature of the offshore drilling industry 
even when rig markets appear to have stabilized at a certain level of utilization and dayrates or appear to be improving  these markets can change swiftly  making it difficult to predict trends or conditions in the market 
the relocation of rigs from weak markets to stable or strong markets may also have a significant impact on utilization and dayrates in the affected markets 
a summary of current industry market conditions and trends in our areas of operations follows worldwide our current worldwide market outlook for is one of continuing increases in demand  the result of which should be continued high levels of utilization and improvement in dayrates for our drilling rigs with available uncontracted time 

table of contents as market conditions improve further  we expect that a number of our competitors jackups and mid water depth semisubmersibles that are currently cold stacked ie minimally crewed with little or no scheduled maintenance being performed will continue to reenter the market 
in addition  orders for the construction of jackup rigs have been announced with delivery dates ranging from to all of these units are considered to be premium units 
in the ultra deepwater sector  there have been announcements of new high specification semisubmersible rigs  including our gsf development driller iii  four ultra deepwater drillships  and the upgrade of four other semisubmersibles to ultra deepwater units  with delivery forecast to occur from the first quarter of through a number of the contracts for units currently under construction provide for options for the construction of additional units  and we believe further new construction announcements are likely for all classes of rigs pursuant to the exercise of one or more of these options or otherwise 
during prior periods of high utilization and dayrates  the entry into service of newly constructed  upgraded and reactivated rigs created an oversupply of drilling units and a decline in utilization and dayrates  sometimes for extended periods of time as rigs were absorbed into the active fleet 
we do not currently anticipate that this increase in the number of active units will have a significant adverse effect on dayrates in the near future as there are indications of increased demand for these units over the course of the next few years 
any further increase in construction of new drilling units  however  may exacerbate any adverse effect on future utilization and dayrates 
deepwater and ultra deepwater market dayrates for deepwater and ultra deepwater rigs escalated in  reaching historical highs 
this trend has continued into all deepwater and ultra deepwater units in the us gulf of mexico are fully contracted for virtually all of deepwater and ultra deepwater units outside of the us gulf of mexico are also fully employed through virtually all of deepwater requirements of oil companies continue to grow  and  to the extent the demand created by these new projects cannot be addressed through rig farmouts  the projects will have to be deferred until or under these market conditions  we anticipate that we will continue to experience upward pressure on dayrates for our deepwater and ultra deepwater rigs 
us gulf of mexico jackup fleet utilization in the us gulf of mexico remained above the percent level at the end of  and associated dayrates continue to rise 
all marketed semisubmersibles in the us gulf of mexico are currently fully employed 
terms of contracts began to lengthen in the second quarter of and this trend continues 
the impact of hurricanes katrina and rita on both the jackup and semisubmersible fleets in the us gulf of mexico has been significant  with hurricane related damage putting a number of rigs out of service temporarily and in some cases permanently 
we expect that the effect of these storms  which have reduced rig supply  will result in continued upward pressure on dayrates and longer contract terms in this market in north sea the market for mid water depth semisubmersibles  hdhe jackups and standard jackups continues to improve in the north sea 
we believe the market for hdhe and standard specification jackup rigs will remain strong in  with dayrates for these rigs continuing to increase 
dayrates for marketed semisubmersibles in the north sea have surpassed historical highs for work commencing in mid and we expect the demand for the rigs to remain strong 
west africa demand in each segment of the west africa market continues to strengthen 
the west africa jackup fleet is currently fully utilized  and dayrates are increasing to record levels 
the mid water semisubmersible segment has also experienced full employment and high dayrates 
similarly  in the deepwater and ultra deepwater segments  we have observed strong demand and increasing dayrates 
there is no availability within the present offshore fleet in west africa  and  as a consequence  we expect rigs to move into the region during 
table of contents southeast asia dayrates for jackups in the southeast asia market surpassed historical highs during we continue to expect increasing demand to exceed the available supply of rigs for  creating shortages of available rigs and possibly delaying some drilling programs 
due to increases in demand in other jackup markets  we believe it is unlikely that there will be any significant movements of rigs into this area from other markets in as a result  we expect upward pressure on dayrates to continue at least until the delivery of the speculative newbuild rigs rigs that are built without a client commitment currently under construction in singapore 
the newbuild delivery period currently extends from early to  with peak delivery activity of speculative rigs scheduled to occur in middle east and mediterranean we expect the jackup market in the mediterranean to remain in balance through by early  we expect the jackup fleet in the mediterranean to increase by at least two additional units in order to meet demand requirements associated with announced exploration and development projects 
the gulf of suez continues to remain strong with all ten jackups in this area fully utilized 
dayrates for this sector are at all time highs 
strong market fundamentals remain intact for the arabian gulf due primarily to increasing demand offshore saudi arabia and qatar 
we anticipate the near term supply shortages and opportunities for significant increases in dayrates in the arabian gulf jackup market to be at least partially offset in by the delivery of newbuild rigs currently under construction 
south america and other the other markets in which we operate  south america  canada and the azerbaijan area of the caspian sea  remain stable and we expect little change through labor markets we require highly skilled personnel to operate our rigs and provide technical services and support for our business 
competition for the skilled and other labor required for deepwater and other drilling operations  including for our turnkey drilling and drilling management services business and our construction projects  intensifies as the number of rigs activated or added to worldwide fleets or under construction increases 
in periods of high utilization  such as the current period  we have found it more difficult to find and retain qualified individuals 
we have experienced tightening in the relevant labor markets within the last year and have recently sustained the loss of experienced personnel to our customers and competitors 
in response to these market conditions we have instituted retention programs  including increases in compensation  and have incurred other costs to retain our work force 
we expect these programs  along with the other costs  to increase our offshore labor costs by approximately million for if these labor trends continue  they could increase our costs further or limit our operations 
proposed regulations and insurance underwriter requirements hurricanes katrina and rita caused damage to a number of rigs in the gulf of mexico fleet and rigs that were moved off location by the storms may have done damage to platforms  pipelines  wellheads and other drilling rigs 
the mms is conducting hearings to determine methods to prevent or reduce the number of such incidents in the future 
insurance underwriters may require that gulf of mexico drilling rigs meet certain operational criteria as a condition of coverage 
mms regulation or insurance underwriter requirements may mandate that jackup drilling rigs operating in the gulf of mexico operate with a higher air gap during hurricane season  effectively reducing the water depth in which they can operate  or that they meet stricter criteria in terms of the soil conditions in which they operate 
the mms or underwriters may take other steps that could increase the cost of operations or reduce the area of operations for these rigs  thus reducing their marketability 
the mms 
table of contents and insurance underwriters may also require that semisubmersibles operating in the gulf of mexico strengthen their mooring systems or take other action to prevent the rigs from floating off location in adverse weather conditions  thereby materially increasing the capital costs of these rigs 
implementation of mms regulations or requirements of our insurance underwriters may subject us to increased costs or limit the operational capabilities of our rigs and could materially and adversely affect our operations and financial condition

these gains are discussed in more detail below 
excluding these gains  along with an impairment loss of million recorded in connection with the sale of the platform rig rig  adjusted operating income for was million  a decrease of million from the prior year 
this decrease was due primarily to lower turnkey drilling performance and lower dayrates and utilization for our drilling fleet  particularly our ultra deepwater and west africa fleets  offset in part by higher oil volumes produced

the decreases in dayrates and utilization were due primarily to lower dayrates and utilization for our ultra deepwater rigs and for our west africa drilling fleet  along with lower utilization and dayrates for the gsf galaxy ii off the eastern coast of canada  which remained idle for substantially all of the first half of before resuming operations in june  and to the exit from substantially all of our platform rig business during the fourth quarter of these decreases were offset in part by increases in dayrates for the us gulf of mexico jackup fleet and by the full period utilization of the gsf grand banks offshore canada  which was idle for the first half of contract drilling operating income and margin excluding intersegment revenues and expenses decreased to million and  respectively  for the year ended december  from million and  respectively  for  due primarily to the lower rig utilization and dayrates discussed above along with a decrease in contract drilling expenses due primarily to lower labor costs  primarily as a result of lower utilization and the exit from our platform rig operations as discussed above  lower reimbursable expenses and lower repair and maintenance expenses 
contract drilling depreciation expense also decreased for the year ended december  compared to as a result of the changing the estimates of remaining depreciable lives and salvage values for a portion of our fleet  as noted in the discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates  offset in part by depreciation expense related to the gsf constellation i and the gsf constellation ii  placed in service in august and september  respectively  and to upgrades on several other rigs in our fleet 
drilling management services results of operations from our drilling management services segment may be limited by certain factors  including our ability to find and retain qualified personnel  to hire suitable rigs at acceptable rates  and to obtain and successfully perform turnkey drilling contracts based on competitive bids 
our ability to obtain turnkey drilling contracts is largely dependent on the number of such contracts available for bid  which in turn is influenced by market prices for oil and gas  among other factors 
furthermore  our ability to enter into turnkey drilling contracts may be constrained from time to time by the availability of globalsantafe or third party drilling rigs  the supply of which has become even more constrained due to the number of rigs damaged and destroyed as a result of hurricane katrina and hurricane rita 
drilling management services results are also affected by the required deferral of turnkey drilling profit related to wells in which our oil and gas division is either the operator or holds a working interest 
this turnkey profit is credited to our full cost pool of oil and gas properties and is recognized over future periods through a lower depletion rate as reserves are produced 
accordingly  results of our drilling management service operations may vary widely from quarter to quarter and from year to year 
year ended december   compared to year ended december  drilling management services revenues increased by million to million for the year ended december   from million for approximately million of this increase was attributable to higher average revenues per turnkey project and million was attributable to an increase in daywork and other revenues  offset in part by an million decrease due to a decrease in the number of turnkey projects completed and a million decrease in reimbursable revenues 
the increase in average revenues per turnkey project is a result of obtaining higher contract prices due to increases in drilling costs  primarily dayrates  which have increased due to higher demand in the offshore drilling rig market 
this higher demand has also limited the availability of drilling rigs  contributing to a decrease in the number of turnkey projects completed compared to prior year 
the offshore drilling rig market has been further constrained by the number of rigs damaged and destroyed during hurricane katrina and hurricane rita 
the decrease in reimbursable revenues is due primarily to a decrease in project management operations in as noted above in the discussion of our contract drilling results  however  reimbursable revenues represent reimbursements

involuntary conversion of long lived assets and related recoveries four of our semisubmersible drilling rigs in the us gulf of mexico  the gsf arctic i  the gsf celtic sea  the gsf development driller i and the gsf development driller ii  sustained damage in hurricane katrina during august that rendered them unable to perform drilling operations 
as of december   the gsf arctic i and the gsf celtic sea had returned to service and the gsf development driller ii had gone on contract  although it ceased operations from mid december until february due to problems with the rigid conduit lines of its riser 
the gsf development driller i is still undergoing remediations which are currently expected to be completed during the second quarter of less than a month later  in late september  hurricane rita caused damage to four of our cantilevered jackup rigs in the us gulf of mexico the gsf high island ii  the gsf high island iii the gsf high island iv and the gsf adriatic vii 
as of december   the gsf high island ii is undergoing repairs that are expected to be completed in second quarter and the gsf high island iii and the gsf adriatic vii are still being evaluated to determine if either can be repaired or whether one or both will be declared a total constructive loss  as discussed below 
subsequent to year end the gsf high island iv entered the shipyard and remediations are expected to be completed in second quarter 
table of contents all of these rigs are covered for physical damage under the hull and machinery provision of our insurance policy  which carries a deductible of million per occurrence 
in addition  the gsf arctic i  the gsf development driller i and the gsf development driller ii are covered by loss of hire insurance under which we are reimbursed for percent of each rig s contracted dayrate for up to a maximum of days per rig following days the waiting period of lost revenue 
our insurance policy provides that if claims for a single event are filed under both the hull and machinery and loss of hire sections of the policy  we will bear only a single deductible from that occurrence of no more than the highest deductible from any individual section 
hurricanes katrina and rita are each considered to be a separate occurrence 
based on remediations completed for the gsf development driller ii and the remediations in progress for the gsf development driller i  the amount of revenue we lost during the waiting period will be higher than the million hull and machinery deductible 
therefore  the day waiting period under our loss of hire insurance will serve as the only deductible for the hurricane katrina event 
the application of the day waiting period provision with regard to the gsf development driller i and gsf development driller ii  however  is complicated by the fact that at the time of the hurricane both rigs were undergoing thruster remediations and accordingly  we had already put our underwriters on notice as to a claim under the loss of hire section of the policy 
as discussed at management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations investing and financing activities in december we recorded million for loss of hire recoveries with respect to the gsf development driller i but did not record any loss of hire recoveries with respect to the gsf development driller ii 
we also did not receive any loss of hire proceeds with respect to the gsf arctic i  which resumed operations within days of hurricane katrina 
none of the jackup rigs damaged during hurricane rita were insured for loss of hire and  therefore  a single million hull and machinery deductible will apply for damage to the rigs caused by hurricane rita 
based on preliminary and ongoing evaluations of the damage sustained by these rigs  we have recorded an estimated involuntary conversion loss totaling approximately million against the carrying value of the rigs 
the majority of this loss has been offset by expected insurance recoveries totaling million  which is included in accounts receivable from insurers on the consolidated balance sheet as of december  the net loss of million discussed above represents our deductible for hurricane rita  and is included in involuntary conversion of long lived assets  net of related recoveries and loss of hire recoveries in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended december  capital costs incurred to remediate damage to the rigs will increase the capitalized value of the rigs 
while we have recorded our best estimates of the damage sustained by each rig based on the information presently available  further evaluations or other developments could result in an adjustment to our financial results in future periods 
upon completion of our damage assessment on the gsf high island iii and gsf adriatic vii  which should be completed by the end of the first quarter of  it is possible that one or both of the rigs will be out of service for approximately two years if refurbishment and upgrade is undertaken or be permanently removed from service if declared to be a constructive total loss 
during hurricane rita  both rigs had their legs sheared off and their drilling capabilities destroyed  together with other damage 
if either the gsf high island iii or gsf adriatic vii is declared to be a constructive total loss  we will be entitled to receive the total insured values of the rigs of million and million  respectively  of which million and million  respectively  is already included in accounts receivable from insurers  as discussed above 
taking into consideration the losses already recorded on the gsf high island iii and gsf adriatic vii  they have a current book value of million and million  respectively  which is equal to their estimated salvage value 
if the rigs are declared to be a constructive total loss  we will record gains on the gsf high island iii and gsf adriatic vii of million and million  respectively  which is equal to the remaining insurance proceeds not already recorded as accounts receivable from insurers  less their book value 
title to the rigs will then pass to our insurance underwriters 
in the event that we determine to remediate the damage to the rigs and return them to service  we will be entitled to receive up to million for the gsf high island iii and up to million for the gsf adriatic vii  which includes the amounts already recorded in accounts receivable from insurers  as discussed above  towards the repair costs and we will maintain ownership of the rigs 
any capital costs incurred to remediate damage to the rigs will increase the capitalized value of the rigs 

table of contents we estimate that for  the damage inflicted by hurricane katrina and hurricane rita had a negative impact of million  or per diluted ordinary share  on our net income 
this was due primarily to reduced revenue from the damaged rigs along with the pre tax million deductible  as discussed above 
these negative effects were partially offset by reductions in operating expenses  the estimated loss of hire recovery from insurers  and tax benefits associated with the reduction in revenue and the million deductible 
we do not expect the damage inflicted by hurricane katrina and hurricane rita to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in august  the jackup gsf adriatic iv encountered well control problems  caught fire and sank while drilling in the mediterranean sea off the coast of egypt 
all of our personnel on board the rig were evacuated safely  although the rig was a total loss 
we received insurance proceeds totaling million  net of our deductible  and recorded a gain of million  net of taxes  in the third quarter of general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses for the year ended december   increased by million to million  or of revenues  from million  or of revenues  for the increase in general and administrative expenses was due primarily to pension expense for two retiring executives  amortization of restricted stock  which was granted to employees in february and is expensed over a three year period  and costs associated with training and support our of new enterprise resource management software system  which was placed into service on january   along with costs incurred in connection with the implementation of this system in our foreign offices 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december   increased by million to million  or of revenues  from million  or of revenues  for the increase in general and administrative expenses was due primarily to an increase in management bonus accruals from relatively low levels  as discussed below  along with an increase in consulting fees incurred as part of our implementation of the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of other income and expense interest expense was million for  million for and million for the decrease in interest expense for was due primarily to the retirement of global marine s notes due in the second quarter of and the repurchase of the zero coupon convertible debentures during the second and third quarters of  as discussed below in liquidity and capital resources investing and financing activities 
the decrease in interest expense in compared to is due primarily to the retirement of global marine inc s notes due on june  we capitalized million  million and million of interest costs in  and  respectively  primarily in connection with our rig expansion program discussed in liquidity and capital resources investing and financing activities 
interest income increased to million for the year ended december   from million in  due primarily to an increase in our average rate of return on our investments 
interest income increased to million for the year ended december   from million in  due primarily to an increase in our average cash and marketable securities balances for as a result of the receipt of proceeds from the sale of our land rig fleet  the insurance proceeds from the loss of the gsf adriatic iv and the sale of a portion of our oil and gas division s interest in the broom field  offset in part by funds used to redeem global marine inc s notes due 
table of contents on june   we completed the redemption of the entire outstanding million principal amount of global marine inc s notes due  for a total redemption price of million  plus accrued and unpaid interest of million 
we recognized a loss on the early retirement of debt of approximately million  net of tax of million  in the second quarter of we funded the redemption price from our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances 
other income of million for the year ended december   consists of realized gains on marketable securities related to our nonqualified pension plans  offset by costs incurred to settle a canadian tax audit for the years and expenses incurred to support our employees after hurricanes katrina and rita 
other expense of million for the year ended december   includes a loss of million on a commodity derivative entered into in the first quarter of  offset in part by realized gains of million on the sale of marketable securities related to one of our nonqualified pension plans 
other income totaled million for the year ended december   due primarily to million awarded to us in as a result of the settlement of claims filed in with the united nations compensation commission uncc for losses suffered as a result of the iraqi invasion of kuwait in the claims were for the loss of four rigs and associated equipment  lost revenue and miscellaneous expenditures 
income taxes our effective income tax rates for financial reporting purposes were approximately  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the effective rate for includes the effect of a million charge related to the subsidiary realignment discussed below 
excluding the million charge  our income tax expense would have been million  which when compared to our pretax income from continuing operations of million  yields an effective tax rate of for the effective tax of is lower than due primarily to a change in our mix of earnings between domestic earnings and foreign earnings with an increase in foreign earnings in low tax jurisdictions 
earnings in low taxed jurisdictions increased significantly in along with a million book gain on the sale of the drilling rig glomar robert 
f 
bauer that was not subject to tax 
us taxable income also increased  resulting in the utilization of million of an expiring us nol 
the utilization of this portion of the nol triggered the release of a previously recorded valuation allowance and the recognition of a million tax benefit 
the effective tax rate was further reduced due to lower statutory tax rates in various foreign jurisdictions and a net tax benefit from the resolution of tax audits and tax return filings at amounts lower than had been previously estimated 
the effective rate for was reduced by the effect of the million uncc award  partially offset by a net total of million of other discrete items 
excluding these settlements  our adjusted pretax income from continuing operations for would have been million  which when compared to the tax provision from continuing operations of million  yields an adjusted effective tax rate of 
the adjusted effective tax rate of for is higher than due primarily to a change in our mix of earnings between domestic earnings and foreign high and low tax jurisdictions 
the tax provision for also includes a net deferred tax benefit of million related to the release of a valuation allowance against our uk nol carryforwards 
we determined during that  based on earnings projections at that time  it was more likely than not that the remaining nol carryforwards balance in this jurisdiction would be fully utilized 
the effective tax rates for and excluding the effects of these unusual items are presented because we believe that these effective tax rates will provide assistance in comparing the results between the periods 
in december  we completed a realignment of our subsidiaries to separate our international and domestic holding companies to improve operational and financial efficiencies within our organization 
this realignment included the redemption of a minority interest in a foreign subsidiary held by one of our us subsidiaries  along with the intercompany sale of certain rigs between us and foreign subsidiaries based upon current projections of the long term geographic areas of operations of these rigs 
these transactions generated a us taxable gain which resulted in a total tax expense of approximately million 
this expense was reduced in part by the recognition of million of tax benefits resulting from the release of valuation allowances previously recorded against a portion of our us nol carryforwards  the recognition of a 
table of contents million tax benefit from the release of deferred tax liabilities and the deferral of million of tax expense related to the gain on the intercompany rig sales 
this net deferred tax benefit will be recognized for financial reporting purposes over the remaining useful lives of the rigs 
the total tax expense recognized for financial reporting purposes was million  comprised of million of deferred tax expense and million of current tax expense 
we intend to permanently reinvest all of the unremitted earnings of our us subsidiaries in their businesses 
as a result  we have not provided for us deferred taxes on billion of cumulative unremitted earnings at december  should a distribution be made to us from the unremitted earnings of our us subsidiaries  we could be required to record additional us current and deferred taxes 
it is not practicable to estimate the amount of deferred tax liability associated with these unremitted earnings 
transactions with affiliates until december  kuwait petroleum corporation  through its wholly owned subsidiary  sfic holdings cayman  inc  owned a portion of our outstanding shares 
at december   kuwait petroleum corporation held  ordinary shares  approximately of our ordinary shares 
during  we repurchased all  ordinary shares from kuwait petroleum corporation with the net proceeds of public offerings of an equal number of ordinary shares  as described under liquidity and capital resources investing and financing activities 
kuwait petroleum corporation s ownership interest had entitled it to certain rights pursuant to an intercompany agreement entered into with santa fe international in connection with the initial public offering of santa fe international and amended in connection with the merger 
the intercompany agreement  as amended  provided that  as long as kuwait petroleum corporation and its affiliates  in the aggregate  owned at least of our outstanding ordinary shares  the consent of sfic holdings was required to change the jurisdiction of any of our existing subsidiaries or incorporate a new subsidiary in any jurisdiction in a manner materially adversely affecting the rights or interests of kuwait petroleum corporation and its affiliates or to reincorporate us in another jurisdiction and provide sfic holdings rights to access information concerning us 
the intercompany agreement  as amended  also provided that sfic holdings had the right to designate up to three representatives to our board of directors based on sfic holdings ownership percentage 
as of december   all of sfic holdings representatives on our board of directors had resigned 
we still maintain an agency agreement with a subsidiary of kuwait petroleum corporation that obligates us to pay certain agency fees in return for their sponsorship that allows us to operate in kuwait 
during the year ended december   we paid  of agency fees pursuant to the agency agreement 
we did not earn any revenues from koc or its affiliate during during the year ended december   we earned revenues from koc and its affiliate for performing land contract drilling services in the ordinary course of business totaling million and paid  of agency fees pursuant to the agency agreement 
during the year ended december   we earned revenues from koc and its affiliate for performing land contract drilling services in the ordinary course of business totaling million and paid  of agency fees pursuant to the agency agreement 
at december  and  we had accounts receivable from affiliates of kuwait petroleum corporation of million and million  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity our primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities and cash generated from operations 
as of december   we had million of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  all of which were unrestricted 
we had million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities at december   all of which were unrestricted 
cash generated from operating activities totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 

table of contents we entered into an agreement dated june   to sell the glomar robert f 
bauer drillship for million 
we completed this sale in november  and we recorded a million gain in the fourth quarter of investing and financing activities during the first quarter of  we took delivery of our two ultra deepwater semisubmersibles ordered from ppl shipyard pte  ltd 
of singapore ppl  the gsf development driller i and the gsf development driller ii 
construction costs for the gsf development driller i totaled approximately million  excluding an estimated million of capital spares  startup expenses  customer required modifications and mobilization costs  million related to the thruster defect discussed below  and million of capitalized interest 
we have incurred a total of approximately million of capitalized costs related to the gsf development driller i  excluding capitalized interest  as of december  construction costs for the gsf development driller ii totaled approximately million  excluding an estimated million of capital spares  startup expenses  customer required modifications and mobilization costs  million related to the thruster defect discussed below  and million of capitalized interest 
we have incurred a total of approximately million of capitalized costs related to the gsf development driller ii  excluding capitalized interest  as of december  both of these rigs sustained hurricane related damage during we expect to recover the costs to remediate the hurricane related damage to these rigs from our underwriters 
during the second quarter of we discovered a defect and resulting damage in the thruster nozzles on the two new ultra deepwater semisubmersibles 
both rigs were being remediated for the thruster defect and resulting damage when they sustained additional damage as a result of hurricane katrina 
this additional damage further delayed the start of the initial drilling contracts for the gsf development driller ii and the gsf development driller i 
remediations of gsf development driller ii have been completed and the rig went on contract in november however  in december problems were noted on the rigid conduit lines on the riser and the rig was no longer able to perform drilling operations 
evaluations are ongoing  but a temporary modification allowed the rig to resume drilling operations in february remediation of this problem will also be required on the gsf development driller i riser and the spare riser string shared by both rigs 
the estimated cost to remediate the problem for the risers on both rigs and the spare riser is expected to be between million to million and will be added to the capitalized cost of the rigs 
the riser damage  the thruster defect and damage from the hurricanes have further delayed the start of the initial drilling contract for the gsf development driller i until the second quarter of as noted above  we currently expect that the cost to remediate the thruster equipment for both rigs  exclusive of continued capitalized interest  will be approximately million 
we expect the costs to remediate the hurricane katrina damage to the two semisubmersibles to total approximately million 
any costs not recovered from the manufacturer or our insurance underwriters in respect of the repair and replacement costs for the thruster damage or hurricane damage will be added to the capitalized cost of the rigs 
we will also make claims under our loss of hire insurance for the rigs for the periods required to remediate the damage arising from both the thruster defect and hurricane katrina 
under our loss of hire insurance  after the day waiting period we are entitled to reimbursement for our full dayrate for up to days 
significant unresolved issues remain as to the proper application of the loss of hire waiting periods  which could lead to substantial differences in the amount of the loss of hire recovery 
the underwriters have formally reserved their rights to decline coverage for the thruster damage claims on the rigs in respect of both the hull and machinery and loss of hire coverage 
as a result  in we have recorded estimated loss of hire insurance recoveries equal to million with respect to the gsf development driller i  which is the amount we deem to be probable under the assumption that the rig will bear two consecutive day waiting periods  one for the thruster damage claim and one for the hurricane damage claim 
the gsf development driller ii was not out of service longer than the combined day waiting period and therefore no loss of hire recoveries have been recorded for the rig 
when the loss of hire claims are resolved with the underwriters  the amount of loss of hire recoveries could be different than the amount currently recorded 

table of contents we expect to fund all remaining construction and startup costs of these rigs from our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances  and future cash flow from operations 
due to the extent of remediation  coupled with the long delivery times for critical replacement parts  the gsf development driller i is not projected to start work until the second quarter of  as noted above 
the gsf high island ii shifted during hurricane rita causing the legs to become damaged when attempts were made to jack down the rig 
we were able to successfully jack the rig down in january and following leg repairs it is expected that the rig will go back to work at the start of the second quarter of the gsf high island iv experienced damage to its spud cans during hurricane rita 
the rig is currently undergoing repairs and we expect the rig will go back to work in the second quarter of at this time we do not know when  or if  the gsf high island iii or the gsf adriatic vii jackups will return to work but we expect to complete our assessment of the rigs by the end of the first quarter of the downtime for these repairs and possible permanent loss of two of these rigs will have an adverse effect on our results of operations in future periods see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations involuntary conversion of long lived assets and related recoveries 
in addition  estimated start dates could be further delayed if the magnitude of the damage is greater than expected based on our preliminary assessment or if the remediation is delayed by supply shortages  shipyard unavailability  unforeseen engineering issues  adverse weather conditions or other complications 
we expect to fund any costs incurred associated with remediating the rigs damaged by hurricane katrina and hurricane rita  to the extent they are not recovered from the insurance underwriters  from our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances and future cash flow from operations 
bp america production company bp has awarded a three year contract to the gsf development driller ii for its atlantis project in the us gulf of mexico

the multi well exploration and development program is expected to commence early in the second quarter of  following correction of the thruster defect and damage caused by hurricane katrina  and has a total contract value of million 
in the first quarter of we entered into a contract with keppel fels  a shipyard located in singapore  for construction of a new ultra deepwater semisubmersible  to be named the gsf development driller iii 
construction costs  excluding capital spares  startup costs  capitalized interest  customer required modifications and mobilization costs  are estimated to total approximately million  with construction commencing in the first quarter of and delivery currently expected during the first quarter in the first quarter of we made an initial shipyard progress payment of million 
we anticipate funding construction through our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances and future cash flow from operations 
we have entered into a letter of intent with a major oil and gas company for a seven year contract for the rig  providing for expected revenues of approximately billion  and expect to finalize a drilling contract in the first quarter of during  we issued a total of  ordinary shares in two public offerings and in each case immediately used the net proceeds to repurchase an equal number of our ordinary shares from a subsidiary of kuwait petroleum corporation at a price per share equal to the net proceeds per share we received in the offering 
the first offering was in april  in which we issued  ordinary shares at an aggregate price  net of underwriting discount  of approximately million per share 
the second offering was in december  in which we issued  ordinary shares at an aggregate price  net of underwriting discount  of approximately million per share 
in connection with these transactions  we incurred a total of million of expenses  which were recorded as a reduction of additional paid in capital 
there was no change in the number of outstanding shares as a result of the two transactions as the shares repurchased were immediately cancelled 

table of contents during the second quarter of  we repurchased million principal amount at maturity of the then outstanding million principal amount of global marine inc s zero coupon convertible debentures due september  for a total purchase price of million  representing million in principal payment and million in imputed interest 
on august   we redeemed the remaining  principal amount at maturity  bringing the total repurchase price of million  representing million in principal payment and million in imputed interest 
we purchased all of the debentures for repurchase at a purchase price of per  of principal amount  plus additional imputed interest for all securities purchased after june   calculated from june  to the date of purchase 
we funded the repurchase price from our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances 
our debt to capitalization ratio  calculated as the ratio of total debt  including undefeased capitalized lease obligations  to the sum of total shareholders equity and total debt  was at december   compared to at december  our total debt includes the current portion of our capitalized lease obligations  which totaled million at both december  and future cash requirements at december   we had total long term debt and capital lease obligations  including the current portion of our long term debt and capital lease obligations  of million and shareholders equity of  million 
long term debt  including current maturities  consisted of million net of discount notes due  net of discount notes due  and capitalized lease obligations  including the current portion  totaling million

annual interest on the notes is million  payable semiannually each february and august 
no principal payments are due under the notes or the notes until the maturity date 
we may redeem the notes and the notes in whole at any time  or in part from time to time  at a price equal to of the principal amount thereof plus accrued interest  if any  to the date of redemption  plus a premium  if any  relating to the then prevailing treasury yield and the remaining life of the notes 
the indentures relating to the notes and the notes contain limitations on our ability to incur indebtedness for borrowed money secured by certain liens and on our ability to engage in certain sale leaseback transactions 
the notes continue to be obligation of global marine inc  and globalsantafe corporation has not guaranteed this obligation 
globalsantafe corporation is the sole obligor under the notes 
we expect contract drilling costs  excluding reimbursable expenses  to be around billion 
the projected increases are due to expected increases in labor costs  as discussed under current market conditions and trends labor markets  changes in our fleet  primarily due to the addition of the gsf development driller i and gsf development driller ii  increases in repair and maintenance expense  and assumed increase in insurance costs  retention programs  stock based compensation expense  and pension expense

the reactivation of the gsf arctic ii was completed in september and the rig immediately went on contract 
on march   our board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to billion of our ordinary shares from time to time 
this repurchase plan supersedes our prior plan  authorized by our board of directors in august authorizing the purchase of up million of our ordinary shares  under which we repurchased a total of million of shares in no repurchases under the prior plan were made during and the repurchases of shares from a subsidiary of kuwait petroleum corporation described above were not made pursuant to the plan 
we have various commitments primarily related to our debt and capital lease obligations  leases for office space and other property and equipment as well as commitments for construction of drilling rigs 
we expect to fund these commitments from our existing cash and cash equivalents and future cash flow from operations 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december  payments due by period contractual obligation total less than year years years after years in millions principal payments on long term debt interest payments capital lease obligations non cancellable operating leases construction and development commitments total contractual obligations represents cash payments required 
long term debt  totaled  net of unamortized discount  at december  represents cash payments required 
a portion of these obligations is recorded on our balance sheet at net present value at december  consists of commitments related to the remaining newbuild construction 
this number does not include the payments for the new semisubmersible  as the commitment was not entered into until we expect to spend million in for the construction of the new rig 
as part of our goal of enhancing long term shareholder value  we have from time to time considered and actively pursued business combinations  the acquisition or construction of suitable additional drilling rigs and other assets or the possible sale of existing assets 
if we decide to undertake a business combination or an acquisition or additional construction projects  the issuance of additional debt or additional shares could be required 
we expect that sometime in the future we will likely replace the jackups gsf adriatic iv  which was lost in a fire  and the gsf high island iii and gsf adriatic vii  if either is declared a constructive total loss  through the acquisition or construction of replacement assets 
we frequently bid for or negotiate with customers regarding multi year drilling contracts  including  from time to time  contracts that would necessitate the construction of a new drilling rig to fulfill the contract 
our current strategy is to consider construction of a new floating rig only when expected cash flows from the anticipated contract would cover a substantial portion of the capital cost of the rig 
we believe that we will be able to meet all of our current obligations  including working capital requirements  capital expenditures  lease obligations  construction and development commitments and debt service  from our existing cash  cash equivalents and total marketable securities balances  along with future cash flow from operations 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued a revision of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 share based payment sfasr 
this statement revises fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and requires companies to recognize the cost of employee stock options and other awards of stock based compensation based on the fair value of the award as of the grant date 
this statement supersedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 which allowed companies to compute compensation cost for each employee stock option granted as the amount by which the quoted market price of the common stock on the date of grant exceeds the amount the employee must pay to acquire the stock 
we currently account for our stock option and stock based compensation plans using the intrinsic value method under apb opinion no 
the fasb has now deferred the effective date of sfasr to the beginning of the first annual period that begins after june  we have adopted this statement effective january   using the modified prospective application as prescribed under sfasr and this will be reflected in our results 
based on our unvested stock option grants as of december   we estimate that the adoption of this statement in will reduce the net income by approximately million  or per diluted share 
we do not expect the adoption of sfasr to have a material impact on our consolidated cash flows or financial position 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk in  we entered into fixed price contracts for the construction of two dynamically positioned  ultra deepwater drillships  the gsf cr luigs and the gsf jack ryan  which began operating in april and december  respectively 
pursuant to two year capital lease agreements  we subsequently novated the construction contracts for the drillships to two financial institutions the lessors  which now own the drillships and lease them to us 
we have deposited with three large foreign banks the payment banks amounts equal to the progress payments that the lessors were required to make under the construction contracts  less a lease benefit of approximately million the defeasance payment 
in exchange for the deposits  the payment banks have assumed liability for making rental payments required under the leases and the lessors have legally released us as the primary obligor of such rental payments 
accordingly  we have recorded no capital lease obligations on our balance sheet with respect to the two drillships 
in october  we provided consent to allow the sale of the lessor of the gsf cr luigs from one large foreign bank to another 
in exchange for our consent  if we exercise our right to terminate the lease between march  and december   we will receive consideration which will equal any sum we are obligated to pay on our termination of the lease 
in addition  if we exercise our termination rights during this period  we will no longer bear the estimated million in interest rate risk associated with the gsf cr luigs lease  discussed below 
upon termination of the lease  we will become the owner of the rig 
the lessor has the right to defer termination of the lease up to december  and has agreed to pay us million if termination is deferred past june  and a further million if termination is deferred past september  these amounts will reduce the carrying value of the rig 
our present intent is to exercise our right to terminate the lease in the second quarter of we continue to have interest rate risk in connection with the fully defeased financing lease for the gsf jack ryan and until termination  the gsf cr luigs  as discussed above 
the defeasance payment earns interest based on the british pound sterling three month libor  which approximated at the time of the agreement 
should the defeasance payment earn less than the assumed rate of interest  we will be required to make additional payments as necessary to augment the annual payments made by the payment banks pursuant to the agreements 
if the december   libor rate of were to continue over the next seven years  we would be required to fund an additional estimated million and million for the gsf jack ryan and gsf cr luigs  respectively  during that period 
the estimated combined amount for the two rigs of million represents a decrease from the amount estimated as of december  due to the yearly progress payments made by the payment banks 
if the december  libor rate of were to continue over the eight years subsequent thereto  the additional funding requirement would have been an estimated million for both rigs 
any additional payments made by us pursuant to the financing leases would increase the carrying value of our leasehold interest in the rigs and therefore be reflected in higher depreciation expense over their then remaining useful lives 
we do not expect that  if required  any additional payments made under these leases would be material to our financial position  results of operations or cash flows in any given year 
in addition to these defeased financing leases  we also have entered into fixed for floating interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of million as of both december  and  effectively converting a portion of our notes into variable rate debt see fair value risk below 
we do not consider our exposure to interest rate fluctuations as a result of these swaps to be material to our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
fair value risk investments 
the objectives of our investment strategy are safety of principal  liquidity maintenance  yield maximization and full investment of all available funds 
as a result  the portion of our short term investments portfolio classified as cash and cash equivalents at december   consisted primarily of high credit quality 
table of contents commercial paper  us government agency securities and money market funds  all with original maturities of less than three months 
we believe that the carrying value of these investments approximated market value at december   due to the short term nature of these instruments 
we have outsourced the management of portions of our marketable securities portfolio to third party investment firms 
these firms manage the investment of these securities with the goal of optimizing returns on these investments while investing within guidelines set forth by our management 
pursuant to the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  we have classified our marketable securities portfolio as available for sale  and have recorded these marketable securities at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet at december  and in addition  we held other investments in debt and equity securities also classified as available for sale held in connection with certain nonqualified pension plans  which were included in other assets at december  and unrealized gains included in accumulated other comprehensive income on the consolidated balance sheet at december  and  related to our total marketable securities portfolio totaled approximately million and million  respectively 
due to the short term maturities of our securities we do not believe that we have a material fair value risk associated with changes in interest rates 
long term debt 
our long term debt is subject to fair value risk due to changes in market interest rates 
the zero coupon convertible debentures due were purchased during and accordingly  none were outstanding at december  the estimated fair value of our million principal amount notes due  based on quoted market prices  was million at december   compared to the carrying amount of million net of discount 
the estimated fair value of our million principal amount notes due  based on quoted market prices  was million at december   compared to the carrying amount of million net of discount 
the carrying value of our notes due includes a mark to market adjustment of million at december   related to fixed for floating interest rate swaps discussed below 
the estimated fair value of our notes due  based on quoted market prices  was million at december   compared to the carrying amount of million net of discount 
the estimated fair market value of our notes due  based on quoted market prices  was million at december   compared to the carrying amount of million net of discount 
the carrying value of our notes due included a mark to market adjustment of million at december   related to fixed for floating interest rate swaps discussed below 
we have engaged third party consultants to assess the impact of changes in interest rates on the fair values of our long term debt based on a hypothetical ten percent increase in market interest rates 
market interest rate volatility is dependent on many factors that are impossible to forecast  and actual interest rate increases could be more severe than the hypothetical ten percent change 
based upon these sensitivity analyses  if prevailing market interest rates had been ten percent higher at december   and all other factors affecting our debt remained the same  the fair value of our notes due  as determined on a present value basis using prevailing market interest rates  would have decreased by million or and the fair value of the notes due would have decreased by million or 
under comparable sensitivity analysis as of december   the fair value of the notes due would have decreased by million or and the fair value of the notes due would have decreased by million or 
we manage our fair value risk related to our long term debt by using interest rate swaps to convert a portion of our fixed rate debt into variable rate debt 
under these interest rate swaps  we agree with other parties to exchange  at specified intervals  the difference between the fixed rate and floating rate amounts  calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional amount 

table of contents as of december  and  we had outstanding fixed for floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of million  through february these interest rate swaps are intended to manage a portion of the fair value risk related to our notes due the notes 
under the terms of these swaps  we have agreed to pay the counterparties an interest rate equal to the six month libor rate less to on the notional amounts and we will receive the fixed rate 
the total estimated aggregate fair value of these swaps at december  and was an asset of million and million  respectively 
the change in the estimated fair values of our long term debt and corresponding interest rate swaps from to is a result of changes in the long term treasury bond rates 
in connection with the sensitivity analyses performed relative to the fair values of our long term debt discussed above  similar analyses were performed to assess the impact of market interest rate movements on the fair values of the fixed for floating swaps related to the notes 
based upon these analyses  if prevailing market interest rates had been ten percent higher at december   and all other factors affecting these swaps had remained the same  the aggregate fair value of the fixed for floating interest rate swaps  as determined on a present value basis using prevailing market interest rates  would have decreased by million or 
under comparable sensitivity analysis as of december   the fair value would have decreased by million or 
foreign currency risk we are subject to foreign currency risk throughout our international operations see item a 
risk factors we may suffer losses as a result of foreign exchange restrictions  foreign currency fluctuations and limitations on our ability to repatriate income or capital to the us 
in certain cases we attempt to minimize this currency risk by seeking international drilling contracts payable in local currency in amounts that approximate our estimated local currency based operating costs and in us dollars for the balance of the contract 
we incurred foreign currency exchange losses totaling approximately million in our foreign currency exchange losses totaled approximately million in and were immaterial in due to the multiple foreign currencies impacting our various areas of operations  we cannot accurately quantify through a sensitivity analysis the impact of changes in these currencies 
we have not historically entered into financial hedging transactions to manage risks relating to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
we may  however  enter into such transactions in the future 
credit risk the market for our services and products is the offshore oil and gas industry  and our customers consist primarily of major integrated international oil companies and independent oil and gas producers 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and have not historically required material collateral 
we maintain reserves for potential credit losses  and such losses have been within management s expectations 
our cash deposits were distributed among various banks in our areas of operations throughout the world as of december  and in addition  we utilize external money managers to invest excess cash in accordance with our investment guidelines 
these managers have invested our funds in commercial paper  money market funds  asset backed securities  government issues and corporate obligations 
each of these investments comply with our investment guidelines in terms of security type  credit rating  duration  portfolio and issuer exposure limits 
as a result  we believe that credit risk in such instruments is minimal
