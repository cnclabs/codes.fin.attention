item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations we report our fiscal year on a week period ending on the last saturday in october of each year 
accordingly  the fiscal year ends for fiscal years   and were october   and  respectively 
as is customary for companies that use the week convention  every th year contains a week fiscal year 
as a result  our fiscal year was a week fiscal year 
also as a result  our second quarter of fiscal year included one extra week and was weeks in length 
fiscal years and were both week fiscal years 
the following table sets forth certain financial data for the periods indicated as a percentage of total net revenues fiscal year ended october  october  october  net revenues cost of revenues gross margin operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative internal review and sec investigation costs settlement of an acquisition related claim amortization of deferred stock compensation restructuring costs reversals in process research and development lease termination charge and other  net total operating expenses income loss from operations interest and other income  net interest expense gain on repurchases of convertible subordinated debt gain loss on investments  net income loss before provision for income taxes income tax provision net income loss revenues 
our revenues are derived primarily from sales of our silkworm family of products 
our silkworm products  which range in size from ports to ports  connect servers and storage devices creating a san 
net revenues for the year ended october  were million  a decrease of four percent compared with net revenues of million for the year ended october  for the year ended october   the decrease in net revenues reflected a percent decline in average selling price per port  partially offset by an percent increase in the number of ports shipped 
net revenues for the year ended october  increased percent compared with net revenues of million for the year ended october  for the year ended october   the increase in net revenues reflected a percent increase in the number of ports shipped  partially offset by a percent decline in average selling price per port 
the declines in average selling prices are the result of a more competitive pricing environment 
we believe the increase in the number of ports shipped reflects higher demand for our products as end users continue to consolidate storage and servers infrastructures using sans  expand sans to support more applications  and deploy sans in new environments 

table of contents we expect the number of ports shipped to fluctuate depending on the demand for our existing and recently introduced products as well as the timing of product transitions by our oem customers 
we also expect that average selling price per port will likely decline at rates consistent with the rates we experienced in the year ended october   unless they are adversely affected by accelerated pricing pressures  new product introductions by us or our competitors  or other factors that may be beyond our control 
historically  domestic revenues have been between percent and percent of total revenues 
domestic and international revenues were approximately percent and percent of our total revenues  respectively  for the year ended october  for the year ended october   domestic and international revenues were approximately percent and percent of our total revenues  respectively  and for the year ended october   domestic and international revenues were approximately percent and percent of our total revenues  respectively 
revenues are attributed to geographic areas based on the location of the customer to which our products are shipped 
international revenues primarily consist of sales to customers in western europe and the greater asia pacific region 
for the years ended october  and october   international revenues have increased primarily as a result of faster growth in the asia pacific region relative to north america and europe 
however  certain oem customers take possession of our products domestically and then distribute these products to their international customers 
because we account for all of those oem revenues as domestic revenues  we cannot be certain of the extent to which our domestic and international revenue mix is impacted by the practices of our oem customers 
a significant portion of our revenue is concentrated among a relatively small number of oem customers 
for the year ended october   three customers  emc  hp and ibm  each represented greater than ten percent of our total revenues for a combined total of percent of our total revenues 
for the years ended october  and october   the same three customers each represented greater than ten percent of our total revenues for combined totals of percent and percent of our total revenues  respectively 
we expect that a significant portion of our future revenues will continue to come from sales of products to a relatively small number of oem customers 
therefore  the loss of  or a decrease in the level of sales to  or a change in the ordering pattern of  any one of these customers could seriously harm our financial condition and results of operations 
gross margin 
gross margin for the year ended october  was percent  an increase of percent from percent for the year ended october  cost of goods sold consists of product costs  which are variable  and manufacturing operations costs  which are generally fixed 
for the year ended october   product costs relative to net revenues decreased by percent as compared to the year ended october  due to decreases in component and manufacturing costs 
manufacturing operations costs relative to net revenues decreased by percent principally due to increases in number of ports shipped 
in addition  gross margin increased by percent due to higher stock compensation expense in the year ended october  primarily as a result of changes in the market value of our common stock 
for the year ended october   gross margin increased by percent from percent for the year ended october  product costs relative to net revenues decreased by percent as compared to the year ended october  due to decreases in component and manufacturing costs 
manufacturing operations costs relative to net revenues remained consistent 
in addition  gross margin decreased by percent due to higher stock compensation expense in the year ended october  primarily as a result of changes in the market value of our common stock 
the decrease in product costs relative to net revenues was primarily the result of lower component and manufacturing costs  partially offset by declines in average unit selling prices of our products 
gross margin is primarily affected by average selling price per port  number of ports shipped  and cost of goods sold 
we expect that average selling price per port for our products will continue to decline at rates consistent with the rates we experienced in the year ended october   unless they are further affected by accelerated pricing pressures  new product introductions by us or our competitors  or other factors that may be beyond our control 
we believe that we have the ability to partially mitigate the effect of declines in average selling price per port on gross margins through our product and manufacturing operations cost reductions 
however  the average selling price per port could decline at a faster pace than we anticipate 
if this dynamic occurs  we may not be able to reduce our costs fast enough to prevent a decline in our gross margins 
in addition  we must also maintain or increase current volume of ports shipped to maintain our current gross margins 
if we are unable to offset future reductions of average selling price per port with reductions in product and manufacturing operations costs  or if as a result of future reductions in average selling price per port our revenues do not grow  our gross margins would be negatively affected 

table of contents we recently introduced several new products and expect to introduce additional new products in the future 
as new or enhanced products are introduced  we must successfully manage the transition from older products in order to minimize disruption in customers ordering patterns  avoid excessive levels of older product inventories  and provide sufficient supplies of new products to meet customer demands 
our gross margins may be adversely affected if we fail to successfully manage the introductions of these new products 
research and development expenses 
research and development r d expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel engaged in engineering and r d activities  fees paid to consultants and outside service providers  nonrecurring engineering charges  prototyping expenses related to the design  development  testing and enhancement of our products  depreciation related to engineering and test equipment  and it and facilities expenses 
for the year ended october   r d expenses decreased by million  or eight percent  to million  compared with million for the year ended october  this decrease is primarily due to a million decrease in salaries and head count related expenses as a result of the restructuring programs we implemented in the second quarter of fiscal year  partially offset by a million increase in outside service providers due to continued investment in offshore research and development 
in addition  r d expenses decreased by million due to lower stock compensation expense in the year ended october  primarily as a result of changes in the market value of our common stock 
further  the decrease in r d expenses reflects the effect of the extra week in the second quarter of fiscal year for the year ended october   r d expenses decreased by million  or three percent  to million  compared with million for the year ended october  this decrease is primarily due to a million decrease in salaries and related expenses and a million decrease in facilities expenses due to savings from our building purchase  partially offset by a million increase in expenses related to consulting and new product development spending  including costs associated with new silkworm products we introduced during the second half of fiscal year the decrease in salaries and related expenses reflects the effects of our restructuring programs  partially offset by incremental expenses related to the extra week in the second quarter of fiscal year in addition  r d expenses increased by million due to higher stock compensation expense in the year ended october  primarily as a result of changes in the market value of our common stock 
excluding any stock option compensation related charges  which will vary depending on the changes in the market value of our common stock  we currently anticipate that r d expenses in fiscal year will increase in absolute dollars as a result of investments in tapestry products and other new technologies 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and sales  costs associated with promotional and travel expenses  and it and facilities expenses 
for the year ended october   sales and marketing expenses decreased by million  or one percent  to million  compared with million for the year ended october  this decrease is primarily due to a million decrease in salaries and head count related expenses  including lower commissions expenses due to lower revenues  and a million decrease in stock compensation expense primarily due to compensation for certain employees on leaves of absences and in transition or advisory roles in the year ended october   partially offset by a million increase in sales and marketing program expenses 
in addition  the decrease in sales and marketing expenses reflects the effect of the extra week in the second quarter of fiscal year for the year ended october   sales and marketing expenses decreased by million  or percent  to million  compared with million for the year ended october  this decrease is primarily due to a million decrease in travel and marketing program expenses resulting from various cost cutting actions and a million decrease in salaries and related expenses  which reflects the effect of headcount reductions that occurred in the fiscal years and  partially offset by incremental expenses related to the extra week in the second quarter of fiscal year in addition  sales and marketing expenses increased by million due to higher stock compensation expense in the year ended october  primarily due to compensation for certain employees on leaves of absences and in transition or advisory roles 

table of contents excluding any stock option compensation related charges  which will vary depending on the changes in the market value of our common stock  we currently anticipate that sales and marketing expenses in fiscal year will increase in absolute dollars as a result of additional costs to support tapestry products and brocade services 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative g a expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for corporate executives  finance  human resources and investor relations  as well as recruiting expenses  professional fees  corporate legal expenses  other corporate expenses  and it and facilities expenses 
g a expenses for the year ended october  increased by million  or two percent  to million  compared with million for the year ended october  the increase in g a for fiscal year is primarily due to a million increase in professional service fees  partially offset by a million decrease in stock compensation expense primarily as a result of changes in the market value of our common stock 
for the year ended october   g a expenses increased by million  or percent  compared with million for the year ended october  the increase in g a for fiscal year is primarily due to increased salaries and related expenses as a result of an increase in personnel 
in addition  in fiscal year we incurred incremental expenses related to the extra week in the second quarter of fiscal year  as well as expenses related to section of the sarbanes oxley act of further  for the year ended october  g a expenses increased by million due to higher stock compensation expense in the year ended october  primarily as a result of changes in the market value of our common stock 
excluding any stock option compensation related charges  which will vary depending on the changes in the market value of our common stock  we currently anticipate that g a expenses in fiscal year will increase in absolute dollars resulting from the cost to support tapestry products and brocade services 
internal review and sec investigation costs 
on january   we announced that our audit committee completed an internal review regarding historical stock option granting practices 
following the january audit committee internal review  on may   we announced that additional information had come to our attention that indicated that certain guidelines regarding stock option granting practices were not followed and our audit committee had commenced an internal review of our stock option accounting focusing on leaves of absence and transition and advisory roles 
our audit committee review was completed in november in addition  we are undergoing an sec and department of justice doj joint investigation regarding our historical stock option granting practices 
as a result  for the year ended october   we recorded million for professional service fees related to the completed internal reviews and ongoing sec investigation 
we did not incur any internal review or sec investigation costs during the years ended october  or october  settlement of an acquisition related claim 
in the second quarter of fiscal year  we recorded a million charge in settlement of a claim relating to our acquisition of rhapsody networks  inc rhapsody 
under the terms of the settlement  in the third quarter of fiscal year we issued million shares of common stock to the former rhapsody shareholders in exchange for a release of claims 
amortization of deferred stock compensation 
amortization of deferred stock compensation was million  million  and million for the years ended october   october   and october   respectively 
amortization of deferred stock compensation includes stock compensation expenses related to our acquisitions of rhapsody and therion software corporation therion 
the deferred stock compensation represents the intrinsic value of unvested restricted common stock and assumed stock options  and is amortized over the respective remaining service periods on a straight line basis 
as of october   the remaining unamortized balance of deferred stock compensation related to the therion acquisition was approximately million and the deferred stock compensation related to the rhapsody acquisition has been substantially amortized 
in addition to the deferred stock compensation connected with our acquisitions of rhapsody and therion  we have recorded deferred stock compensation arising from stock option grants subject to variable accounting  change in measurement dates and restricted stock award grants to certain employees 
compensation expense resulting from these non acquisition related grants are included in cost of revenues  r d  sales and marketing  or g a  based on 
table of contents the department of the employee receiving the award 
accordingly  amortization of deferred stock compensation does not include the compensation expense arising from these awards 
total stock based compensation expense recognized for the years ended october   october   and october  was million  million and million  respectively 
stock based compensation expense related to stock options subject to variable accounting will vary significantly as a result of future changes in the market value of our common stock 
in addition  we will recognize additional stock based compensation expense beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year as a result of implementation of sfas r  accounting for stock based compensation 
restructuring costs reversals 
restructuring costs reversals for the years ended october   october   and october  were million  million  and million  respectively 
for the year ended october   we recorded a reduction of million to restructuring costs related to recovery of previously recorded restructuring costs 
for the year ended october   restructuring costs consist of million related to a restructuring plan implemented during the three months ended may   and a reduction of million to restructuring costs related to our previously recorded restructuring liabilities  primarily due to lower than expected costs related to outplacement costs and severance see note  restructuring costs  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
for the year ended october   restructuring costs consisted of million related to a program to restructure and reorganize certain business operations during the three months ended april   and million related to a company wide restructuring program implemented during the three months ended january  in process research and development 
on may   we completed our acquisition of therion  a privately held company based in redmond  washington that developed software management solutions for the automated provisioning of servers over a storage network 
as of the acquisition date  therion was a development stage company with no recognized revenue and a core technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility 
accordingly  the acquisition of therion was accounted for as an asset purchase 
in connection with this acquisition  we recorded a million in process research and development charge  and allocated the remaining purchase price to net assets of million  deferred stock compensation of million  and net liabilities of million  based on fair values see note  acquisitions  of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements 
on january   we completed our acquisition of rhapsody  a provider of next generation intelligent switching platforms 
as of the acquisition date  rhapsody was a development stage company that had no recognized revenue and a core technology that required substantial additional resources to bring it to technological feasibility 
therefore  we accounted for the acquisition as an asset purchase and allocated the total purchase price of million to the assets acquired  liabilities assumed  and acquired in process r d based on their respective fair values 
we allocated the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets received to acquired in process r d and acquired non monetary assets on a pro rata basis 
we expensed the acquired in process r d of million during the three months ended april  because it had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use see note  acquisitions  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we completed the development of this technology in fiscal year we did not record any acquired in process r d for the year ended october  lease termination charge and other  net 
lease termination charge and other  net for the year ended october  was million 
during the three months ended january   we purchased a previously leased building located near our san jose headquarters for million 
of the million  million was allocated to the purchase of land and building and million was considered a lease termination fee see note  liabilities associated with facilities lease losses and asset impairment charges  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
no lease termination charge was recorded in any of the other periods presented 
interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net increased to million for the year ended october   compared to million for the year ended october  and million for the year ended october  for the year ended october   the increase was primarily due to higher average rates of return due to investment mix and increase in interest rates  as well as increased average cash  cash equivalent  restricted short term investments and short term and long term investment balances 
for the year ended october  
table of contents  the increase was primarily as a result of higher average rates of return due to investment mix and increase in interest rates  offset by decreased average cash  cash equivalent and investment balances 
interest expense 
interest expense was million  million and million for the years ended october   october  and october   respectively 
interest expense primarily represents the interest cost associated with our convertible subordinated debt 
the decrease in interest expense for both the years ended october  and october   compared with the year ended october  was primarily the result of the repurchases of our convertible subordinated debt  resulting in a lower debt outstanding 
as of october  and october   the outstanding balance of our convertible subordinated debt was million and million  respectively see note  convertible subordinated debt  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
gain on repurchases of convertible subordinated debt 
during the years ended october   october   and october   we repurchased million  million  and million in face value of our convertible subordinated debt  respectively  on the open market 
for the year ended october   we paid an average of for each dollar of face value for an aggregate purchase price of million  which resulted in a pre tax gain of million 
for the year ended october   we paid an average of for each dollar of face value for an aggregate purchase price of million  which resulted in a pre tax gain of million 
for the year ended october   we paid an average of for each dollar of face value for an aggregate purchase price of million  which resulted in a pre tax gain of million 
gain loss on investments  net 
for the year ended october   net loss on investments was million  consisting of million losses on the disposition of portfolio investments primarily associated with the defeasance of the indenture agreement relating to our convertible notes  offset by million gains on the disposition of non marketable private strategic investments 
for the year ended october   net gain on investments was million consisting of gains on the disposition of previously written down non marketable private strategic investments 
for the year ended october   net gain on investments of million consisting of gains on the disposition of previously written down non marketable private strategic investments of million  offset by an impairment charge of million that resulted from an other than temporary decline in the estimated fair value of a minority equity investment in a different non publicly traded company 
as of october  and october   we had net unrealized holding gains losses of million and million  respectively  associated with our remaining investment portfolio 
the carrying value of our equity investments in non publicly traded companies at october  and october  was million and million  respectively 
provision for income taxes 
estimates and judgments are required in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets  which arise from variable stock option expenses  net operating losses  tax carryforwards and temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  also requires that the deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance  if based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  in full or in part  we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results  the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent fiscal years and our forecast of future taxable income on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 
in determining future taxable income  we are responsible for assumptions utilized including the amount of state and federal pre tax operating income  the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgments about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses 
cumulative losses incurred in four of the last seven fiscal years represented sufficient negative evidence to require a full valuation allowance 
as of october   we had a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets  which we intend to maintain until sufficient positive evidence exists to support reversal of the valuation allowance 
future reversals or increases to our valuation allowance could have a significant impact on our future earnings 

table of contents in addition  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions 
we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
if events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary  the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 
if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  a further charge to expense would result 
in the year ended october   we have recorded an income tax provision of million  compared to income tax provision of million and million in the years ended october  and october   respectively 
for the year ended october   our income tax provision is primarily for our international operations  a one time us tax liability associated with the earnings repatriated pursuant to the american jobs creation act of the ajca  and domestic operations 
we expect to continue to record an income tax provision for our international and domestic operations in the future 
since we have a full valuation allowance against deferred tax assets which result from us operations  us income tax expense or benefits are offset by releasing or increasing  respectively  the valuation allowance 
our us federal income tax liability is reduced by the utilization of net operating loss and credit carry forwards from prior years such that only alternative minimum tax results 
to the extent these carryforwards are fully utilized against future earnings  our us federal effective tax rate is expected to increase 
to the extent that international revenues and earnings differ from those historically achieved  a factor largely influenced by the buying behavior of our oem partners  or unfavorable changes in tax laws and regulations occur  our income tax provision could change 
the ajca was enacted on october  one provision of the ajca effectively reduces the tax rate on qualifying repatriation of earnings held by foreign based subsidiaries to approximately percent 
normally  such repatriations would be taxed at a rate of up to percent 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we made the decision that we would repatriate approximately million under the ajca 
this repatriation of earnings triggered a us federal tax payment of approximately million and a state tax payment of approximately million 
these amounts are reflected in our current income tax expense 
prior to the ajca  we did not provide deferred taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as we intended to utilize these earnings through expansion of our business operations outside the united states for an indefinite period of time 
going forward  we intend to indefinitely reinvest prospective foreign earnings 
in november  we were notified by the internal revenue service that our domestic federal income tax return for the year ended october  was subject to audit 
we believe we have adequate reserves to cover any potential assessments that may result from the examination 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents  restricted short term investments  and short term and long term investments were million as of october   an increase of million over the prior year total of million 
for the year ended october   we generated million in cash from operating activities 
cash from operations significantly exceeded net income for the year ended october  due to non cash expense items  primarily related to depreciation and amortization and a decrease in accounts receivable 
days sales outstanding in receivables for the year ended october  was days 
net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended october  totaled million and was primarily the result of million in net proceeds from sales and maturities of short and long term investments and other non marketable investments  partially offset by million cash used for purchases of restricted short term investments related to the defeasance of the indenture agreement relating to our convertible notes  million invested in capital equipment  and million cash used in connection with an acquisition 
net cash used in financing activities for the year ended october  totaled million 
net cash used in financing activities was primarily the result of million cash used for repurchases of our convertible subordinated debt and million cash used to repurchase our common stock under the stock repurchase program approved in august by our board of directors  partially offset by million in net proceeds from employee participation in employee stock programs and exercises of stock options 

table of contents net proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to employee participation in employee stock programs have historically been a significant component of our liquidity 
the extent to which our employees participate in these programs generally increases or decreases based upon changes in the market price of our common stock 
as a result  our cash flow resulting from the issuance of common stock related to employee participation in employee stock programs will vary 
as a result of our voluntary stock options exchange program  which was completed in july  we do not expect to generate significant cash flow from the issuance of common stock related to the employee participation in employee stock programs during fiscal year unless our future common stock price exceeds per share  which is the exercise price of the stock options granted under the exchange program 
we have a manufacturing agreement with foxconn under which we provide twelve month product forecasts and place purchase orders in advance of the scheduled delivery of products to our customers 
the required lead time for placing orders with foxconn depends on the specific product 
as of october   our aggregate commitment to foxconn for inventory components used in the manufacture of brocade products was million  net of purchase commitment reserves of million  which we expect to utilize during future normal ongoing operations 
although the purchase orders we place with foxconn are cancelable  the terms of the agreement requires us to purchase from foxconn all inventory components not returnable or usable by  or sold to  other customers of foxconn 
our purchase commitments reserve reflects our estimate of purchase commitments we do not expect to consume in normal operations 
on december   and january   we sold an aggregate of million in principal amount of two percent convertible subordinated notes due january the notes or convertible subordinated debt see note  convertible subordinated debt  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
holders of the notes may  in whole or in part  convert the notes into shares of our common stock at a conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of notes approximately million shares may be issued upon conversion based on outstanding debt of million as of october  at any time prior to maturity on january   subject to earlier redemption 
under the original term of the notes  at any time on or after january   we were entitled to redeem the notes in whole or in part at the following prices expressed as a percentage of the principal amount redemption period price beginning on january  and ending on december  beginning on january  and ending on december  on january  we are required to pay interest on january and july of each year  beginning july  debt issuance costs are being amortized over the term of the notes 
the amortization of debt issuance costs will accelerate upon early redemption  repurchase  or conversion of the notes 
the net proceeds remain available for general corporate purposes  including working capital and capital expenditures 
during fiscal years and  the company repurchased on the open market million and million in face value of its convertible subordinated debt  respectively 
for the year ended october   the company paid an average of for each dollar of face value for an aggregate purchase price of million  which resulted in a pre tax gain of million 
for the year ended october   the company paid an average of for each dollar of face value for an aggregate purchase price of million  which resulted in a pre tax gain of million 
as of october   the remaining balance outstanding of the convertible subordinated debt was million 
on august   in accordance with the terms of the indenture agreement dated december  with respect to the convertible subordinated debt  the company elected to deposit securities with the trustee of the notes the trustee  which fully collateralized the outstanding notes  and to discharge the indenture agreement 
pursuant to this election  the company provided an irrevocable letter of instruction to the trustee to issue a notice of redemption on june  and to redeem the notes on august  the redemption date 
over the course of the next year  the trustee  using the securities deposited with them  will pay to the noteholders all the interest scheduled to become due per the original note prior to the redemption date  and all the principal and remaining interest  plus a call premium of of the face value of the notes  on the redemption date 
as of october   the company had an aggregate of million in interest bearing us securities with the 
table of contents trustee 
the securities will remain on the company s balance sheet as restricted short term investments until the redemption date 
the company recorded a loss on investments of million in the three months ended october  with respect to the disposition of certain short term and long term investments that was necessary to deposit the securities with the trustee 
on november   we purchased a previously leased building located near our san jose headquarters  and issued a million guarantee as part of the purchase agreements 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations including interest expense and commitments as of october  in thousands less than more than total year years years years contractual obligations convertible subordinated notes  including interest non cancelable operating leases purchase commitments  gross total contractual obligations other commitments standby letters of credit  n a n a n a n a guarantee  n a n a n a n a amount reflects total gross purchase commitments under our manufacturing agreement with foxconn 
of this amount  we have reserved million for estimated purchase commitments that we do not expect to consume in normal operations 
share repurchase program 
in august  our board of directors approved a share repurchase program for up to million of our common stock 
the purchases may be made  from time to time  in the open market and will be funded from available working capital 
the number of shares to be purchased and the timing of purchases will be based on the level of our cash balances  general business and market conditions  and other factors  including alternative investment opportunities 
to date  we have repurchased million shares and million remains available for future repurchases under this program 
equity investments 
under the terms of a certain investment agreement with a non publicly traded company  the company may be required to make additional investments of up to million if certain milestones are met 
in addition  the company signed a licensing agreement with the same company  under which it may be required to pay up to million of prepaid license fees if certain milestones are met 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents  short term and long term investments  and cash expected to be generated from future operations will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements at least through the next months  although we may elect to seek additional funding prior to that time  if available 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our rate of revenue growth  the timing and extent of spending to support our product development efforts and the expansion of our sales and marketing programs  the timing of introductions of new products and enhancements to our existing products  and market acceptance of our products 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate  on an on going basis  our estimates and judgments  including those related to sales returns  bad debts  excess inventory and purchase commitments  investments  warranty obligations  restructuring costs  
table of contents lease losses  income taxes  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
the methods  estimates  and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results that we report in our consolidated financial statements 
the sec considers an entity s most critical accounting policies to be those policies that are both most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results of operations  and those that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain at the time of estimation 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  require significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition  and allowances for sales returns  sales programs  and doubtful accounts  stock based compensation  warranty reserves  inventory and purchase commitment reserves  restructuring charges and lease loss reserves  litigation costs  and accounting for income taxes 
revenue recognition  and allowances for sales returns  sales programs  and doubtful accounts 
product revenue is generally recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is probable 
however  for newly introduced products  many of our large oem customers require a product qualification period during which our products are tested and approved by the oem customer for sale to their customers 
revenue recognition  and related cost  is deferred for shipments to new oem customers and for shipments of newly introduced products to existing oem customers until satisfactory evidence of completion of the product qualification has been received from the oem customer 
in addition  revenue from sales to our master reseller customers is recognized in the same period in which the product is sold by the master reseller sell through 
we reduce revenue for estimated sales returns  sales programs  and other allowances at the time of shipment 
sales returns  sales programs  and other allowances are estimated based on historical experience  current trends  and our expectations regarding future experience 
reductions to revenue associated with sales returns  sales programs  and other allowances include consideration of historical sales levels  the timing and magnitude of historical sales returns  claims under sales programs  and other allowances  and a projection of this experience into the future 
in addition  we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts  which are also accounted for as a reduction in revenue  for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we analyze accounts receivable  historical collection patterns  customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends  changes in customer payment terms and practices  and customer communication when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if actual sales returns  sales programs  and other allowances exceed our estimate  or if the financial condition of our customers was to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances and charges may be required 
service revenue consists of training  warranty  and maintenance arrangements  including post contract customer support pcs services 
pcs services are offered under renewable  annual fee based contracts or as part of multiple element arrangements and typically include upgrades and enhancements to our software operating system software  and telephone support

we allocate revenue to each element based upon vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of the fair value of the element or  if vsoe is not available  by application of the residual method 
vsoe of the fair value for an element is based upon the price charged when the element is sold separately

stock based compensation 
the company accounts for its stock option plans and its employee stock purchase plan in accordance with the provisions of accounting principles board opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees  apb  whereby the difference between the exercise price and the fair market value on the date of grant is recognized as compensation expense 
under the intrinsic value method of accounting  no compensation expense is recognized in the company s consolidated statements of operations when the exercise price of the company s employee stock option grants equals the market price of the underlying common stock on the date of grant  and the measurement date of the option grant is certain 
the measurement date is certain when the date of grant is fixed and determinable 
when the measurement date is not certain  then the company records stock compensation expense using variable accounting under apb when variable accounting is applied to stock option grants  the company remeasures the intrinsic value of the options at the end of each reporting period or until the options are exercised  cancelled or expire unexercised 
compensation expense in any given period is calculated as the difference between total earned compensation at the end of the period  less total earned compensation at the beginning of the period 
compensation earned is calculated under an accelerated vesting method in accordance with fasb interpretation as a result  changes in stock prices will change the intrinsic value of the options and compensation expense or benefit recognized in any given period 
warranty reserves 
we provide warranties on our products ranging from one to three years 
estimated future warranty costs are accrued at the time of shipment and charged to cost of revenues based upon historical experience  current trends and our expectations regarding future experience 
if actual warranty costs exceed our estimate  additional charges may be required 
inventory and purchase commitment reserves 
we write down inventory and record purchase commitment reserves for estimated excess and obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated fair value based upon forecast of future product demand  product transition cycles  and market conditions 
although we strive to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and commitments  and our reported results 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected  additional inventory write downs  purchase commitment reserves  and charges against earnings might be required 
restructuring charges and lease loss reserves 
we monitor and regularly evaluate our organizational structure and associated operating expenses 
depending on events and circumstances  we may decide to take additional actions to reduce future operating costs as our business requirements evolve 
in determining restructuring charges  we analyze our future operating requirements  including the required headcount by business functions and facility space requirements 
our restructuring costs  and any resulting accruals  involve significant estimates made by management using the best information available at the time the estimates are made  some of which may be provided by third parties 
in recording severance reserves  we accrue liability when all of the following conditions have been met employees rights to receive compensation for future absences is attributable to employees services already rendered  the obligation relates to rights that vest or accumulate  payment of the compensation is probable  and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
in recording facilities lease loss reserves  we make various assumptions  including the time period over which the facilities are expected to be vacant  expected sublease terms  expected sublease rates  anticipated future operating expenses  and expected future use of the facilities 
our estimates involve a number of risks and uncertainties  some of which are beyond our control  including future real estate market conditions and our ability to successfully enter into subleases or lease termination agreements with terms as favorable as those assumed when arriving at our estimates 
we regularly evaluate a number of factors to determine the appropriateness and reasonableness of our restructuring and lease loss accruals including the various assumptions noted above 
if actual results differ significantly from our estimates  we may be required to adjust our restructuring and lease loss accruals in the future 

table of contents litigation costs 
we are subject to the possibility of legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business 
we regularly monitor the status of pending legal actions to evaluate both the magnitude and likelihood of any potential loss 
we accrue for these potential losses when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss  or possible range of loss  can be reasonably estimated 
if actual results differ significantly from our estimates  we may be required to adjust our accruals in the future 
accounting for income taxes 
the determination of our tax provision is subject to judgments and estimates due to operations in multiple tax jurisdictions inside and outside the united states 
sales to our international customers are principally taxed at rates that are lower than the united states statutory rates 
the ability to maintain our current effective tax rate is contingent upon existing tax laws in both the united states and in the respective countries in which our international subsidiaries are located 
future changes in domestic or international tax laws could affect the continued realization of the tax benefits we are currently receiving and expect to receive from international sales 
in addition  an increase in the percentage of our total revenue from international customers or in the mix of international revenue among particular tax jurisdictions could change our overall effective tax rate 
also  our current effective tax rate assumes that united states income taxes are not provided for undistributed earnings of certain non united states subsidiaries 
these earnings could become subject to united states federal and state income taxes and foreign withholding taxes  as applicable  should they be either deemed or actually remitted from our international subsidiaries to the united states 
the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets is subject to a full valuation allowance 
at some point in the future  the company may have sufficient united states taxable income to release the valuation allowance and accrue united states tax 
we evaluate the expected realization of our deferred tax assets and assess the need for valuation allowances quarterly
