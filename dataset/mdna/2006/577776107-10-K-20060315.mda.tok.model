item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report 
this report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those indicated in forward looking statements 
see forward looking statements and risk factors 
executive summary we are a biotechnology company committed to the discovery  development and commercialization of superior next generation protein pharmaceuticals for the treatment of disease and serious medical conditions 
we began operations in march with the mission to develop important commercial products through the use of biotechnology 
since then  we have established a focus in human therapeutics  particularly on the development and commercialization of optimized protein pharmaceuticals 
our business strategy focuses on developing next generation protein pharmaceuticals that address significant markets  on our own or with collaborative partners 
we currently have four next generation product candidates that are in pre clinical development maxy g  a next generation granulocyte colony stimulating factor  or g csf  for the treatment of neutropenia  maxy alpha  a next generation interferon alpha product for the treatment of hepatitis c virus infection  maxy vii  an improved factor vii product for the treatment of uncontrolled bleeding in trauma  intracerebral hemorrhage and other indications  and maxy gamma  an optimized interferon gamma product for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and other indications 
we currently expect that filings will be made in with the us food drug administration  or fda  or other regulatory agencies for approval to commence clinical development of our maxy g and maxy alpha product candidates 
the successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain 
product development costs and timelines can vary significantly for each product candidate and are difficult to accurately predict 
various statutes and regulations also govern or influence the manufacturing  safety  labeling  storage  record keeping and marketing of each product 
the lengthy process of seeking all necessary approvals to commercialize products  and the subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations  require the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals would materially adversely affect our business 
prior to our focus on human therapeutics  we established two industrial subsidiaries  codexis  inc  or codexis  and verdia  inc  or verdia 
codexis focused on the development of biocatalysis and fermentation processes and products for the pharmaceutical industry and verdia focused on the development of processes and products for the agricultural industry 
on february   our voting rights in codexis were reduced below 
as a result  we no longer consolidate the financial position and results of operations of codexis with our financial results as of such date and instead account for codexis under the equity method of accounting 
to reflect what our basis in codexis would have been under equity accounting  we recorded a cumulative effect adjustment of million for the year ended december  to bring our investment basis in codexis to zero as of february  on july   we completed the sale of verdia  our agriculture subsidiary  to pioneer hi bred international  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of ei du pont de nemours and company  for cash proceeds of million 
the discussion in this section reflects the results of verdia as a discontinued operation for the years ended december  and to date  we have generated revenues from research collaborations with pharmaceutical  chemical and petroleum companies and from government grants 
moving forward  we anticipate establishing additional strategic alliances 
however  as our internal resources and expertise have evolved  we have strategically shifted our focus to pharmaceutical products and internal product development in order to capture more of the potential value resulting from our efforts 
we believe this is an important step in building long term value in our company 

table of contents consistent with our strategic shift  revenue from collaborative research agreements and government grants decreased from million in to million in and to million in however  we expect our revenue for to increase compared to  due primarily to collaborative research and development revenue we expect to receive from our collaboration with roche for our maxy vii product candidates  which became effective in december  and an increase in activity on our existing grant projects 
for the purposes of this report  our continuing operations consist of the results of maxygen  inc and its wholly owned subsidiaries  maxygen aps denmark and maxygen holdings ltd 
cayman islands  as well as the results of codexis through february  we continue to maintain a strong cash position to fund our expanded internal product development  with cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling million as of december  we have incurred significant operating losses since our inception 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was million 
we have invested heavily in establishing our proprietary technologies 
our research and development expenses from continuing operations for were million  compared to million for and million for we expect to incur additional operating losses over at least the next several years 
critical accounting policies and estimates general the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make judgments  estimates and assumptions in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following are our critical accounting policies  including those that reflect the more significant judgments  estimates and assumptions we make in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
consolidation the consolidated financial statements presented in this report include the amounts of us and our wholly owned subsidiaries  maxygen aps denmark and maxygen holdings ltd 
cayman islands 
for the years ended december  and and for the two months ended february   of the results of operations of codexis are also included  as well as the financial position of codexis at december  as of february   primarily as a result of the issuance of codexis common stock in connection with the acquisition by codexis of julich fine chemicals gmbh  our voting rights in codexis were reduced below 
as a result  we no longer consolidate the financial position and results of operations of codexis with our financial results as of such date 
in accordance with eitf consensus  investor accounting for an investee when the investor has a majority of the voting interest but the minority stockholder or stockholders have certain approval or veto rights and paragraph of arb no 
 consolidated financial statements  we have included of the net losses of codexis in the determination of our net loss through february  in accordance with apb  the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock  we are accounting for our investment in codexis under the equity method of accounting after february  we are not obligated to provide additional funding to codexis 
the operations of verdia  inc  prior to its sale on july   are reflected as discontinued operations 
all significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
on july   we formed avidia inc formerly avidia research institute  or avidia  together with a third party investor 
in conjunction with its initial capitalization  we contributed certain technology to avidia and invested  in cash 
during  we provided a series of loans to avidia in the aggregate amount of 
table of contents million 
this loan converted into equity securities of avidia in as of december   our ownership in avidia was approximately  based upon the voting rights of the issued and outstanding shares of avidia s common and preferred stock 
until march   our investment in avidia was accounted for under the equity method of accounting and our share of its results was recorded to the extent of our accounting basis in avidia as a component of equity in net loss of minority investee in the consolidated statements of operations 
in april  avidia issued additional equity securities  which lowered our ownership below 
since we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over avidia s operating and financial policies  after march   our investment in avidia is being accounted for under the cost method of accounting 
as of december  and  we had recorded losses equal to our investment basis in avidia 
we are not obligated to provide additional funding to avidia 
goodwill and intangible impairment in connection with our acquisition of maxygen aps in  we allocated million to goodwill and other intangible assets 
prior to adoption of statement of financial accounting standard no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  or sfas  we amortized a portion of the goodwill each year 
as of december   the net goodwill balance was million 
at this time  goodwill and other intangible assets are generally evaluated on an individual acquisition or market basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such assets are impaired or the estimated useful lives are no longer appropriate 
in accordance with sfas  we review our long lived assets including goodwill for impairment at least annually based on estimated future discounted cash flows attributable to the assets and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
in the event such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the recorded value of the assets  the assets will be written down to their estimated fair values 
no impairment charges were recorded in  or the valuation in connection with the initial purchase price allocation and the ongoing evaluation for impairment of goodwill and intangible assets requires significant management estimates and judgment 
the purchase price allocation process requires management estimates and judgment as to expectations for various products and business strategies 
if any of the significant assumptions differ from the estimates and judgments used in the purchase price allocation  this could result in different valuations for goodwill and intangible assets 
once it is established  we must test goodwill annually for impairment using a two step process as required by sfas in addition  in certain circumstances  we must assess if goodwill should be tested for impairment between annual tests 
intangible assets with definite useful lives must be tested for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
when we conduct our impairment tests for goodwill and intangibles  factors that are considered important in determining whether impairment might exist include existing product portfolio  product development cycle  development expenses  potential royalties and product sales  costs of goods and selling expenses and overall product lifecycle 
any changes in key assumptions about the business and its prospects  or changes in market conditions or other external events  could result in an impairment charge and such a charge could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations 
source of revenue and revenue recognition policy we recognize revenues from research collaboration agreements as earned upon our achievement of the performance requirements of the agreements 
our existing corporate collaboration agreements generally provide for research funding for a specified number of full time equivalent researchers working in defined research programs 
revenue related to these payments is earned as the related research work is performed 
in addition  these collaborators may make technology advancement payments that are intended to fund further development of our core technology  as opposed to a defined research program 
such payments are recognized ratably over the related research and development period 
payments received that are related to future performance are deferred and recognized as revenue as the performance requirements are achieved 
as of december   we have deferred revenues of approximately million that we expect to recognize over approximately the next six years 

table of contents revenue related to performance milestones is recognized based upon the achievement of the milestones  as defined in the respective agreements 
substantive  at risk incentive milestones  if any  are recognized as revenue upon achievement of the incentive milestone event when we have no future performance obligations related to the payment and we judge the event to be the culmination of a separate earnings process 
incentive milestone payments are triggered either by the results of our research efforts or by events external to us  such as regulatory approval to market a product 
we receive royalties from licensees  which are based on sales to third parties of licensed products 
royalties are recorded as earned in accordance with the contract terms when third party results can be reliably measured and collectibility is reasonably assured 
non refundable up front payments received in connection with research and development collaboration agreements  including technology advancement funding that is intended for the development of our core technology  are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the relevant periods specified in the agreement  generally the research term  or recognized ratably over the research term based on planned levels of research services in cases where the planned levels of research services fluctuate substantially over the research term 
the determination of separate units of accounting in arrangements involving multiple deliverables as required under eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  requires management to exercise judgment as to whether the delivered item has stand alone value to the collaborator and to estimate whether there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value for the undelivered items 
our collaborative agreements may contain multiple deliverables that require management to determine whether or not the deliverables are separate units of accounting 
revenue related to grant agreements with various government agencies is recognized as the related research and development expenses are incurred  and when these research and development expenses are within the prior approved funding amounts 
certain grant agreements provide an option for the government to audit the amount of research and development expenses  both direct and indirect  that have been submitted to the government agency for reimbursement 
we believe the overhead rates we used to calculate our indirect research and development expenses are within the contractual guidelines of allowable costs and are reasonable estimates of our indirect expenses incurred through the term of the agreements 
our sources of potential revenues for the next several years are likely to be license fees  research funding and milestone payments under existing and possible future collaborative arrangements and government research grants 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
stock based compensation expense stock based compensation expense for options granted to employees has been determined as the intrinsic value of any stock options granted with exercise prices below the fair value of the common stock on the date of grant 
compensation expense for options granted to consultants has been determined in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for stock based compensation  or sfas  and emerging issues task force issue no 
accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  or eitf  as the fair value of the equity instruments issued 
compensation expense for related options granted to consultants is periodically remeasured as the underlying options vest 

table of contents in connection with the grant of stock options to employees before our initial public offering  we recorded deferred stock compensation of approximately million in and million in these amounts were initially recorded as a component of stockholders equity and were amortized as charges to operations over the vesting period of the options using a graded vesting method 
we recognized stock compensation expense related to the deferred compensation amortization on these option grants  which relate to research and development expense and general and administrative expense  as shown in the following table in thousands research and development general and administrative as of december   we had fully amortized to expense all deferred compensation relating to pre ipo grants of stock options to employees 
in connection with our acquisition of maxygen aps in august  stock options were granted in exchange for outstanding warrants to purchase maxygen aps securities 
in connection with this exchange  we recorded aggregate deferred compensation totaling million 
this amount was amortized over the remaining vesting period of the options  of which  was expensed in this deferred compensation was fully amortized to expense as of december  also in connection with the maxygen aps acquisition  maxygen shares were exchanged for maxygen aps shares 
for the shares exchanged that had a right of repurchase  we recorded deferred compensation of million 
this amount was amortized to expense over a three year graded vesting period 
a total of  was recognized as expense in this deferred compensation was fully amortized to expense as of december  in connection with the grant of stock options to consultants  we recorded stock compensation expense of  in   in and  in  which were included in research and development expense  and  in and  in which were included in general and administrative expense 
we did not record any stock compensation expense in connection with the grant of stock options to consultants in included in general and administrative expense 
results of operations revenues our total revenues from continuing operations were million in  compared to million in and million in our revenues are derived primarily from research collaboration agreements and government research grants 
revenues from our research collaboration agreements were million  million and million in  and  respectively  and revenues from government research grants were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease in collaborative research and development revenue of million from to was primarily due to the completion of the research and development funding terms of several collaborations during and and the deconsolidation of codexis as of february  this decrease was offset  in part  by the achievement of significant milestones from roche totaling million with regard to our alpha interferon product candidates 
the increase in grant revenue of million from to primarily reflects an increase in activity due to the beginning of three new government grant projects in the third quarter of the decrease in collaborative research and development revenue of million from to was primarily due to a decrease in partner funding as the funded research terms of our collaborations with lundbeck and alk abell a s  and codexis collaboration with chevron  wound down on schedule  partially offset by additional revenue from codexis collaboration with pfizer  which commenced in the third quarter of  and a full year of revenue from our collaboration with roche on our alpha interferon product candidates 
the decline in grant revenue of  from to primarily reflects the recognition of grant revenue in for a one time study 

table of contents we expect our revenue for to increase compared to  due primarily to collaborative research and development revenue we expect to receive from our collaboration with roche for our factor vii product candidates  which became effective in december  and an increase in activity on our existing grant projects 
however  due to the nature of our research  our dependence on our collaborative partners to commercialize certain results of the research and our continuing shift to internal product development  our revenue may fluctuate substantially from year to year  based on the completion of new licensing or collaborative agreements and the achievement of development related milestones 
as a result  due to the uncertain nature of the events generating the revenue  we cannot predict with any certainty whether we will receive future milestone payments or royalty payments under our collaborations or whether any particular collaboration or research effort will ultimately result in a commercial product 
prior to our deconsolidation of codexis  as of february   we operated as two segments  human therapeutics and chemicals 
revenues for each operating segment were derived from our research collaboration agreements and government research grants and were categorized based on the industry of the product or technology under development 
results of codexis through february  are shown as our chemicals segment 
after february   we have operated as one segment  human therapeutics 
the following table presents revenues for each operating segment in thousands year ended december  human therapeutics chemicals through february  total revenue the increased revenue for our human therapeutics segment from to primarily reflects the achievement of significant milestones from roche in the first and fourth quarters of  totaling million  partially offset by the shift in focus of our product development strategy towards internal development of product candidates and away from third party funded research collaborations as several of our collaborations came to completion during and the decreased revenue for our human therapeutics segment from to primarily reflects the scheduled winding down of the funded research terms of our collaborations with lundbeck and alk abell a s  offset in part by collaborative research and development revenue from our collaboration with roche for our alpha interferon product candidates  which began in july we expect revenue to increase in  primarily due to our recent collaboration with roche for our factor vii product candidates  which became effective in december  and the work that began on three new grants in the third quarter of during  roche was the only collaborative partner that contributed collaborative research revenue to our human therapeutics segment 
the funded research term of our collaboration with roche for our alpha interferon product candidates ended in december in december  we entered into a new collaboration with roche  which became effective in december  for co development and commercialization of our factor vii product candidates 
research and development expenses our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel related expenses  research consultants and external collaborative research expenses including contract manufacturing and research  facility costs  supplies and depreciation of facilities  and expensed laboratory equipment 
research and development expenses were million in  million in and million in the decrease of million in research and development expenses from to was primarily due to the deconsolidation of codexis  as of february   offset in part by increased external collaborative 
table of contents research expenses associated with the development of our product candidates  including the manufacture of product candidates in preparation for clinical trials and termination charges of  in related to a reduction in force of research and development personnel announced on june  excluding codexis  research and development expenses increased million  from million in to million in the million increase in research and development expenses from to was primarily due to increased expenditures associated with the development of our product candidates  including the manufacture of product candidates in preparation for clinical trials and the termination costs associated with discontinuing clinical development of our interferon beta program  which was terminated in stock compensation expenses included in research and development expenses decreased from million in to  in and to  in  primarily as a result of the amortization of deferred compensation relating to the grant of stock options to employees before our initial public offering  which was fully amortized to expense by august we have entered into a number of research and development collaborations to perform research for our collaborators 
the major collaborative agreements have similar contractual terms 
the agreements generally require us to devote a specified number of full time equivalent employees to the research efforts over defined terms generally ranging from three to five years 
we do not track fully burdened research and development costs by project 
however  we do estimate  based on full time equivalent personnel effort  the percentage of research and development efforts as measured in hours incurred  which approximates costs undertaken for projects funded by  on the one hand  our collaborators and government grants and  on the other hand  projects funded by us 
we believe that presenting our research and development expenses in these categories will provide our investors with meaningful information on how our resources are being used 
the following table presents our approximate research and development expenses by funding category in thousands year ended december  collaborative projects funded by third parties internal projects total as we do not track fully burdened research and development costs by project  the expense figures provided above are comprised of the number of hours expended in each category multiplied by the approximate cost per hour of research and development effort 
in addition  project specific external costs are added to these costs 
our product development programs are at an early stage and may not result in any marketed products 
product candidates that may appear promising at early stages of development may not reach the market for a number of reasons 
product candidates may be found ineffective or cause harmful side effects during clinical trials  may take longer to pass through clinical trials than had been anticipated  may fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals and may prove impracticable to manufacture in commercial quantities at reasonable costs and with acceptable quality 
in addition  competitors may develop superior competing products 
furthermore  it is uncertain which of our internally developed product candidates will be subject to future collaborative arrangements 
the participation of a collaborative partner may accelerate the time to completion and reduce the cost to us of a product candidate or it may delay the time and increase the cost to us due to the alteration of our existing strategy 
the risks and uncertainties associated with our research and development projects are discussed more fully in the section of this report entitled item a risk factors 
because of these risks and uncertainties  we cannot predict when or whether we will successfully complete the development of our product candidates or the ultimate product development cost in any particular case 

table of contents we expect that our research and development costs will increase substantially in over  due primarily to an increase in research and development costs resulting from advancement our product candidates toward clinical development for the remainder of our consolidated operations 
we expect to continue to devote substantial resources to research and development and we expect research and development expenses to increase over the next several years if we are successful in advancing our product candidates into clinical trials 
to the extent we out license our product candidates prior to commencement of clinical trials or collaborate with others with respect to clinical trials  increases in research and development expenses may be reduced or avoided 
we intend to manage the level of our expenditures for research and development  including clinical trials  to balance advancing our product candidates against maintaining adequate cash resources for our operations 
we expect stock compensation expense related to research and development to increase considerably as a result of our implementation of sfas r 
we adopted sfas r as of january  and our implementation of sfas r is expected to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and net loss per share 
the impact of our implementation of sfas r will depend on  among other things  the levels of share based payments granted in the future 
general and administrative expenses our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for finance  human resources  business development  legal and general management  as well as insurance premiums and professional expenses  such as external expenditures for legal  accounting and commercial assessment of potential products 
general and administrative expenses were million in  compared to million in and million in general and administrative stock compensation expense was  in   in and  in the decrease in general and administrative expenses of million from to was primarily due to the deconsolidation of codexis  as of february   offset by an increase in professional fees related to an increase in market research and product profile development activity and regulatory compliance costs  as well as termination charges of  related to a reduction in force announced on june  excluding codexis  general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in the increase in general and administrative expenses from to was primarily due to increases in salaries and benefits and the expiration of certain benefits under our services agreements with codexis that required codexis to reimburse us for certain administrative expenses 
the increase in general and administrative stock compensation expenses from to was primarily due to the modification of the terms of certain employees stock options 
the increase in general and administrative expenses of million from to was primarily due to professional fees related to an increase in market research and product profile development activity  and regulatory compliance costs 
the decrease in general and administrative stock compensation expenses in compared to was primarily related to the amortization of deferred compensation relating to the grant of stock options to employees before our initial public offering  which was fully amortized to expense by august we expect that our general and administrative expenses may decrease slightly in  due primarily to reduced personnel costs resulting from terminations in and the deconsolidation of codexis in we expect any decrease to be offset in part by increased professional fees and product assessment costs 
we expect that stock compensation expense related to general and administration expenses will increase considerably in as a result of our implementation of sfas r 
we adopted sfas r as of january  and expect that the implementation of sfas r will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and net loss per share 
the ongoing impact of our implementation of sfas r will depend on  among other things  the levels of share based payments granted in the future 

table of contents amortization of other intangible assets in connection with our acquisition of maxygen aps in  we allocated million to other intangible assets 
we amortized the purchased core technology over its estimated three year useful life 
such technology was fully amortized to expense by september and we recorded amortization expense of  in interest income and other expense  net interest income and other expense  net represents income earned on our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  net of interest expense on our equipment leases and currency transaction gains or losses related to the funding of our danish subsidiary  maxygen aps 
interest income and other expense  net was million in  compared to million in and million in included in these amounts are foreign exchange losses of  in and foreign exchange gains of  and million in and  respectively 
the increase in interest income and other expense  net from to was primarily due to higher interest income from higher average balances of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  and higher interest rates  offset in part by an increase in foreign exchange losses 
the decrease in interest income and other expense  net from to was primarily due to lower foreign exchange gains in compared with equity in losses of minority investee equity in losses of minority investee reflects our share of the net loss of avidia 
avidia was formed in july and  prior to march   was accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
after march   the company s investment in avidia is being accounted for under the cost method of accounting 
in  we invested  in avidia in exchange for series a convertible preferred stock 
in  we provided a million loan to avidia 
this loan had an interest rate of per annum and was converted into equity securities of avidia in as of december  and  we had recorded losses equal to our investment basis in avidia  which includes the loan to avidia in we are not obligated to provide additional funding to avidia 
cumulative effect adjustment codexis was formed in january and independently financed by us and several other investors in september and october of in august  codexis received additional equity funding from pfizer inc until february   we recognized of the operating results of codexis  even though we only owned a majority of the voting interests in codexis 
at such time  we had recorded cumulative losses of codexis in the amount of million  which was in excess of our investment basis of million 
on february   our voting rights in codexis were reduced below 
as a result  we no longer consolidate the financial position and results of operations of codexis with our financial results as of such date and instead account for codexis under the equity method of accounting 
to reflect what our basis in codexis would have been under equity accounting  we recorded a non recurring cumulative effect adjustment of million in to bring our investment basis in codexis to zero as of february  this cumulative effect adjustment does not have any tax consequences 
subsidiary preferred stock accretion as of october   codexis had sold million of codexis series b convertible preferred stock to investors  of which million was purchased by us and million was purchased by several unrelated investors 
the series b convertible preferred stock includes a redemption provision  which provides that the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of series b convertible preferred stock excluding the series b convertible preferred stock held by us and our affiliates  voting together as a separate class  may require codexis to redeem the series b convertible preferred stock 
the redemption price for each share will be payable in cash in exchange for the shares of series b convertible preferred stock to be redeemed at a sum equal to the applicable original issue price per share plus five percent of the original issue price per year from the 
table of contents original issue date until the applicable redemption date  plus declared and unpaid dividends 
notice of redemption can be given at any time on or after the fifth anniversary of the original issue date 
in connection with these redemption rights  we recorded accretion of the redemption premium for the series b convertible preferred stock  excluding the shares owned by us  in the amount of million  million and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the accretion was recorded as subsidiary preferred stock accretion on the consolidated statement of operations through february  and as a reduction of additional paid in capital and an increase to minority interest on the consolidated balance sheets 
any obligation to make redemption payments is solely an obligation of codexis and any payments are to be made solely from assets of codexis 
since we no longer consolidate the financial position of codexis  as of february   we no longer recognized accretion for the codexis redemption premium 
we also no longer reflect amounts as minority interest on the consolidated balance sheets 
we have recorded a million adjustment to additional paid in capital to eliminate the reduction of additional paid in capital that had resulted from codexis preferred stock accretion prior to february  provision for income taxes no income tax expense was recorded from continuing operations for the years ended december   and for and  there was no provision for us federal  us state  or foreign income taxes for any period as we incurred operating losses for all jurisdictions 
for  we reported an income tax provision of  attributable to alternative minimum taxes as a result of the sale of verdia 
this amount has been netted against the gain on sale of verdia and is reflected in gain on sale of discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of operations 
in  we reported income due to the sale of verdia and utilized prior net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes 
deferred tax assets and the associated valuation allowance increased by million in due primarily to increases in net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and the associated valuation allowance decreased by million during due to the use of net operating loss carryforwards to offset the income due to the sale of verdia 
the valuation allowance decreased by million during due to the removal of codexis deferred tax assets due to the deconsolidation of codexis  offset by increases in net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million  which expire in the years through  and federal research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million  which expire in the years through utilization of our net operating losses and credits may be subject to substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code of  as amended  and similar state provisions 
such an annual limitation could result in the expiration of the net operating losses and credits before utilization

new accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb issued fasb staff position nos 
fas and fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  or fsp  which provides guidance on determining when investments in certain debt and equity securities are considered impaired  whether that impairment is other than temporary  and on measuring such impairment loss 
fsp also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other than temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other than temporary impairments 
fsp is required to be applied to reporting periods beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of fsp will have on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition but do not expect it to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
in may  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  or sfas  a replacement of accounting principles board opinions no 
 accounting changes  and 
table of contents statement no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
sfas changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
previously  most voluntary changes in accounting principles were recognized by including in net income during the period of change the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle 
sfas requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
sfas is effective for accounting changes made in fiscal years beginning after december   however  sfas does not change the transition provisions of any existing accounting pronouncements 
we do not believe adoption of sfas will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
on december   the fasb issued sfas r  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  or sfas sfas r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  or opinion  and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
sfas r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the effective date 
a modified retrospective method that includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate  based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas  for purposes of pro forma disclosures for all prior periods presented 
we adopted sfas r as of january  and expect to utilize the modified prospective method and the black scholes option pricing model 
as permitted by sfas  in we accounted for share based payments to employees using opinion s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognized no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  our implementation of sfas r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our result of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall cash position 
the impact of our implementation of sfas r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on  among other things  the levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted sfas r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income loss and earnings loss per share in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements under the heading stock based compensation 
sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement may reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend upon  among other things  the levels of share based payments granted in the future 
in march  the securities and exchange commission  or sec  released staff accounting bulletin no 
 or sab sab provides the position of the sec staff regarding the application of statement r 
sab contains interpretive guidance relating to the interaction between sfas r and certain sec rules and regulations  as well as the sec staff s views regarding the valuation of share based payment arrangements for public companies 
sab also highlights the importance of disclosures made related to the accounting for share based payment transactions

the following are contractual commitments at december  associated with debt  lease obligations and purchase obligations in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total since inception  we have received million from our collaborators and from government grants  which includes million of funding received by verdia  our former agriculture subsidiary and sole component of our agriculture segment  prior to its disposition  and million of deferred revenue from continuing operations to be recognized over the next six years 
approximately million has been received from our collaborators and million has been received from government funding 
assuming our research efforts for existing collaborations and grants continue for their full research terms  as of december   we had total committed funding of approximately million remaining to be received over the next four years 
potential milestone payments from our existing collaborations could exceed million based on the accomplishment of specific performance criteria  million of which relates to potential milestone payments in connection with currently active development programs 
we may also earn royalties on product sales 
in general  the obligation of our corporate collaborators to provide research funding may be terminated by either party before the end of the research term under certain conditions  including upon a material breach of the contract 
in the case of such an event  the agreement specifies the rights  if any  that each party will retain 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments  together with funding received from collaborators and government grants  will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
however  it is possible that we will seek additional financing within this timeframe 
we may raise additional funds through public or private financing  collaborative relationships or other arrangements 
additional funding  if sought  may not be available on terms favorable to us 
further  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
our failure to raise capital when needed may harm our business and operating results

the results of discontinued operations reflect the results of verdia until it was sold on july  our loss from discontinued operations was million in and million in item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange 
to mitigate some foreign currency exchange rate risk  we from time to time enter currency forward contracts 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 

table of contents interest rate risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents  short term and long term investments in a variety of securities  including corporate obligations and money market funds 
all investments and substantially all cash and cash equivalents are held in us currency  with approximately of cash and cash equivalents held in danish kroner and euros at december  as of december   approximately of our total portfolio was to mature in one year or less  with the remainder maturing in less than two years 
the following table represents the fair value balance of our cash  cash equivalents  short term and long term investments that are subject to interest rate risk by average interest rates as of december  dollars in thousands expected maturity cash and cash equivalents average interest rates short term investments average interest rates long term investments average interest rates we did not hold derivative instruments intended to mitigate interest rate risk as of december   and we have never held such instruments in the past 
if market interest rates were to increase by basis points  or  from december  levels  the fair value of our portfolio would decline by approximately million 
the modeling technique used measures the change in fair values arising from an immediate hypothetical shift in market interest rates and assumes ending fair values include principal plus accrued interest 
foreign currency exchange risk a portion of our operations consist of research and development activities performed in denmark by our wholly owned subsidiary  maxygen aps 
the functional currency of maxygen aps is the danish kroner 
in  approximately of our operating expenses related to maxygen aps 
as a result  our financial results may be affected by changes in the foreign currency exchange rates of the danish kroner and the euro 
a decrease in the value of the us dollar against the danish kroner or the euro will result in an increase of our reported operating expenses 
to protect against reductions in value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates  we from time to time enter into cash flow hedging arrangements 
currency forward contracts are utilized in these hedging arrangements 
our hedging arrangements reduce  but do not always eliminate  the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements 
gains and losses on these foreign currency investments are generally offset by corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instruments  resulting in negligible net exposure to us on the amounts hedged 
at december   we had foreign currency contracts outstanding in the form of forward exchange contracts totaling million which will be settled over the next six months with an average exchange rate of danish kroner to the us dollar and contracts totaling million which will be settled over the next six months with an average exchange rate of us dollars to the euro 
as of december   a decrease in the value of the us dollar relative to the danish kroner and the euro would result in an additional  gain on these contracts 
during  we recognized  in foreign exchange losses from hedge contracts  these losses were included with operating expenses 
during  we had foreign currency contracts outstanding in the form of forward exchange contracts totaling million 
we did not have any foreign exchange contracts outstanding at december
