this represents an increase of  over the prior year net income of  or per diluted share 
net income in fiscal includes an income tax benefit of  attributable primarily to the reversal of a previously recorded valuation allowance against deferred tax assets 
during fiscal  we repaid a total of  of the term loan portion of our credit facility 
on april   we amended our credit facility to permit us to pay cash dividends  subject to certain limitations 
this amendment to the facility also resulted in a decrease in the borrowing rate under our term loan  a decrease in the borrowing rate on revolving loans and a decrease in our letter of credit fee rate 
during fiscal  we declared cash dividends of per share of our common stock each quarter for a total of per share 
we are a nationwide owner  operator and franchisor of qsrs  operating principally under the carl s jr 
and hardee s brand names 
based on united states system wide sales  our hardee s and carl s jr 
chains are the tenth and twelfth largest quick service hamburger restaurant chains in the united states of america  respectively  according to the june  issue of nation s restaurant news 
as of january   the carl s jr 
system included  restaurants  of which we operated restaurants and our franchisees and licensees operated restaurants 
carl s jr 
restaurants are located in the western united states  predominantly in california 
as of january   the hardee s system consisted of  restaurants  of which we operated restaurants and our franchisees and licensees operated  restaurants 
hardee s restaurants are located primarily throughout the southeastern and midwestern united states 
we derive our revenue primarily from sales at company operated restaurants and revenue from franchisees  including franchise and royalty fees  sales to carl s jr 
franchisees and licensees of food and packaging products  rentals under real property leases and revenue from the sale of equipment to our franchisees 
restaurant operating expenses consist primarily of food and packaging costs  payroll and other 
table of contents cke restaurants  inc 
and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis continued dollars in thousands employee benefits and occupancy and other operating expenses of company operated restaurants 
franchise operating costs include the cost of food and packaging products sold to carl s jr 
franchisees and licensees  lease payments or depreciation expense on properties leased or subleased to our franchisees  the cost of equipment sold to franchisees  and franchise administrative support 
our revenue and expenses are directly affected by the number and sales volume of company operated restaurants and  to a lesser extent  franchised and licensed restaurants 
from time to time  we experience increases in our general operating costs 
in the past  we have been successful at passing on such increases through price increases  but it has likely had an impact on transaction counts 
if we were unable to pass along such price increases  and at the same time could not increase our transaction counts  the recoverability of the carrying value of our restaurants could be impacted 
critical accounting policies our reported results are impacted by the application of certain accounting policies that require us to make subjective or complex judgments 
these judgments involve making estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may significantly impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
specific risks associated with these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs 
for all of these policies  we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as expected  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
our most significant accounting policies require estimation of future cash flows used to assess the recoverability of long lived assets  including goodwill  and to establish the estimated liability for closing restaurants and subsidizing lease payments of franchisees  estimation  using actuarially determined methods  of our self insured claim losses under our workers compensation  general and auto liability insurance programs  determination of appropriate estimated liabilities for loss contingencies  determination of appropriate assumptions to use in evaluating leases for capital versus operating lease treatment  establishing depreciable lives for leasehold improvements and establishing straight line rent expense periods  estimation of the appropriate allowances associated with franchise and license receivables and liabilities for franchise subleases  determination of the appropriate assumptions to use to estimate the fair value of stock based compensation for purposes of disclosures of pro forma net income  and estimation of our net deferred income tax asset valuation allowance 
descriptions of these critical accounting policies follow 
impairment of property and equipment and other amortizable long lived assets held and used  held for sale or to be disposed of other than by sale we evaluate the carrying value of individual restaurants when the results of operations have reasonably progressed to a point to adequately evaluate the probability of continuing operating losses or upon expectation that a restaurant will be sold or otherwise disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
we generally estimate the useful life of restaurants on owned property to be to years and estimate the remaining useful life of restaurants subject to leases to range from the end of the lease term then in effect to 
table of contents cke restaurants  inc 
and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis continued dollars in thousands the end of such lease term including all option periods 
we then estimate the future cash flows from operating the restaurant over its estimated useful life 
in making these judgments  we consider the period of time since the restaurant was opened or remodeled  operating trends and expectations for future sales growth 
we also make assumptions about future same store sales and operating expenses 
our approach incorporates a probability weighted approach wherein we estimate the effectiveness of future sales and marketing efforts on same store sales 
if an estimate of the fair value of our assets becomes necessary  we typically base such estimate on forecasted cash flows discounted at the applicable restaurant concept s weighted average cost of capital 
during the second and fourth quarter of each fiscal year  and whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets may be impaired  we perform an asset recoverability analysis through which we estimate future cash flows for each of our restaurants based upon experience gained  current intentions about refranchising restaurants and closures  expected sales trends  internal plans and other relevant information 
as the operations of restaurants opened or remodeled in recent years progress to the point that their profitability and future prospects can adequately be evaluated  additional restaurants will become subject to review and to the possibility that impairments exist 
same store sales are a key assumption used to estimate future cash flow for evaluating recoverability 
for each of our restaurant concepts  to evaluate recoverability of restaurant assets we estimate same store sales will increase at an annual average rate of approximately over the remaining useful life of the restaurant 
we are also required to make assumptions regarding the rate at which restaurant operating costs will increase in the future 
if our same store sales do not perform at or above our forecasted level  or if restaurant operating cost increases exceed our forecast and we are unable to recover such costs through price increases  the carrying value of certain of our restaurants may prove to be unrecoverable and we may incur additional impairment charges in the future 
typically  restaurants are operated for three years before we test them for impairment 
also  restaurants typically are not tested for two years following a remodel 
we believe this provides the restaurant sufficient time to establish its presence in the market and build a customer base 
if we were to test all restaurants for impairment without regard to the amount of time the restaurants were operating  the total asset impairment could increase substantially 
in addition  if recently opened or remodeled restaurants do not eventually establish stronger market presence and build a customer base  the carrying value of certain of these restaurants may prove to be unrecoverable and we may incur additional impairment charges in the future 
as of january   we had a total of restaurants among our three major restaurant concepts that generated negative cash flows on a trailing one year basis 
these restaurants had combined net book values of  included within these totals are restaurants with combined net book values of  that have not been tested for impairment because they had not yet been operated for a sufficient period of time as of our most recent comprehensive semi annual asset quality review in the fourth quarter of fiscal if these negative cash flow restaurants were not to begin generating positive cash flows or expectations of positive cash flows within a reasonable period of time  the carrying value of these restaurants may prove to be unrecoverable and we may recognize additional impairment charges in the future 
impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit level  goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually during the first quarter of our fiscal year  and on an interim basis if events or circumstance indicate that it is more likely than not impairment may have occurred 
we consider the reporting unit level to be the brand level since the components eg  restaurants within each brand have similar economic characteristics  including products and services  production processes  types or classes of customers and distribution methods 
the impairment  if any  is measured based on the estimated fair value of the brand 
fair value can be determined based on 
table of contents cke restaurants  inc 
and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis continued dollars in thousands discounted cash flows  comparable sales or valuations of other restaurant brands 
impairment occurs when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value 
the most significant assumptions we use in this analysis are those made in estimating future cash flows 
in estimating future cash flows  we use the assumptions in our strategic plan for items such as same store sales  store count growth rates  and the discount rate we consider to be the market discount rate for acquisitions of restaurant companies and brands 
if the assumptions used in performing our impairment testing prove inaccurate  the fair value of the brands may ultimately prove to be significantly lower  thereby causing the carrying value to exceed the fair value and indicating that an impairment has occurred 
during the first quarter of fiscal year  we evaluated the carl s jr 
brand  the only one of our brands for which goodwill is recorded 
as a result of our evaluation  we concluded that the fair value of the net assets of carl s jr 
exceeded the carrying value  and thus no impairment charge was required 
as of january   we had  in goodwill recorded on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet  all of which relates to carl s jr 
estimated liability for closing restaurants we typically make decisions to close restaurants based on prospects for estimated future profitability 
however  sometimes we are forced to close restaurants due to circumstances beyond our control eg  a landlord s refusal to negotiate a new lease 
our restaurant operators evaluate each restaurant s performance no less frequently than the second and fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
when restaurants continue to perform poorly  we consider a number of factors  including the demographics of the location and the likelihood of being able to improve an unprofitable restaurant 
based on the operators judgment and a financial review  we estimate the future cash flows 
if we determine that the restaurant will not  within a reasonable period of time  operate at break even cash flow or be profitable  and we are not contractually obligated to continue operating the restaurant  we may close the restaurant 
the estimated liability for closing restaurants on properties vacated is based on the terms of the lease and the lease termination fee  if any  that we expect to pay  as well as estimated maintenance costs until the lease has been abated 
the amount of the estimated liability recorded is equal to the present value of these estimated future payments  which approximates the fair value of such obligations 
the interest rate used to calculate the present value of these liabilities is based on our incremental borrowing rate at the time the liability is established 
the related discount is amortized and shown in facility action charges  net in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
a significant assumption used in determining the amount of the estimated liability for closing restaurants is the amount of the estimated liability for future lease payments on vacant restaurants 
we estimate the cost to maintain leased and owned vacant properties until the lease has been abated or the owned property has been sold 
if the costs to maintain properties increase  or it takes longer than anticipated to sell properties  enter into subleases or terminate leases  we may need to record additional estimated liabilities 
if the leases on the vacant restaurants are not terminated or subleased on the terms that we used to estimate the liabilities  we may be required to record losses in future periods 
conversely  if the leases on the vacant restaurants are terminated or subleased on more favorable terms than we used to estimate the liabilities  we reverse the previously established estimated liabilities  resulting in an increase in operating income 
as of january   the present value of our operating lease payment obligations on all closed restaurants was approximately  which represents the discounted amount we would be required to pay if we are unable to enter into sublease agreements or terminate such leases prior to the end of the lease terms 
however  it is our experience that we can often terminate those leases for less than that amount  or sublease the property 
accordingly  we have recorded an estimated liability for operating lease obligations of  as of january  
table of contents cke restaurants  inc 
and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis continued dollars in thousands estimated liability for self insurance we are self insured for a portion of our current and prior years losses related to workers compensation  general and auto liability insurance programs 
we have obtained stop loss insurance for individual workers compensation  general and auto liability claims over accrued liabilities for self insurance are recorded based on the present value of actuarial estimates of the amounts of incurred and unpaid losses  based on an estimated risk free interest rate of as of january  in determining our estimated liability  management and our actuary develop assumptions based on the average historical losses on claims we have incurred and on actuarial observations of historical claim loss development 
our actual future loss development may be better or worse than the development we estimated in conjunction with the actuary  in which case our reserves would require adjustment 
as such  if we experience a higher than expected number of claims or the costs of claims rise more than expected  then we would be required to adjust the expected losses upward and increase our future self insurance expense 
our actuary provides a range of estimated unpaid losses for each loss category  upon which our analysis is based 
as of january   our estimated liability for self insured workers compensation  general and automobile liability losses ranged from a low of  to a high of  after adjusting to the actuarially determined best estimate  our recorded reserves for self insurance liabilities were  as of january  loss contingencies we maintain accrued liabilities for contingencies related to litigation 
we account for contingent obligations in accordance with sfas  accounting for contingencies  which requires that we assess each loss contingency to determine estimates of the degree of probability and range of possible settlement 
those contingencies that are deemed to be probable and where the amount of such settlement is reasonably estimable are accrued in our consolidated financial statements 
if only a range of loss can be determined  with no amount in the range representing a better estimate than any other amount within the range  we accrue to the low end of the range 
in accordance with sfas  as of january   we have recorded an accrued liability for contingencies related to litigation in the amount of  see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
the assessment of contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events 
contingencies are reviewed at least quarterly to determine the adequacy of the recorded liabilities and related consolidated financial statement disclosure 
the ultimate resolution of such loss contingencies may differ materially from amounts we have accrued in our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  as of january   we estimated our potential exposure for those loss contingencies related to other litigation claims that we believe are reasonably possible to result in an adverse outcome  to be in the range of to in accordance with sfas  we have not recorded a liability for these contingent losses 
accounting for lease obligations we lease a substantial portion of our restaurant properties 
at the inception of the lease  each property is evaluated to determine whether the lease will be accounted for as an operating or capital lease 
the lease accounting evaluation may require significant exercise of judgment in estimating the fair value and useful life of the leased property and to establish the appropriate lease term 
the lease term used for this evaluation includes renewal option periods only in instances in which the exercise of the renewal option can be reasonably assured because failure to exercise such option would result in an economic penalty 
such economic penalty would typically result from our having to abandon buildings and other non detachable improvements upon vacating the property 
the lease term used for this evaluation also provides the basis for establishing 
table of contents cke restaurants  inc 
and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis continued dollars in thousands depreciable lives for buildings subject to lease and leasehold improvements  as well as the period over which we recognize straight line rent expense 
in addition  the lease term is calculated from the date we take possession of the leased premises through the lease termination date 
there is potential for variability in the rent holiday period  which begins on the possession date and typically ends upon restaurant opening 
factors that may affect the length of the rent holiday period generally include construction related delays 
extension of the rent holiday period due to such delays would result in greater rent expense recognized during the rent holiday period 
franchised and licensed operations we monitor the financial condition of certain franchisees and record provisions for estimated losses on receivables when we believe that our franchisees are unable to make their required payments to us 
each quarter  we perform an analysis to develop estimated bad debts for each franchisee 
we then compare the aggregate result of that analysis to the amount recorded in our consolidated financial statements as the allowance for doubtful accounts and adjust the allowance as appropriate 
additionally  we cease accruing royalties and rental income from franchisees that are materially delinquent in paying or in default for other reasons and reverse any uncollected royalties and rent income accrued during the fiscal quarter in which such delinquency or default occurs 
over time  our assessment of individual franchisees may change 
for instance  we have had some franchisees  who in the past we had determined required an estimated loss equal to the total amount of the receivable  who have paid us in full or established a consistent record of payments generally one year such that we determined an allowance was no longer required 
depending on the facts and circumstances  there are a number of different actions we and or our franchisees may take to resolve franchise collections issues 
these actions may include the purchase of franchise restaurants by us or by other franchisees  a modification to the franchise agreement  which may include a provision to defer certain royalty payments or reduce royalty rates in the future  a restructuring of the franchisee s business and or finances including the restructuring of leases for which we are the primary obligee see further discussion below or  if necessary  the termination of the franchise agreement 
the allowance established is based on our assessment of the most probable course of action that will occur 
many of the restaurants that we sold to hardee s and carl s jr 
franchisees as part of our refranchising program were on leased sites 
generally  we remain principally liable for the lease and have entered into a sublease with the franchisee on the same terms as the primary lease 
in such cases  we account for the sublease payments received as franchising rental income and the lease payments we make as rental expense in franchised and licensed restaurants and other expense in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
as of january   the present value of our total obligation on lease arrangements with hardee s and carl s jr 
franchisees  including subsidized leases discussed further below  was  and  respectively 
we do not expect carl s jr 
franchisees to experience the same level of financial difficulties as hardee s franchisees have encountered in the past  however  we can provide no assurance that this will not occur 
in addition to the sublease arrangements with franchisees described above  we also lease land and buildings to franchisees 
as of january   the net book value of property under lease to hardee s and carl s jr 
franchisees was  and  respectively 
financially troubled franchisees are those with whom we have entered into workout agreements and who may have liquidity problems in the future 
in the event that a financially troubled franchisee closes a restaurant for which we own the property  our options are to operate the restaurant as a company operated restaurant  lease the property to another tenant or sell the property 
these circumstances would cause us to consider whether the carrying value of the land and building was impaired 
if we determined the property value was impaired  we would record a charge to operations for the amount the carrying value of the property exceeds its fair value 
as of january   the net book value 
table of contents cke restaurants  inc 
and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis continued dollars in thousands of property under lease to hardee s franchisees that are considered to be financially troubled franchisees was approximately  and is included in the amount above 
during fiscal or thereafter  some of these franchisees may close restaurants and  accordingly  we may record an impairment loss in connection with some of these closures 
in accordance with sfas  an estimated liability for future lease obligations on restaurants operated by franchisees for which we are the primary obligee is established on the date the franchisee closes the restaurant 
also  we record an estimated liability for subsidized lease payments when we sign a sublease agreement committing us to the subsidy 
the liability includes an estimation related to the risk that certain lease payments from the franchisee may ultimately be uncollectible 
the amount of the estimated liability is established using the methodology described in estimated liability for closing restaurants above 
because losses are typically not probable and or able to be reasonably estimated  we have not established an additional estimated liability for potential losses not yet incurred under a significant portion of our franchise sublease arrangements 
the present value of future sublease obligations from financially troubled franchisees is approximately  six financially troubled franchisees represent approximately of this amount 
if sales trends economic conditions worsen for our franchisees  their financial health may worsen  our collection rates may decline and we may be required to assume the responsibility for additional lease payments on franchised restaurants 
entering into restructured franchise agreements may result in reduced franchise royalty rates in the future see discussion above 
the likelihood of needing to increase the estimated liability for future lease obligations is primarily related to the success of our hardee s concept 
during february  we terminated our franchise agreement with a financially troubled hardee s franchisee that operates approximately franchised restaurants as a result of its inability to remedy  on a timely basis  certain defaults under the terms of the agreement 
the franchisee is continuing to operate the affected restaurants pursuant to a temporary license agreement  which we can terminate without cause or notice 
ten of the affected restaurants are located on property that we own and lease to the franchisee 
as of january   the aggregate net book value of land and building at these locations is  in addition  restaurants are located on leased premises that we sublease to the franchisee 
as of january   the present value of our obligation to the lessors under the master leases for these locations is  we have no investment in land or buildings at these locations 
during march  we terminated the leases and subleases pertaining to the aforementioned restaurants 
we intend to either operate most of these locations as company operated restaurants or refranchise the restaurants 
however  we may close a number of these restaurants  in which case we would record a charge for future lease obligations at the affected locations 
the franchisee and its lenders are considering alternatives for the remaining restaurants  including the possibility that we may operate some or all of these restaurants 
as of january   our accounts and notes receivable from this franchisee were fully reserved 
in addition  we have not recognized  on a cumulative basis   in accounts receivable and  in notes receivable  nor the royalty and rent revenue associated with these accounts and notes receivable 
during fiscal  we recognized royalty and rent revenue related to this franchisee of  and  respectively 
stock based compensation as discussed in notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements  we have various stock based compensation plans that provide options for certain employees and non employee directors to purchase shares of our common stock 
we have elected to account for stock based compensation in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion  accounting for stock issued to 
table of contents cke restaurants  inc 
and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis continued dollars in thousands employees  which utilizes the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock based compensation  as opposed to using the fair value method prescribed in sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
because of this election  we are required to make certain disclosures of pro forma net income assuming we had adopted sfas we determine the estimated fair value of stock based compensation on the date of the grant using the fair value based method of the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the historical stock price volatility  expected life of the option and the risk free interest rate 
a change in one or more of the assumptions used in the black scholes option pricing model may result in a material change to the estimated fair value of the stock based compensation see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for analysis of the effect of certain changes in assumptions used to determine the fair value of stock based compensation 
as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  we will be required to adopt sfas revised  share based payment  as of the beginning of fiscal valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets deferred income taxes are provided for the estimated income tax effect of temporary differences between the financial and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the liability method 
deferred tax assets are also provided for net operating loss and income tax credit carryforwards 
a valuation allowance to reduce the carrying amount of deferred tax assets is established when it is more likely than not that we will not realize some portion or all of the tax benefit of our deferred tax assets 
we evaluate  on a quarterly basis  whether it is probable that our deferred income tax assets are realizable 
in performing this analysis  we consider all available evidence  both positive and negative  including historical operating results  the estimated timing of future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences  estimated future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards  and potential tax planning strategies that may be employed to prevent operating loss or tax credit carryforwards from expiring unused 
as of january   we maintained a valuation allowance of  against our net deferred tax assets  since we had determined  based primarily on a history of cumulative losses in recent years and uncertainty regarding the timing and amounts of future taxable income  that realization of our deferred tax assets was not more likely that not 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  after considering a number of factors  including a three year history of cumulative earnings  utilization of net operating loss carryforwards in fiscal  and estimated taxable income in future years  we determined we would more likely than not realize substantial future tax benefits from our deferred tax assets 
as a result of this analysis  we reduced our valuation allowance by  at january   resulting in a net deferred tax asset of  of the total tax benefit from the reversal of the valuation allowance   was recorded to additional paid in capital for the tax benefit from the exercise of stock options during both the current and prior years 
as of january   our remaining valuation allowance of  relates to federal and state capital loss carryforwards  foreign tax credits  and certain state net operating loss and income tax credit carryforwards 
realization of the tax benefit of such deferred tax assets may remain uncertain for the foreseeable future  even though we expect to generate taxable income  since they are subject to various limitations and may only be used to offset income of certain entities or of a certain character 
during fiscal  we expect to begin recording a provision for federal and state income tax expense using an effective rate of approximately 
as a result of our net operating loss nol and income tax credit carryforwards and expected reversals of temporary differences  we expect that our cash requirements for us federal  foreign and state income taxes will approximate of our taxable earnings in fiscal and until such time as our various nols and tax credits are utilized 
this rate results primarily from alternative minimum tax amt  under which of taxable earnings cannot be offset by nol carryforwards and is subject to tax at the amt rate of 
the actual cash requirements for income taxes 
table of contents cke restaurants  inc 
and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis continued dollars in thousands could vary significantly from our expectations for a number of reasons  including  but not limited to  unanticipated fluctuations in our deferred tax assets and liabilities  unexpected gains from significant transactions  unexpected outcomes of income tax audits  and changes in tax law 
we expect to continue to incur foreign taxes on our income earned outside the us  which we expect to result in a credit against our us federal tax liability 
restaurant portfolio strategy in fiscal  we embarked on a refranchising initiative to generate cash to reduce outstanding borrowings on our senior credit facility  as well as to increase the number of franchise operated restaurants 
additionally  as sales trends for the hardee s restaurants and certain carl s jr 
restaurants primarily in the oklahoma area continued to decline in fiscal and fiscal  we determined that it was necessary to close certain restaurants for which a return to profitability was not likely 
these activities resulted in the charges reflected in our accompanying consolidated financial statements as facility action charges  net 
during fiscal  and  we recorded facility action charges of   and  respectively  which were primarily non cash in nature 
business strategy we remain focused on vigorously pursuing our comprehensive business strategy 
the main components of our strategy are as follows remain focused on restaurant fundamentals quality  service and cleanliness  offer premium products that compete on quality and taste  build on the strength of the carl s jr 
brand  including dual branding opportunities with green burrito  continue to execute and refine the hardee s turnaround program  including testing of dual branding opportunities with red burrito  control costs while increasing revenues  leverage our infrastructure and marketing presence to build out existing core markets  and strengthen our franchise system and pursue further franchising opportunities 
franchise operations like others in the qsr industry  some of our franchisees experience financial difficulties from time to time with respect to their operations 
our approach to dealing with financial and operational issues that arise from these situations is described under critical accounting policies above  under the heading franchised and licensed operations 
some franchisees in the hardee s system have experienced significant financial problems and  as discussed above  there are a number of potential resolutions of these financial issues 
we continue to work with franchisees in an attempt to maximize our future franchising income 
our franchising income is dependent on both the number of restaurants operated by franchisees and their operational and financial success  such that they can make their royalty and lease payments to us 
although we review the allowance for doubtful accounts and the estimated liability for closed franchise restaurants quarterly see discussion under critical accounting policies franchised and licensed operations  there can be no assurance that the number of franchisees or franchised restaurants experiencing financial difficulties will not increase from our current assessments  nor can there be any assurance that we will be successful in resolving financial issues relating to any specific franchisee 
as of january   our consolidated allowance for doubtful accounts on notes receivable was of the gross balance of notes receivable and our 
table of contents cke restaurants  inc 
and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis continued dollars in thousands consolidated allowance for doubtful accounts on accounts receivable was of the gross balance of accounts receivable 
during fiscal and to a lesser extent during fiscal and  we established several notes receivable pursuant to completing workout agreements with several troubled franchisees 
as of january   we have not recognized  on a cumulative basis   in accounts receivable and  in notes receivable  nor the royalty and rent revenue associated with these accounts and notes receivable  due from franchisees that are in default under the terms of their franchise agreements 
we still experience specific problems with troubled franchisees see critical accounting policies franchise and licensed operations and may be required to increase the amount of our allowances for doubtful accounts and or increase the amount of our estimated liability for future lease obligations

and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis continued dollars in thousands accounting pronouncements not yet adopted in december  the fasb issued sfas revised  share based payment sfas r  which replaces sfas  supersedes apb and related interpretations and amends sfas  statement of cash flows 
the provisions of sfas r are similar to those of sfas  however  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements as compensation cost based on their fair value on the date of grant 
fair value of share based awards will be determined using option pricing models eg  black scholes or binomial models and assumptions that appropriately reflect the specific circumstances of the awards 
compensation cost for existing awards will be recognized over the vesting period based on the fair value of awards that actually vest 
we will be required to choose between the modified prospective and modified retrospective transition alternatives in adopting sfas r 
under the modified prospective transition method  compensation cost would be recognized in financial statements issued subsequent to the date of adoption for all shared based payments granted  modified or settled after the date of adoption  as well as for any unvested awards that were granted prior to the date of adoption 
as we previously adopted only the pro forma disclosure provisions of sfas  under this method we would recognize compensation cost relating to the unvested portion of awards granted prior to the date of adoption using the same estimate of the grant date fair value and the same attribution method used to determine the pro forma disclosures under sfas under the modified retrospective transition method  compensation cost would be recognized in a manner consistent with the modified prospective transition method  however  prior period financial statements would also be restated by recognizing compensation cost as previously reported in the pro forma disclosures under sfas the restatement provisions can be applied to either i all periods presented or ii to the beginning of the fiscal year in which sfas r is adopted 
sfas r is effective at the beginning of the first annual period beginning after june  fiscal for us 
we will evaluate the use of certain option pricing models as well as the assumptions to be used in such models 
when such evaluation is complete  we will determine the transition method to use 
we do not currently anticipate that the impact on net income on a full year basis of the adoption of sfas r will be significantly different from the historical pro forma impacts as disclosed in accordance with sfas in november  the fasb issued sfas  inventory costs 
sfas clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facilities expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material

previously  accounting principles generally accepted in the us gaap required that the cumulative effect of most changes in accounting principle be recognized in the period of the change

historically  consistent with the industry  we have been able to pass along to our customers  through price increases  higher costs arising from these inflationary factors 
seasonality our business is affected by seasonality 
average restaurant sales are normally higher in the summer months than during the winter months for each of our restaurant concepts 
in comparison with our carl s jr

competition as discussed above in business in item of this annual report on form k  the foodservice industry is intensively competitive 
we compete with a diverse group of food service companies major restaurant chains  casual dining restaurants  nutrition oriented restaurants and prepared food stores  making it difficult to attribute specific results of operations to the actions of any of our competitors 
liquidity and capital resources we currently finance our business through cash flow from operations and borrowings under our credit facility 
we believe our most significant use of cash during the next months will be for capital expenditures 
we amended and restated the facility on june   and amended the facility again on november  and april  see below 
we anticipate that existing cash balances  borrowing capacity under the facility  and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to service existing debt and to meet our operating and capital requirements for at least the next months 
we have no potential mandatory payments of principal on our  of convertible subordinated notes due until october  we  and the restaurant industry in general  maintain relatively low levels of accounts receivable and inventories  and vendors grant trade credit for purchases such as food and supplies 
we also continually invest in our business through the addition of new sites and the refurbishment of existing sites  which are reflected as long term assets and not as part of working capital 
as a result  we typically maintain current liabilities in excess of current assets  resulting in a working capital deficit

the facility is collateralized by a lien on all of our personal property assets and liens on certain restaurant properties 
as of january   the applicable interest rate on the term loan was libor plus  or per annum 
for the revolving loan portion of the facility  the applicable rate was prime plus  or per annum 
we also incur fees on outstanding letters of credit under the facility at a rate equal to the applicable margin for libor revolving loans  which is currently per annum 
the facility required us to enter into interest rate protection agreements in an aggregate notional amount of at least  for a term of at least three years 
pursuant to this requirement  on july   we entered into two interest rate cap agreements in an aggregate notional amount of  under the terms of each agreement  if libor exceeds on the measurement date for any quarterly period  we will receive payments equal to the amount libor exceeds  multiplied by i the notional amount of the agreement and ii the fraction of a year represented by the quarterly period 
the agreements expire on july  the agreements were not designated as cash flow hedges under the provisions of sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
accordingly  the change in the fair value of the of interest rate cap premiums is recognized quarterly in interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
during the year ended january   we recognized a charge of to interest expense to reduce the carrying value of the interest rate cap premiums to their fair value of at january  as a matter of policy  we do not use derivative instruments unless there is an underlying exposure 
the facility also permits us to repurchase our common stock or pay dividends in an amount up to approximately  as of january  in addition  the amount that we may spend to repurchase our common stock or pay dividends is increased each year by a portion of excess cash flow as defined in the agreement during the term of the facility 
in april  our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase plan to allow us to repurchase up to  of our common stock 
pursuant to this authorization  during fiscal  we repurchased  shares of our common stock at an average price of per share  for a total cost  including trading commissions  of  during the third quarter of fiscal  we repurchased  shares of our common stock at an average price of per share  for a total cost  including trading commissions  of in order to facilitate future repurchases of our common stock under the stock repurchase plan  our board of directors authorized  and we implemented  a share repurchase plan pursuant to rule b of the exchange act that allows us to repurchase  of our common stock in the open market each fiscal quarter during the period beginning november  and ending january   for a total of  rule b allows us to repurchase our common stock when we might otherwise be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws or because of self imposed trading blackout periods

based on these terms  and assuming adjusted ebitda in fiscal is equal to adjusted ebitda in fiscal  the facility would permit us to make capital expenditures of  in fiscal  which could increase or decrease based on our performance versus the adjusted ebitda formula described above 
until recently  our senior credit facility facility prohibited us from paying cash dividends 
on april   we amended the facility to permit us to pay cash dividends  subject to certain limitations comparable to limitations on our to repurchase shares of our common stock 
this amendment to the facility also resulted in a decrease in the borrowing rate under our term loan  a decrease in the borrowing rate on revolving loans and a decrease in our letter of credit fee rate 
on april   we announced that our board of directors had declared of a cash dividend of per share of our common stock  and we further announced our intention to pay a regular quarterly cash dividend 
during the fiscal year ended january   we declared aggregate cash dividends of per share of common stock  for a total of  as of january   dividends payable of  have been included in other current liabilities in our accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
these dividends were subsequently paid on february  the facility contains financial performance covenants  which include a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and maximum leverage ratios 
in addition  we are required under the facility to generate a minimum adjusted ebitda  as defined  of at least  on a trailing four quarter basis 
the calculation of our adjusted ebitda is included under the caption presentation of non gaap measurements  in item of this annual report on form k 
we were in compliance with these covenants and all other requirements of the facility as of january  the full text of the contractual requirements imposed by the facility is set forth in the sixth amended and restated credit agreement  dated as of june   and the amendments thereto  which we have filed with the securities and exchange commission  and in the ancillary loan documents described therein 
subject to cure periods in certain instances  the lenders under our facility may demand repayment of borrowings prior to stated maturity upon certain events  including if we breach the terms of the agreement  suffer a material adverse change  engage in a change of control transaction  suffer certain adverse legal judgments  in the event of specified events of insolvency or if we default on other significant obligations 
in the event the facility is declared accelerated by the lenders which can occur only if we are in default under the facility  our convertible notes described below may also become accelerated under certain circumstances and after all cure periods have expired

under the terms of the convertible notes  such notes became convertible into our common stock at a conversion price of approximately per share effective july   and will remain convertible throughout the remainder of their term 
as of january   the cumulative dividends we have declared on our common stock caused a change in the conversion rate per of the convertible notes of  from an original conversion rate of to an adjusted conversion rate of

the terms of the facility are not dependent on any change in our credit rating 
the convertible notes contain a convertibility trigger based on the credit ratings of the notes  however  such trigger is no longer applicable since the notes are now convertible through the remainder of their term  as discussed above 
we believe the key company specific factors affecting our ability to maintain our existing debt financing relationships and to access such capital in the future are our present and expected levels of profitability and cash flow from operations  asset collateral bases and the level of our equity capital relative to our debt obligations 
in addition  as noted above  our existing debt agreements include significant restrictions on future financings including  among others  limits on the amount of indebtedness we may incur or which may be secured by any of our assets 
during the fiscal year ended january   cash provided by operating activities was  an increase of  or  over the prior year 
although net income for fiscal was  higher than net income for fiscal   of the increase was attributable to the non cash reversal of a previously recorded valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in fiscal in addition  the prior year included significantly more non cash charges than fiscal  including losses on asset disposals  write off of deferred financing costs related to debt extinguishments  facility action charges  accruals for litigation  and higher depreciation and amortization 
the remaining fluctuation is attributable primarily to changes in operating assets and liabilities  including accounts receivable  accounts payable and other liability accounts 
working capital account balances can vary significantly from quarter to quarter  depending upon the timing of large customer receipts and payments to vendors  but they are not anticipated to be a significant source or use of cash over the long term

borrowings under the facility bear interest at the prime rate or libor plus an applicable margin 
a hypothetical increase of basis points in short term interest rates would result in a reduction in our annual pre tax earnings of  the estimated reduction is based upon the outstanding balance of the borrowings under the facility and the weighted average interest rate for the quarter and assumes no change in the volume  index or composition of debt as in effect on january  as of january   a hypothetical increase of basis points in short term interest rates would also cause the fair value of our convertible subordinated notes due to decrease approximately  the decrease in fair value was determined by discounting the projected cash flows assuming redemption on october  substantially all of our business is transacted in us dollars 
accordingly  foreign exchange rate fluctuations have not had a significant impact on us historically and are not expected to in the foreseeable future 
commodity price risk we purchase certain products which are affected by commodity prices and are  therefore  subject to price volatility caused by weather  market conditions and other factors which are not predictable or within our control 
although many of the products purchased are subject to changes in commodity prices  certain purchasing contracts or pricing arrangements contain risk management techniques designed to minimize price volatility 
the purchasing contracts and pricing arrangements we use may result in unconditional purchase obligations  which are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
typically  we use these types of purchasing techniques to control costs as an alternative to directly managing financial instruments to hedge commodity prices 
in many cases  we believe we will be able to address material commodity cost increases by adjusting our menu pricing or changing our product delivery strategy 
however  increases in commodity prices  without adjustments to our menu prices  could increase restaurant operating costs as a percentage of company operated revenue for our restaurant concepts
