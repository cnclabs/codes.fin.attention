item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview this annual report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
we use words such as anticipate  believe  plan  expect  future  intend and similar expressions to identify forward looking statements 
these statements appear throughout the annual report and are statements regarding our intent  belief or current expectations  primarily with respect to our operations and related industry developments 
you should not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which apply only as of the date of this annual report 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements for many reasons  including the risks faced by us and described in the section of item entitled additional factors that may affect future results  and elsewhere in this annual report 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in part i  item of this annual report 
we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing three groups of products i therapeutic products for oncology that target telomerase  ii pharmaceuticals that activate telomerase in tissues impacted by senescence  injury or degenerative disease  and iii cell based therapies derived from our human embryonic stem cell platform for applications in multiple chronic diseases as discussed in more detail in item business of this annual report on form k beginning on page critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
note of notes to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies  as defined below 
a critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of our financial statements and requires management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
specifically  critical accounting estimates have the following attributes i we are required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate  and ii different estimates we could reasonably have used  or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur  would have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates may change as new events occur  as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes 
these changes have historically been minor and have been included in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they became known 
based on a critical assessment of our accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies  management believes that our consolidated financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  and meaningfully present our financial condition and results of operations 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition since our inception  a substantial portion of our revenues has been generated from research and licensing agreements with collaborators 
revenue under such collaboration agreements typically includes upfront signing or license fees  cost reimbursements  milestone payments and royalties on future product sales 
we recognize nonrefundable signing or license fees that are not dependent on future performance under these agreements as revenue when received and over the term of the arrangement if we have continuing performance obligations 
we recognize option payments as revenue over the term of the option agreement 
we recognize milestone payments upon completion of specified milestones  which represents the culmination of an earnings process  according to contract terms 
royalties are recognized as revenue upon the receipt of payment of the royalty amount 
we recognize cost reimbursement revenue under collaborative agreements  including related party agreements  as the related research and development costs are performed 
deferred revenue represents the portion of research or license payments received which had not been earned 
we estimate the projected future life of license agreements over which we recognize revenue 
our estimates are based on historical experience and general industry practice 
revisions in the estimated lives of these license agreements have the effect of increasing or decreasing license fee revenue in the period of revision 
as of december   no revisions to the estimated future lives of license agreements have been made and we do not expect revisions to the currently active agreements in the future 
intangible asset and research funding obligation in may  we completed the acquisition of roslin bio med ltd  a privately held company formed by the roslin institute in midlothian  scotland 
in connection with this acquisition  we formed a research collaboration with the roslin institute and committed approximately  in research funding over six years 
using an effective interest rate of  this research funding obligation had a net present value of  at the acquisition date and this amount was capitalized as an intangible asset that was being amortized as research and development expense over the six year funding period 
in december  we extended the research funding period from june  to june   and we adjusted the amortization period of the intangible asset to coincide with the extended research period 
no additional funding was committed 
through april  imputed interest has been accreted to the value of the research funding obligation and recognized as interest expense 
at the time of acquisition  we estimated the effective interest rate and have been evaluating the spending rate under the collaboration as compared to the contractual funding period 
revisions in the effective interest rate or amortization period would have the effect of increasing or decreasing research and development expense as well as the balance of intangible assets and research funding obligation on the balance sheet 
as of december   no revisions to the effective interest rate have been made and we do not expect revisions in the future 
further adjustments to the amortization period may occur as we near the end of the extended research period and evaluate our continuing research support 
valuation of equity instruments as permitted by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  sfas  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosures sfas  we elected to continue to apply the provisions of apb opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees  apb opinion and related interpretations in accounting for our employee stock option and stock purchase plans 
we are generally not required under apb opinion and related interpretations to recognize compensation expense in connection with our employee stock option and stock purchase plans 
to comply with sfas  we presented in the notes to consolidated financial statements  the pro forma effect on our net loss and loss per share as if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of sfas  as amended  to options granted to employees under our stock based employee compensation plans 
we have adopted the requirements of sfas r effective january   utilizing the modified prospective method 
we have selected the black scholes option pricing model as the most appropriate fair value method for our awards and will recognize compensation cost on a straight line basis over our awards vesting periods 
we anticipate that the adoption of sfas r effective january   will result in stock based compensation expense in fiscal of approximately million for the vested portion of past awards 
we expect that additional compensation expense as a result of adopting sfas r will result in additional net loss per share of approximately to per share for these estimates are based solely on awards that were currently unvested at january   and does not reflect the potential impact of additional options that may be granted in in valuing our options using the black scholes option pricing model  we make assumptions about risk free interest rates  dividend yields  volatility and weighted average expected lives of the options 
risk free interest rates are derived from united states zero coupon treasury strip yields as of the option grant date 
dividend yields are based on our historical dividend payments  which have been zero to date 
volatility is derived from the historical volatility of our common stock as traded on nasdaq 
the weighted average expected lives of the options is based on historical experience of option exercises and the average vesting option schedule 
each year  we have consistently applied the same methodology when deriving these assumptions 
revisions of any of these assumptions would increase or decrease the value of the option and increase or decrease the pro forma effect on reported net income loss and earnings loss per share if compensation expense had been recognized based on the fair value method 
as of december   no revisions to the methods used in deriving the assumptions used in the black scholes option pricing model have been made 
revisions may occur in the future with the adoption of sfas r 
in valuing our warrants using the black scholes option pricing model  we make assumptions about risk free interest rates  dividend yields  volatility and expected lives of the warrants 
risk free interest rates are derived from united states zero coupon treasury strip yields as of the warrant issue date 
dividend yields are based on our historical dividend payments  which have been zero to date 
volatility is derived from the historical volatility of our common stock as traded on nasdaq 
the expected lives of the warrants is based on the term of the warrants 
upon issuance of a warrant to consultants or collaborators  we recognize an expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
upon issuance of warrants in connection with an equity financing  we recognize issuance costs with an offset to additional paid in capital in our consolidated balance sheets 
each year  we have consistently applied the same methodology when deriving these assumptions 
revisions of any of these assumptions would increase or decrease the value of the warrant and increase or decrease the expense or issuance cost recognized upon vesting of the warrant 
as of december   no revisions to the methods used in deriving the assumptions used in the black scholes option pricing model for warrants have been made 
revisions may occur in the future with the adoption of sfas r 
results of operations our results of operations have fluctuated from period to period and may continue to fluctuate in the future  based upon the progress of our research and development efforts and variations in the level of expenses related to developmental efforts during any given period 
results of operations for any period may be unrelated to results of operations for any other period 
in addition  historical results should not be viewed as indicative of future operating results 
we are subject to risks common to companies in our industry and at our stage of development  including risks inherent in our research and development efforts  reliance upon our collaborative partners  enforcement of our patent and proprietary rights  need for future capital  potential competition and uncertainty of preclinical and clinical trial results or regulatory approvals or clearances 
in order for a product candidate to be commercialized based on our research  we and our collaborators must conduct preclinical tests and clinical trials  demonstrate the efficacy and safety of our product candidates  obtain regulatory approvals or clearances and enter into manufacturing  distribution and marketing arrangements  as well as obtain market acceptance 
we do not expect to receive revenues or royalties based on therapeutic products for a period of years  if at all 
revenues we recognized  of revenues from collaborative agreements in compared to none in and  in revenues in reflected amounts earned under a contract to perform scientific research services to a related party  our joint venture in hong kong  ta therapeutics 
revenues in primarily reflected research services conducted for others in connection with consulting contracts 
we have entered into license and option agreements with companies involved with oncology  diagnostics  research tools  agriculture and biologics production 
in each of these agreements  we have granted certain rights to our technologies 
in connection with the agreements  we are entitled to receive license fees  option fees  milestone payments and royalties on future sales  or any combination thereof 
we recognized license and option fee revenues of million   and  in  and  respectively  related to our various agreements 
the overall increase in license fee revenue in was primarily due to i the million license fee payment received in connection with the transfer of nuclear transfer intellectual property rights for use in animal cloning to our new joint venture  start licensing  inc  and ii revenue recognized from the collaborative agreement with merck 
we expect to recognize revenue of million in  million in   in   in and  thereafter related to our existing deferred revenue 
current revenues may not be predictive of future revenues 
we received royalties of   and  in  and  respectively  on product sales of telomerase detection and telomere measurement kits to the research use only market  cell based research products and agricultural products 
license and royalty revenues are dependent upon additional agreements being signed and future product sales 
research and development expenses research and development expenses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in from was primarily the result of an increase in personnel related costs of million for additional scientific headcount  an increase in clinical consulting costs related to grnl of million  and an increase in scientific supplies expense of million  partially offset by a reduction in preclinical study expenses of million as a result of the commencement of clinical trials for grnl in the increase in from was primarily due to an increase of million for raw materials for the manufacture of grnl  million for scientific supplies  million for animal toxicology studies related to the clinical development of grnl and  for clinical consulting and sponsored research at other academic laboratories 
overall  we expect research and development expenses to increase in the next year as we incur expenses related to manufacturing and clinical testing of grnl  continue clinical trials of our telomerase cancer vaccine and continue development of our human embryonic stem cell hesc programs 
our research and development activities can be divided into two major categories of related programs  oncology and hesc therapies 
the oncology programs focus on treating or diagnosing cancer by targeting or detecting the presence of telomerase  either inhibiting activity of the telomerase enzyme  diagnosing cancer by detecting the presence of telomerase  or using telomerase as a target for therapeutic vaccines 
our core knowledge base in telomerase and telomere biology supports all these approaches  and our scientists may contribute to any or all of these programs in a given period 
for our telomerase inhibition program  we have initiated clinical testing of grnl in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia at two clinical trial sites in the new york metropolitan area 
an investigator sponsored phase clinical trial at duke university medical center using a therapeutic vaccine targeting telomerase in patients with metastatic prostate cancer has been completed 
study results showed no treatment related adverse effects to date and positive specific immune responses to telomerase 
we currently are conducting additional phase studies in patients with prostate cancer  hematologic malignancies and renal carcinoma at duke 
we have transferred the vaccine manufacturing process in house for further optimization and transfer to a contract manufacturer 
at the conclusion of these activities  we plan to file our ind with the fda for clinical trials in one or more cancer types 
our hesc therapy programs focus on treating injuries and degenerative diseases with cell therapies based on cells derived from hescs 
a core of knowledge of hesc biology  as well as a significant continuing effort in deriving  growing  maintaining  and differentiating hescs  underlies all aspects of this group of programs 
many of our researchers are allocated to more than one hesc project  and the percentage allocations of time change as the resource needs of individual programs vary 
in our hesc therapy programs  we have concentrated our resources on several specific cell types 
we have developed proprietary methods to culture and scale up undifferentiated hescs and differentiate them into therapeutically relevant cells 
we are now testing six different therapeutic cell types in animal models of human disease 
in four of these cell types  we have preliminary results suggesting efficacy as evidenced by functional improvements or engraftment of the cells in the treated animals 
after completion of these studies  and assuming continued success  we expect to begin phase clinical trials  most likely for the treatment of spinal cord injury 
research and development expenses incurred under each of these programs is as follows in thousands 
geron k revbxxjpg 
at this time  we cannot provide reliable estimates of how much time or investment will be necessary to commercialize products from the programs currently in progress 
drug development in the us is a process that includes multiple steps defined by the fda under applicable statutes  regulations and guidance documents 
after the preclinical research process of identifying  selecting and testing in animals a potential pharmaceutical compound  the clinical development process begins with the filing of an ind 
clinical development typically involves three phases of study phase  and the most significant costs associated with clinical development are incurred in phase trials  which tend to be the longest and largest studies conducted during the drug development process 
after the completion of a successful preclinical and clinical development program  a new drug application nda or biologics license application bla must be filed with the fda  which includes  among other things  very large amounts of preclinical and clinical data and results and manufacturing related information necessary to support requested approval of the product 
the nda bla must be reviewed and approved by the fda 
according to industry statistics  it generally takes to years to research  develop and bring to market a new prescription medicine in the united states 
in light of the steps and complexities involved  the successful development of our potential products is highly uncertain 
actual timelines and costs to develop and commercialize a product are subject to enormous variability and are very difficult to predict  as our clinical development programs are updated and modified to reflect the most recent preclinical and clinical data and other relevant information 
in addition  various statutes and regulations also govern or influence the manufacturing  safety reporting  labeling  storage  record keeping and marketing of each product 
the lengthy process of seeking these regulatory reviews and approvals  and the subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations  require the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals could materially adversely affect our business 
in responding to an nda bla submission  the fda may grant marketing approval  may request additional information  may deny the application if it determines that the application does not provide an adequate basis for approval  and may also refuse to review an application that has been submitted if it determines that the application does not provide an adequate basis for filing and review 
we cannot provide assurance that any approval required by the fda will be obtained on a timely basis  if at all 
for a more complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with completing development of potential products  see the sub section titled because we or our collaborators must obtain regulatory approval to market our products in the united states and other countries  we cannot predict whether or when we will be permitted to commercialize our products and entry into clinical trials with one or more product candidates may not result in any commercially viable products in the section of item entitled additional factors that may affect future results  and elsewhere in this annual report 
acquired in process research technology in march  we entered into an agreement with merix bioscience  inc now argos therapeutics  inc under which we acquired a co exclusive right under patents controlled by argos for the use of defined antigens in therapeutic cancer vaccines 
in conjunction with the agreement  we issued  shares of our common stock to argos 
we acquired rights to the argos technology for commercial development of our therapeutic cancer vaccine 
further development of the technology is required before we can enter into advanced clinical trials for a potential commercial application 
we have concluded that this technology has no alternative future use as defined in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for research and development costs and accordingly  expensed the value of the acquired in process research technology of million at the time of acquisition 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in from was primarily due to the recognition of million of consulting expense associated with the fair value of a warrant issued to a consultant in conjunction with the establishment of ta therapeutics  ltd  our joint venture in hong kong 
the increase in from primarily reflected an increase in patent legal costs of  and an increase in corporate legal and accounting expenses of  for additional regulatory compliance related to the sarbanes oxley act and various equity transactions with vendors 
we currently anticipate general and administrative expenses to remain consistent with current levels 
interest and other income interest income was million  million and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in as compared to was due to increased interest rates and higher cash and investment balances as a result of proceeds received from the public offering in september the increase in as compared to was due to higher cash and investment balances as a result of proceeds received from equity financings in november and also included in interest income for the years ended december   and  was realized losses of   and none  respectively  related to other than temporary declines in value for our equity investments in licensees 
we also received none   and  in research payments under government grants for the years ended december   and  respectively  and recorded these amounts as other income in each year 
we received the final funding payment from our national consortium drug discovery group grant award from the national cancer institute in interest and other expense interest and other expense was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in interest and other expense for compared to was primarily due to the conclusion of interest accretion for the roslin research funding obligation 
the decrease in interest and other expense for compared to was primarily the result of reduced equipment loan obligations 
conversion expense in may  we modified the existing terms of the outstanding  of series d convertible debentures to provide for an automatic conversion into equity on the maturity date  fixed the conversion price at per share and eliminated the interest accrual for the remainder of the term 
in addition  we modified the terms of the related outstanding warrants and changed the exercise prices to per share 
the expiration periods were unchanged 
as a result of this second modification  we recorded  in conversion expense on our consolidated statements of operations 
during may and june  all of the remaining  of series d convertible debentures plus accrued interest of  were converted into  shares of geron common stock 
as of december  and  no series d convertible debentures remained outstanding 
amended series d warrants to purchase  shares of geron common stock expired on july  without having been exercised and amended series d warrants to purchase  shares of geron common stock remained outstanding as of december  net loss net loss was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
absent the acquired in process research technology expense of million  overall net loss for decreased relative to primarily due to increased license fee revenue from the merck and start transactions and interest income  partially offset by higher operating expenses associated with increased scientific headcount and the warrant issuance related to consulting services 
the overall increase in net loss in compared to was primarily the result of the acquired in process research technology expense of million associated with the merix transaction and increased research and development expense associated with the clinical development of grnl 
liquidity and capital resources cash  restricted cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities at december  were million  compared to million at december  and million at december  we have an investment policy to invest these funds in liquid  investment grade securities  such as interest bearing money market funds  corporate notes  commercial paper  asset backed securities and municipal securities 
the increase in cash  restricted cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities in was due to the receipt of million in net cash proceeds from the exercise of warrants  million in proceeds from the sale of common stock to hong kong investors  million in connection with the start licensing  inc joint venture  million in connection with the merck collaboration and million of net proceeds in september from our underwritten public offering of common stock and the exercise of the warrant held by merck 
the increase in cash  restricted cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities in was the result of an equity financing consummated in november which resulted in net cash proceeds of million 
cash flows from operating activities net cash used in operations was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease in net cash used for operations in was primarily the result of increased cash received from interest income and license fees which offset higher operating expenses related to increased scientific headcount 
the increase in net cash used for operations in was primarily the result of increased operating expenses related to the manufacturing and development of grnl 
cash flows from investing activities net cash provided by investing activities was million in  compared to net cash used of million in and million in net cash provided in was a result of increased proceeds from maturities of marketable securities received through various equity financings as described below 
through december   we have invested approximately million in property and equipment  of which approximately million was financed through an equipment financing arrangement 
minimum annual payments due under the equipment financing facility are expected to total  in as of december   we had approximately million available for borrowing under our equipment financing facilities 
the drawdown period under the equipment financing facilities expires in november we intend to renew the commitments for new equipment financing facilities in to further fund equipment purchases 
if we are unable to renew the commitment  we will be obliged to use our own cash resources for capital expenditures 
cash flows from financing activities net cash provided by financing activities in of million reflected the receipt of million in proceeds from the exercise of warrants issued to institutional investors in november  million in proceeds from the sale of our common stock to hong kong investors and million in net proceeds from the underwritten public offering of common stock and the exercise of the merck warrant in september net cash provided by financing activities in of million included the net proceeds from the sale of our common stock and warrants to institutional investors for approximately million 
net cash provided by financing activities in of million reflected the receipt of approximately million in net proceeds from the completion of a public offering of our common stock and of approximately million in net proceeds from the sale of our common stock to two institutional investors 
our contractual obligations for the next five years  and thereafter are as follows 
geron k revbxxjpg 
we estimate that our existing capital resources  interest income and equipment financing facilities will be sufficient to fund our current level of operations through at least december changes in our research and development plans or other changes affecting our operating expenses or cash balances may result in the expenditure of available resources before such time  and in any event  we will need to raise substantial additional capital to fund our operations in the future 
we intend to seek additional funding through strategic collaborations  public or private equity financings  equipment loans or other financing sources that may be available

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk disclosures contains forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
credit risk 
we place our cash  restricted cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities with three financial institutions in the united states 
generally  these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and therefore  bear minimal risk 
deposits with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits 
financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of marketable securities 
marketable securities consist of high grade corporate bonds  asset backed securities and us government agency securities 
our investment policy  approved by our board of directors  limits the amount we may invest in any one type of investment issuer  thereby reducing credit risk concentrations 
interest rate sensitivity 
the fair value of our cash equivalents and marketable securities at december  was million 
these investments include million of cash and cash equivalents which are due in less than days  million of asset backed securities which have varying maturity dates  and million of short term investments which are due in less than one year 
our investment policy is to manage our marketable securities portfolio to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing the return on the investment portfolio through the full investment of available funds 
we diversify the marketable securities portfolio by investing in multiple types of investment grade securities 
we primarily invest our marketable securities portfolio in short term securities with at least an investment grade rating to minimize interest rate and credit risk as well as to provide for an immediate source of funds 
although changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of the marketable securities portfolio and cause unrealized gains or losses  such gains or losses would not be realized unless the investments are sold 
due to the nature of our investments  which are primarily corporate notes  us government agency securities  asset backed securities and money market funds  we have concluded that there is no material market risk exposure 
foreign currency exchange risk 
because we translate foreign currencies into united states dollars for reporting purposes  currency fluctuations can have an impact  though generally immaterial  on our results 
we believe that our exposure to currency exchange fluctuation risk is insignificant primarily because our international subsidiary satisfies its financial obligations almost exclusively in its local currency 
in  there was an immaterial currency exchange impact from our intercompany transactions 
however  our financial obligations to the roslin institute are stated in british pounds sterling over the next months 
this obligation may become more expensive for us if the united states dollar becomes weaker against the british pound sterling 
as of december   we did not engage in foreign currency hedging activities
