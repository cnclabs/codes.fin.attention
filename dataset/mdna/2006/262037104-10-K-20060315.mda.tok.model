item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is management s discussion and analysis of certain significant factors that have affected certain aspects of the company s financial position and results of operations during the periods included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented elsewhere in this report 

table of contents overview dril quip designs  manufactures  sells and services highly engineered offshore drilling and production equipment that is well suited for use in deepwater  harsh environment and severe service applications 
the company designs and manufactures subsea equipment  surface equipment and offshore rig equipment for use by major integrated  large independent and foreign national oil and gas companies in offshore areas throughout the world 
the company s principal products consist of subsea and surface wellheads  subsea and surface production trees  mudline hanger systems  specialty connectors and associated pipe  drilling and production riser systems  wellhead connectors and diverters 
dril quip also provides installation and reconditioning services and rents running tools for use in connection with the installation and retrieval of its products 
both the market for offshore drilling and production equipment and services and the company s business are substantially dependent on the condition of the oil and gas industry and  in particular  the willingness of oil and gas companies to make capital expenditures on exploration  drilling and production operations offshore 
oil and gas prices and the level of offshore drilling and production activity have historically been characterized by significant volatility 
see item a 
risk factors a material or extended decline in expenditures by the oil and gas industry could significantly reduce our revenue and income 
high oil and gas prices in and have resulted in oil operators increasing capital spending for both exploration and development programs 
as various geopolitical issues have limited the ability of oil and gas companies to invest in areas such as russia and the middle east  an increasing amount of this capital spending has been in the deepwater areas in which the company operates 
however  any future decline in oil and gas prices significantly below current levels would likely have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
there can be no assurance that the current oil price levels will lead to increases in exploration and development activity or that demand for the company s products and services will reflect such improvement  if any 
the company operates its business and markets its products and services in all of the significant oil and gas producing areas in the world and is  therefore  subject to the risks customarily attendant to international operations and investments in foreign countries 
these risks include nationalization  expropriation  war  acts of terrorism and civil disturbance  restrictive action by local governments  limitation on repatriation of earnings  change in foreign tax laws and change in currency exchange rates  any of which could have an adverse effect on either the company s ability to manufacture its products in its facilities abroad or the demand in certain regions for the company s products or both 
to date  the company has not experienced any significant problems in foreign countries arising from local government actions or political instability  but there is no assurance that such problems will not arise in the future 
interruption of the company s international operations could have a material adverse effect on its overall operations 
see item a 
risk factors our international operations expose us to instability and changes in economic and political conditions and other risks inherent to international business  which could have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition 
dril quip s revenues are generated from two sources products and services 
product revenues are derived from the sale of offshore drilling and production equipment  and service revenues are earned when the company provides installation and reconditioning services as well as rental running tools for installation and retrieval of its products 
in  the company derived of its revenues from the sale of its products and of its revenues from services 
service revenues generally correlate to revenues from product sales  because increased product sales generate increased revenues from installation services and rental running tools 
the company has substantial international operations  with approximately  and of its revenues derived from foreign sales in  and  respectively 
on the basis of revenues generated  approximately  and of all products sold were manufactured in the united states during  and  respectively 
generally  the company attempts to raise its prices as its costs increase 
however  the actual pricing of the company s products and services is impacted by a number of factors  including competitive pricing pressure  underutilized capacity in the oil service sector  maintenance of market share  the introduction of new products and general market conditions 

table of contents the company accounts for larger and more complex projects that have relatively longer manufacturing time frames on a percentage of completion basis 
during  four projects representing approximately of the company s revenue were accounted for using percentage of completion accounting 
this percentage may fluctuate in the future 
revenues accounted for in this manner are generally recognized on the ratio of costs incurred to the total estimated costs 
accordingly  price and cost estimates are reviewed periodically as the work progresses  and adjustments proportionate to the percentage of completion are reflected in the period when such estimates are revised 
amounts received from customers in excess of revenues recognized are classified as a current liability 
see item a 
risk factors we may be required to recognize a charge against earnings because of percentage of completion accounting 
the principal elements of cost of sales are labor  raw materials and manufacturing overhead 
variable costs  such as labor  raw materials  supplies and energy  generally account for approximately two thirds of the company s cost of sales 
the company has experienced increased labor costs over the past few years due to the limited supply of skilled workers and during has begun to experience significant increases in raw material costs 
fixed costs  such as the fixed portion of manufacturing overhead  constitute the remainder of the company s cost of sales 
the company continually seeks to improve its efficiency and cost position 
cost of sales as a percentage of revenues is also influenced by the product mix sold in any particular quarter and market conditions 
the company s costs related to its foreign operations do not significantly differ from its domestic costs

liquidity and capital resources the primary liquidity needs of the company are i to fund capital expenditures to improve and expand facilities and manufacture additional rental running tools and ii to fund working capital 
historically  the company s principal sources of funds have been cash flows from operations and bank indebtedness 
in december  the company sold  shares of common stock which resulted in net proceeds to the company  before expenses  of  net cash provided by operating activities was million and million in and  respectively 
net cash used by operating activities was million in during  net cash used in operating activities resulted primarily from increases in trade receivables and inventories offset by increases in trade accounts payable and accrued expenses  depreciation and amortization and net income 
the increases in receivables  inventories and payables were primarily due to the company s significant increases in revenues and backlog during the year 
capital expenditures by the company were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
capital expenditure increases during and were primarily due to expenditures related to the expansion of the company s houston forging facility as well as costs associated with running tools and equipment needed in the development and marketing of the company s new liner hanger and subsea controls product lines 
principal payments on long term debt were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the reduction in long term debt during on the company s revolving line of credit was due primarily to net cash provided by the sale of million shares of common stock in the fourth quarter of 
table of contents the following table presents long term contractual obligations of the company and the related payments  excluding the effects of interest  due in total and by year as of december  payments due by year contractual obligations after total in thousands long term debt maturities operating lease obligations total the company has a credit facility with guaranty bank  fsb providing an unsecured revolving line of credit of up to million 
at the option of the company  borrowing under this facility bears interest at either a rate equal to libor london interbank offered rate plus or the guaranty bank base rate 
the facility calls for quarterly interest payments and terminates on june  the facility also contains certain covenants including maintaining minimum tangible net worth levels  not exceeding specified funded debt amounts and required interest coverage ratios 
the company is in compliance with all loan covenants 
as of december   the company had drawn down million under this facility for operating activities and capital expenditures 
as of december   the company had no borrowings under this facility 
dril quip europe limited has a credit agreement with the bank of scotland dated march  in the original amount of uk pounds sterling million approximately us million 
borrowing under this facility bears interest at the bank of scotland base rate  which was at december   plus  and is repayable in equal monthly installments  plus interest 
substantially all of this facility was used to finance capital expenditures in norway 
the outstanding balance of this facility at december  and was approximately us million and us million  respectively 
the facility is secured by land and buildings in aberdeen  scotland and contains no restrictive financial covenants 
the secured term loan dril quip asia pacific pte ltd 
had with the overseas union bank dated august  in the original amount of singapore dollars million approximately us million was paid in full on december in addition to the above  the company has issued purchase orders in the ordinary course of business for the purchase of goods and services 
these purchase orders are enforceable and legally binding 
however  none of the company s purchase obligations call for deliveries of goods or services for time periods in excess of one year 
the company has filed with the sec a universal shelf registration statement that  subject to the agreement on terms at the time of use and appropriate supplementation  allows the company to issue  in one or more offerings  up to million of common stock  preferred stock  debt securities  warrants or a combination thereof 
in december  the company issued million in common stock million shares  resulting in net proceeds to the company  before expenses  of 
at december   the company had million available under this shelf registration  subject to customary market terms and conditions 
the company believes that cash generated from operations plus cash on hand and its existing line of credit will be sufficient to fund operations  working capital needs and anticipated capital expenditure requirements in however  any significant future declines in hydrocarbon prices below historical levels could have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity 
should market conditions result in unexpected cash requirements  the company believes that additional borrowing from commercial lending institutions would be readily available and more than adequate to meet such requirements 
backlog backlog consists of firm customer orders for which a purchase order has been received  satisfactory credit or financing arrangements exist and delivery is scheduled 
the company s revenues for a specific period have not been directly related to its backlog as stated at a particular point in time 
the company s backlog was approximately million at december   an increase of million or over the backlog of million at december 
table of contents this increase in backlog is primarily due to improving worldwide market conditions resulting in increased demand for the company s products 
the company expects to fill approximately of the december  backlog by december  the remaining backlog at december  consists of longer term projects which are being designed and manufactured to customer specifications requiring longer lead times 
the company can give no assurance that backlog will remain at current levels 
sales of the company s products are affected by prices for oil and natural gas  which fluctuated significantly during and significant future declines in oil and natural gas prices could reduce new customer orders  which would cause the company s backlog to decline 
all of the company s projects currently included in its backlog are subject to change and or termination at the option of the customer 
in the case of a change or termination  the customer is required to pay the company for work performed and other costs necessarily incurred as a result of the change or termination 
in the past  terminations and cancellations have been immaterial to the company s overall operating results 
geographic segments the company s operations are organized into three geographic segments western hemisphere including north and south america  headquartered in houston  texas  eastern hemisphere including europe and africa  headquartered in aberdeen  scotland and asia pacific including the pacific rim  southeast asia  australia  india and the middle east  headquartered in singapore 
each of these segments sells similar products and services and the company has major manufacturing facilities in all three of its headquarter locations 
the company previously reported a single industry segment and disclosed certain geographic financial information 
all periods presented herein have been revised to present geographic segment information 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
revenues for each of these segments are dependent upon the ultimate sale of products and services to the company s customers 
for information on revenues by geographic segment  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
revenues of the western hemisphere are also influenced by its sale of products to the eastern hemisphere and asia pacific segments 
accordingly  the operating incomes of each area are closely tied to third party sales  and the operating income of the western hemisphere is also dependent upon its level of intercompany sales 
currency risk through its subsidiaries  the company conducts a portion of business in currencies other than the united states dollar  principally the british pound sterling and  to a lesser extent the brazilian real 
the company generally attempts to minimize its currency exchange risk by seeking international contracts payable in local currency in amounts equal to the company s estimated operating costs payable in local currency and in us dollars for the balance of the contract 
because of this strategy  the company has not experienced significant transaction gains or losses associated with changes in currency exchange rates and does not anticipate such exposure to be material in the future 
in  and  the company had  net of income taxes  a gain of approximately   and a loss of  respectively 
the gains in and and the loss in were the result of currency fluctuations related to payables and trade receivables 
there is no assurance that the company will be able to protect itself against such fluctuations in the future 
historically  the company has not conducted business in countries that limit repatriation of earnings 
however  as the company expands its international operations  it may begin operating in countries that have such limitations 
further  there can be no assurance that the countries in which the company currently operates will not adopt policies limiting repatriation of earnings in the future 
the company also has significant investments in countries other than the united states  principally its manufacturing operations in aberdeen  scotland and  to a lesser extent  singapore  brazil and norway 
the functional currency of these foreign operations is the local currency and  accordingly  financial statement assets and liabilities are translated at current exchange rates 
resulting translation adjustments are reflected as a separate component of stockholders equity and have no current effect on earnings or cash flow 

table of contents critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
the company believes the following accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
for the majority of the company s sales  revenue is recorded at the time the manufacturing process is complete and the products have been shipped to the consumer 
for these sales  ownership is transferred to the customer at the time of shipment 
service revenues are recorded at the time the service is rendered 
certain revenues are derived from long term contracts  which generally require more than one year to fulfill 
revenues and cost of sales and related profits from long term contracts are recognized under the percentage of completion method based on the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs 
during  four projects representing approximately of the company s revenue were accounted for using percentage of completion accounting 
losses on long term contracts are recognized when they become known 
contracts for long term projects usually contain provisions for customer progress payments 
payments and billings in excess of revenues recognized are deferred and are included as a customer prepayment liability 
allowances on accounts receivable are provided primarily on the specific identification method 
inventories 
inventory costs are determined principally by the use of the first in  first out fifo method  and are stated at the lower of cost or market 
inventory is valued principally using standard costs that are calculated based upon direct costs incurred and overhead allocations 
periodically  obsolescence reviews are performed on slow moving inventories and reserves are established based on current assessments about future demands and market conditions 
the inventory values have been reduced by a reserve for excess and obsolete inventories 
inventory reserves of million and million were recorded as of december  and  respectively 
if market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory reserves may be required 
contingent liabilities 
we establish reserves for estimated loss contingencies when we believe a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
revisions to contingent liabilities are reflected in income in the period in which different facts or information become known or circumstances change that affect our previous assumptions with respect to the likelihood or amount of loss 
reserves for contingent liabilities are based upon our assumptions and estimates regarding the probable outcome of the matter 
should the outcome differ from our assumptions and estimates  revisions to the estimated reserves for contingent liabilities would be required 
the company has no significant derivative instruments and no off balance sheet hedging or financing arrangements or contracts or operations that rely upon credit or similar ratings 
new accounting standards in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 inventory costs sfas 
sfas is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  the company believes that there will be no material effect on its financial statements upon adoption of this statement 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
r  share based payments 
this statement is a revision of sfas statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related implementation guidance 
sfas no 
r addresses all forms of share based payment sbp awards including shares issued under 
table of contents employee stock purchase plans  stock options  restricted stock and stock appreciation rights 
under sfas no 
r  sbp awards result in a cost that will be measured at fair value on the awards grant date  based on the estimated number of awards that are expected to vest and will be reflected as compensation expense in the financial statements 
in addition  this statement will apply to unvested options granted prior to the effective date 
this new standard is effective in interim and annual reporting periods that begin after december  the company currently estimates that it will recognize approximately per diluted share of equity and option based compensation expense for  assuming the use of the fair value method and the use of a black scholes option pricing model 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is currently exposed to certain market risks related to interest rate changes and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
the company does not engage in any material hedging transactions  forward contracts or currency trading which could be subject to market risks inherent to such transactions 
foreign exchange rate risk through its subsidiaries  the company conducts a portion of its business in currencies other than the united states dollar  principally the british pound sterling and  to a lesser extent  the brazilian real 
the company has not experienced significant transaction gains or losses associated with changes in currency exchange rates and does not anticipate such exposure to be material in the future 
however  there is no assurance that the company will be able to protect itself against currency fluctuations in the future 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations currency risk in item of this report 
the company uses a sensitivity analysis model to measure the impact on revenue and net income of a adverse movement of foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar over the previous year 
based upon this model  a decrease would result in a decrease in revenues of approximately million and a decrease in net income of approximately million over this period 
there can be no assurance that the exchange rate decrease projected above will materialize as fluctuations in exchange rates are beyond the company s control 
interest rate risk as described in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources  the company has two credit facilities or loans that require the company to pay interest at a floating rate 
these floating rate obligations expose the company to the risk of increased interest expense in the event of increases in the short term interest rates 
based upon the december  balance of approximately million related to these floating rate obligations  each rise in interest rates would result in additional annual interest expense to the company of approximately  or  per quarter
