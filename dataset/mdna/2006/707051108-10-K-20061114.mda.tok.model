item business description of business penford corporation which  together with its subsidiary companies  is referred to herein as penford or the company is a developer  manufacturer and marketer of specialty natural based ingredient systems for industrial and food applications 
penford corporation is a washington corporation originally incorporated in september the company commenced operations as a publicly traded company on march  the company uses its carbohydrate chemistry expertise to develop ingredients with starch as a base for value added applications in several markets including papermaking and food products 
the company manages its business in three segments 
the first two  industrial ingredients and food ingredients are  broad categories of end market users  primarily served by the company s us operations 
the third segment consists of geographically separate operations in australia and new zealand 
the australian and new zealand operations are engaged primarily in the food ingredients business 
financial information about penford s segments and geographic areas is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
penford s family of products provides functional characteristics to customers products 
carbohydrate based specialty starches possess binding and film forming attributes that provide convenient and cost effective solutions that make customers products perform better 
the company has extensive research and development capabilities  which are used in understanding the complex chemistry of carbohydrate based materials and their application 
penford has specialty processing capabilities for a variety of modified starches 
specialty products for industrial applications are designed to improve the strength and quality of customers products and efficiencies in the manufacture of coated and uncoated paper and paper packaging products 
these starches are principally 
table of contents ethylated chemically modified with ethylene oxide  oxidized treated with sodium hypochlorite and cationic carrying a positive electrical charge 
ethylated and oxidized starches are used in coatings and as binders  providing strength and printability to fine white  magazine and catalog paper 
cationic and other liquid starches are generally used in the paper forming process in paper production  providing strong bonding of paper fibers and other ingredients 
penford s products are a cost effective alternative to synthetic ingredients 
specialty starches produced for food applications are used in coatings to provide crispness  improved taste and texture  and increased product life for products such as french fries sold in quick service restaurants 
food grade starch products are also used as moisture binders to reduce fat levels  modify texture and improve color and consistency in a variety of foods such as canned products  sauces  whole and processed meats  dry powdered mixes and other food and bakery products 
in june  the company announced plans to invest million for up to million gallons of ethanol production capacity per year at its cedar rapids  iowa facility 
the company currently expects the facility to be producing ethanol by the end of calendar penford has much of the infrastructure within the cedar rapids plant to participate in the ethanol market with sufficient grain handling  separation processes  utilities and logistic capabilities 
the existing factory is centrally located near rail and ground transport arteries and the ethanol facility will occupy available space within the existing site footprint 
in october  penford refinanced its credit facility and obtained a million capital expansion loan commitment maturing december to finance construction of the ethanol plant 
in november  penford sold certain assets of its resistant starch business to national starch corporation national starch for million 
in fiscal  penford also exclusively licensed to national starch certain rights to its resistant starch patent portfolio the rs patents for applications in human nutrition 
under the terms of the agreements  penford received an initial licensing fee of million and will receive annual royalties for a period of seven years or until a maximum of million in royalties has been received by penford 
the licensing fee is being amortized over the life of the agreement 
the royalty payments are subject to a minimum of million over the first five years of the licensing agreement 
on september   in connection with the settlement of litigation in which penford s australian subsidiary companies were plaintiffs  penford granted to cargill incorporated cargill  in exchange for a one time payment  a license under the rs patents in certain non human nutrition applications 
in addition  penford entered into an agreement with cargill and national starch pursuant to which national starch granted to cargill a sublicense  with royalties payable to penford  of rights under the rs patents in human nutrition applications 
as part of the settlement agreement  penford will receive certain other benefits  including an acceleration and extension of certain royalties under its license with national starch 
raw materials corn penford s north american corn wet milling plant is located in cedar rapids  iowa  the middle of the us corn belt 
accordingly  the plant has truck delivered corn available throughout the year from a number of suppliers at prices consistent with those available in the major us grain markets 
penford australia s corn wet milling facilities in lane cove  australia  and auckland  new zealand are sourced through truck delivered corn at contracted prices with regional independent farmers and merchants 
the corn sourced in australia and new zealand is contracted prior to harvest march june 
corn used in australia is purchased and stored for use in both the current and following year 
the corn sourced in new zealand is purchased forward for future delivery 
corn is also purchased from australia as necessary to supplement the corn sourced and processed in new zealand 
potato starch the company s facilities in idaho falls  idaho  richland  washington  and plover  wisconsin use starch recovered as by products from potato processors as the primary raw material to manufacture modified potato starches 
the company enters into contracts typically having durations of one to three years with potato processors in the united states  canada and mexico to acquire potato based raw materials 

table of contents wheat products penford australia s tamworth facility uses wheat flour as the primary raw material for the production of its wheat products  including wheat starch  wheat gluten and glucose syrup 
tanker trucks from a local flour mill currently supply wheat flour under a four year supply agreement which expires in december chemicals the primary chemicals used in the manufacturing processes are readily available commodity chemicals 
the prices for these chemicals are subject to price fluctuations due to market conditions 
natural gas the primary energy source for most of penford s plants is natural gas 
penford contracts its natural gas supply with regional suppliers  generally under short term supply agreements  and at times uses futures contracts to hedge the price of natural gas in north america 
in august  the company entered into a contract with a regional supplier of methane gas from a landfill near the cedar rapids  iowa facility 
this fuel provides a portion of the energy required to generate power for the manufacturing plant 
corn  potato starch  wheat flour  chemicals and natural gas are not presently subject to availability constraints  although drought conditions in australia have periodically impacted the prices of corn and wheat in that area and strong demand has substantially increased natural gas and chemical prices 
although supplies are readily available  current forecasts for wheat production in australia indicate that the existing drought will impact the future price for that raw material 
penford s current potato starch requirements constitute a material portion of the available north american supply 
penford estimates that it purchases approximately of the recovered potato starch in north america 
it is possible that  in the long term  continued growth in demand for potato starch based ingredients and new product development could result in capacity constraints 
over half of the company s manufacturing costs arise from the costs of corn  potato starch  wheat flour  chemicals and natural gas 
the remaining portion consists of the costs of labor  distribution  depreciation and maintenance of manufacturing plant and equipment  and other utilities 
the prices of raw materials may fluctuate  and increases in prices may affect penford s business adversely 
to mitigate this risk  penford hedges a portion of corn and gas purchases with futures and options contracts in the us and enters into short term supply agreements for other production requirements in all locations 
research and development penford s research and development efforts cover a range of projects including technical service work focused on specific customer support projects requiring coordination with customers research efforts to develop innovative solutions to specific customer requirements 
these projects are supplemented with longer term  new product development and commercialization initiatives 
research and development expenses were million  million and million for fiscal years ended august   and  respectively 
at the end of fiscal  penford had scientists  including seven phd s who comprise a body of expert knowledge of carbohydrate characteristics and chemistry 
patents  trademarks and tradenames penford owns a number of patents  trademarks and tradenames 
penford has approximately current patents and pending patent applications  most of which are related to technologies in french fry coatings  coatings for the paper industry and high amylose resistant starch 
penford s issued patents expire at various times between and the annual cost to renew all of the company s patents is approximately million 
however  most of penford s products are currently made with technology that is broadly available to companies that have the same level of scientific expertise and production capabilities as penford 
specialty starch ingredient brand names for industrial applications include  among others  penford gums  pensize binders  penflex sizing agent  topcat cationic additive and the apollo starch series 
product brand names for food ingredient applications include penbind  pencling  penplus  cantab  maps tm  mazaca tm and fieldcleer tm 

table of contents quarterly fluctuations penford s revenues and operating results vary from quarter to quarter 
in particular  the company experiences seasonality in its australian operations 
the company has lower sales volumes and gross margins in australia and new zealand s summer months  which occur during penford s second fiscal quarter 
this seasonal decline is caused by the closure of some customers plants for public holidays and maintenance during this period 
decreased consumption of some foods which use the company s products  such as packaged bread  also contributes to this seasonal trend 
sales volumes of the food ingredients north america products used in french fry coatings are also generally lower during penford s second fiscal quarter due to decreased consumption of french fries during the post holiday season 
working capital penford generally carries a one to day supply of materials required for production  depending on the lead time for specific items 
penford manufactures finished goods to customer orders or anticipated demand 
the company is therefore able to carry less than a day supply of most products 
terms for trade receivables and trade payables are standard for the industry and region and generally do not exceed day terms except for trade receivables for export sales 
environmental matters penford s operations are governed by various federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws and regulations

the program is managed by the corporate director of environmental  health and safety and is designed to structure the conduct of penford s business in a safe and fiscally responsible manner that protects and preserves the health and safety of employees  the communities surrounding the company s plants  and the environment 
the company continuously monitors environmental legislation and regulations which may affect penford s operations 
during fiscal  there have been no material impacts on the company s operations resulting from compliance with environmental regulations 
no unusual expenditures for environmental facilities and programs are anticipated in the coming year 
principal customers penford sells to a variety of customers and has several relatively large customers in each business segment 
however  over the last three years penford has had no customers that annually purchased its products in amounts in excess of of sales 
competition in its primary markets  penford competes directly with approximately five other companies that manufacture specialty starches for the papermaking industry and approximately six other companies that manufacture specialty 
table of contents food ingredients 
penford competes indirectly with a larger number of companies that provide synthetic and natural based ingredients to industrial and food customers 
some of these competitors are larger companies  and have greater financial and technical resources than penford 
application expertise  quality and service are the major competitive advantages for penford 
employees at august   penford had total employees 
in north america  penford had employees  of which approximately are members of a trade union 
the collective bargaining agreement covering the cedar rapids based manufacturing workforce expires in august penford australia had employees  of which are members of trade unions in australia and new zealand 
the union contracts for the lane cove  australia  and the new zealand facilities have expiration dates of december and april  respectively 
the tamworth  australia  union agreement expired in september and is currently being renegotiated 
the company does not expect any significant issues in renewing the contract 
sales and distribution sales are generated using a combination of direct sales and distributor agreements 
in many cases  penford supports its sales efforts with technical and advisory assistance to customers 
penford generally ships its products upon receipt of purchase orders from its customers and  consequently  backlog is not significant 
customers for industrial corn based starch ingredients purchase products through fixed price contracts or formula priced contracts for periods covering three months to two years or on a spot basis 
in fiscal  approximately of these sales were under fixed price contracts  with representing formula price and spot business 
since penford s customers are generally other manufacturers and processors  most of the company s products are distributed via rail or truck to customer facilities in bulk  except in australia and new zealand where most dry product is packaged in kg bags 
foreign operations and export sales penford further expanded into foreign markets with its acquisition of penford australia in september penford australia is the primary producer of corn starch products in australia and new zealand 
penford australia manufactures products used to enhance the quality of packaged food products  generally through providing the texture and viscosity required by its customers for products such as sauces and gravies 
penford australia s starch products are also used in industrial applications including mining  paper  corrugating and building materials 
the company s operations in australia and new zealand include three manufacturing facilities for processing specialty corn starches and wheat related products 
competition is mainly from imported products  except in wheat flour based starches where there is one other producer in australia 
export sales from penford s businesses in the us and australia new zealand accounted for approximately  and of total sales in fiscal  and  respectively

item a risk factors increases in energy and chemical costs may reduce the company s profitability 
energy and chemicals comprised approximately and  respectively  of the cost of manufacturing the company s products in fiscal year natural gas is used extensively in the industrial ingredients north america business to dry starch products  and  to a lesser extent  in the company s other business segments 
chemicals are used in all of penford s businesses to modify starch for specific product applications and customer requirements 
the prices of these inputs to the manufacturing process fluctuate based on anticipated changes in supply and demand  weather and the prices of alternative fuels  including petroleum 
penford may use short term purchase contracts or exchange traded futures or option contracts to reduce the price volatility of natural gas  however  these strategies are not available for the chemicals the company purchases 
penford may not be able to pass on increases in energy and chemical costs to its customers and margins and profitability would be adversely affected 
the availability and cost of agricultural products penford purchases are vulnerable to weather and other factors beyond its control 
in fiscal  approximately of penford s manufacturing costs were the costs of agricultural raw materials  corn  wheat flour and maize 
weather conditions  plantings and global supply  among other things  have historically caused volatility in the supply and prices of these agricultural products 
the company may not be able to pass through the increases in the cost of agricultural raw materials to its customers 
to manage price volatility in the commodity markets  the company may purchase inventory in advance or enter into exchange traded futures or options contracts 
despite these hedging activities  penford may not be successful in limiting its exposure to market fluctuations in the cost of agricultural raw materials 
increases in the cost of corn  wheat flour  maize and potato starch due to weather conditions or other factors beyond penford s control and that cannot be passed through to customers will reduce penford s future profitability 
the loss of a major customer could have an adverse effect on penford s results of operations 
none of the company s customers constituted of sales in the last three years 
however  in fiscal year  sales to the top ten customers and sales to the largest customer represented and  respectively  of total consolidated net sales 
customers place orders on an as needed basis and generally can change their suppliers without penalty 
if the company lost one or more of its major customers  or if one or more of its customers significantly reduced its orders  sales and results of operations would be adversely affected

significant changes in these interest rates would materially affect penford s profitability 
unanticipated changes in tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect penford s profitability 
penford is subject to income taxes in the united states  australia and new zealand 
the company s effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates  changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws 
the carrying value of deferred tax assets  which are predominantly in the united states  is dependent on penford s ability to generate future taxable income in the united states 
the amount of income taxes paid is subject to the company s interpretation of applicable tax laws in the jurisdictions in which penford operates 
the company is subject to audits by tax authorities 
while the company believes it has complied with all applicable income tax laws  there can be no assurance that a tax authority will not have a different interpretation of the law or that any additional taxes imposed as a result of tax audits will not have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
profitability is subject to risks associated with changes in foreign exchange currency rates 
in the ordinary course of business  penford is subject to risks associated with changing foreign exchange rates

provisions of washington law could discourage or prevent a potential takeover 
washington law imposes restrictions on certain transactions between a corporation and certain significant shareholders 
the washington business corporation act generally prohibits a target corporation from engaging in certain significant business transactions with an acquiring person  which is defined as a person or group of persons that beneficially owns or more of the voting securities of the target corporation  for a period of five years after such acquisition  unless the transaction or acquisition of shares is approved by a majority of the members of the target corporation s board of directors prior to the time of the acquisition 
such prohibited transactions include  among other things  a merger or consolidation with  disposition of assets to  or issuance or redemption of stock to or from  the acquiring person  a termination of or more of the employees of the target corporation as a result of the acquiring person s acquisition of or more of the shares  and allowing the acquiring person to receive any disproportionate benefit as a shareholder 
after the five year period  a significant business transaction may occur if it complies with fair price provisions specified in the statute 
a corporation may not opt out of this statute 
this provision may have the effect of delaying  deterring or preventing a change of control in the ownership of the company 
the company may not be able to implement ethanol production as planned or at all 
penford s ability to implement ethanol production as planned is subject to uncertainty 
the company recently announced this project and a considerable amount of work is only in preliminary stages 
as of august   the company had not yet secured all necessary permits and had not entered into all necessary engineering  construction and procurement contracts 
the company has secured million of financing for this project which it believes is adequate for completion  however  the company could face financial risks if this amount of financing is not sufficient to complete the construction of the ethanol facility

table of contents dividends in fiscal  penford paid dividends on its common stock of million at a quarterly rate of per share 
on october   the board of directors declared a dividend of per common share payable on december  to shareholders of record as of november  on a periodic basis  the board of directors reviews the company s dividend policy which is impacted by the company s earnings  financial condition and cash and capital requirements 
future dividend payments are at the discretion of the board of directors 
penford has included the continuation of quarterly dividends in its planning for fiscal critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
these accounting principles require management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions to fairly present results of operations and financial position 
management believes that its estimates  judgments and assumptions are reasonable based upon information available at the time this report was prepared 
to the extent there are material differences between estimates  judgments and assumptions and the actual results  the financial statements will be affected 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is significantly dictated by generally accepted accounting principles and does not require judgment or estimates 
there are also areas in which management s judgments in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result 
management has reviewed the accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit committee 
the notes to the consolidated financial statements contain a summary of the company s accounting policies 
the accounting policies that management believes are the most important to the financial statements and that require the most difficult  subjective and complex judgments include the following evaluation of the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable hedging activities benefit plans valuation of goodwill self insurance program income taxes stock based compensation a description of each of these follows evaluation of the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable management makes judgments about the company s ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for the portion of receivables that the company may not be able to collect 
penford estimates the allowance for uncollectible accounts based on historical experience  known troubled accounts  industry trends  economic conditions  how recently payments have been received  and ongoing credit evaluations of its customers 
if the estimates do not reflect the company s future ability to collect outstanding invoices  penford may experience losses in excess of the reserves established 
at august   the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was million 
hedging activities penford uses derivative instruments  primarily futures contacts  to reduce exposure to price fluctuations of commodities used in the manufacturing processes in the united states 
penford has elected to designate substantially all of these activities as hedges 
this election allows the company to defer gains and losses on those derivative instruments until the underlying commodity is used in the production process 
to reduce exposure to variable short term interest rates  penford uses interest rate swap agreements 

table of contents the requirements for the designation of hedges are very complex  and require judgments and analysis to qualify as hedges as defined by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended sfas no 

these judgments and analyses include an assessment that the derivative instruments used are effective hedges of the underlying risks 
if the company were to fail to meet the requirements of sfas no 
 or if these derivative instruments are not designated as hedges  the company would be required to mark these contracts to market at each reporting date 
penford had deferred gains losses  net of tax of  and  at august  and  respectively  which are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income in both years 
benefit plans penford has defined benefit plans for its us employees providing retirement benefits and coverage for retiree health care 
qualified actuaries determine the estimated cost of these plans annually 
these actuarial estimates are based on assumptions of the discount rate used to calculate the present value of future payments  the expected investment return on plan assets  the estimate of future increases in compensation rates and the estimate of increases in the cost of medical care 
the company makes judgments about these assumptions based on historical investment results and experience as well as available historical market data and trends 
however  if these assumptions are wrong  it could materially affect the amounts reported in the financial statements 
disclosure about these estimates and assumptions are included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
see defined benefit plans in this item valuation of goodwill penford is required to assess on an annual basis  whether the value of goodwill reported on the balance sheet has been impaired  or more often if conditions exist that indicate that there might be an impairment 
these assessments require extensive and subjective judgments to assess the fair value of goodwill 
while the company engages qualified valuation experts to assist in this process  their work is based on the company s estimates of future operating results and allocation of goodwill to the business units 
if future operating results differ materially from the estimates  the value of goodwill could be adversely impacted 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
self insurance program the company maintains a self insurance program covering portions of workers compensation and group health liability costs 
the amounts in excess of the self insured levels are fully insured by third party insurers 
liabilities associated with these risks are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience  severity factors and other actuarial assumptions 
projections of future losses are inherently uncertain because of the random nature of insurance claims occurrences and changes that could occur in actuarial assumptions 
the financial results of the company could be significantly affected if future claims and assumptions differ from those used in determining the liabilities 
income taxes the determination of the company s provision for income taxes requires significant judgment  the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws 
the company s provision for income taxes reflects a combination of income earned and taxed in the various us federal and state  as well as australian and new zealand taxing jurisdictions 
jurisdictional tax law changes  increases or decreases in permanent differences between book and tax items  accruals or adjustments of accruals for tax contingencies or valuation allowances  and the company s change in the mix of earnings from these taxing jurisdictions all affect the overall effective tax rate 
in evaluating the exposures connected with the various tax filing positions  the company establishes an accrual  when  despite management s belief that the company s tax return positions are supportable  management believes that certain positions may be successfully challenged and a loss is probable 
when facts and circumstances change  these accruals are adjusted 

table of contents stock based compensation beginning september   the company recognizes stock based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r  share based payment 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period of the award 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of the share based awards at the date of grant requires judgment  including estimating stock price volatility  forfeiture rates  the risk free interest rate  dividends and expected option life 
if circumstances change  and the company uses different assumptions for volatility  interest  dividends and option life in estimating the fair value of stock based awards granted in future periods  stock based compensation expense may differ significantly from the expense recorded in the current period 
sfas no 
r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the date of grant and revised in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimated 
therefore  if actual forfeiture rates differ significantly from those estimated  the company s results of operations could be materially impacted 
contractual obligations as more fully described in notes and to the consolidated financial statements  the company is a party to various debt and lease agreements at august  that contractually commit the company to pay certain amounts in the future 
the purchase obligations at august  represent an estimate of all open purchase orders and contractual obligations through the company s normal course of business for commitments to purchase goods and services for production and inventory needs  such as raw materials  supplies  manufacturing arrangements  capital expenditures and maintenance 
the majority of terms allow the company or suppliers the option to cancel or adjust the requirements based on business needs 
the following table summarizes such contractual commitments after total long term debt and capital lease obligations short term borrowings operating lease obligations purchase obligations defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans penford maintains defined benefit pension plans and defined benefit postretirement health care plans in the us the most significant assumptions used to determine benefit expense and benefit obligations are the discount rate and the expected return on assets assumption 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for the assumptions used by penford 
the discount rate used by the company in determining benefit expense and benefit obligations reflects the yield of high quality aa or better rating by a recognized rating agency corporate bonds whose cash flows are expected to match the timing and amounts of projected future benefit payments 
benefit obligations and expense increase as the discount rate is reduced 
the discount rates to determine net periodic expense used in  and reflect the decline in bond yields over the past several years 
lowering the discount rate by would increase pension expense by approximately million and other postretirement benefit expense by million 
during fiscal  bond yields rose and penford has increased the discount rate for calculating its benefit obligations at august   as well as net periodic expense for fiscal  to 
the expected long term return on assets assumption for the pension plans represents the average rate of return to be earned on plan assets over the period the benefits included in the benefit obligation are to be paid 
pension 
table of contents expense increases as the expected return on plan assets decreases 
in developing the expected rate of return  the company considers long term historical market rates of return as well as actual returns on the company s plan assets  and adjusts this information to reflect expected capital market trends 
penford also considers forward looking return expectations by asset class  the contribution of active management and management fees paid by the plans 
the plan assets are held in qualified trusts and anticipated rates of return are not reduced for income taxes 
the expected long term return on assets assumption used to calculate net periodic pension expense was for fiscal a decrease increase in the expected return on assets assumptions would increase decrease pension expense by approximately million based on plan assets at august  the expected return on plan assets used in calculating fiscal pension expense is 
unrecognized net loss amounts reflect the difference between expected and actual returns on pension plan assets as well as the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions 
unrecognized net losses in excess of certain thresholds are amortized into net periodic pension and postretirement benefit expense over the average remaining service life of active employees 
as of august   unrecognized losses from all sources are million for the pension plans and million for the postretirement health care plan 
amortization of unrecognized net loss amounts is expected to increase net pension expense by approximately million in fiscal amortization of unrecognized net losses is not expected to impact the net postretirement health care expense in fiscal penford recognized pension expense of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
penford expects pension expense to be approximately million in fiscal the company contributed million  million and million to the pension plans in fiscal  and  respectively 
penford estimates that it will be required to make minimum contributions to the pension plans of million during fiscal the company recognized benefit expense for its postretirement health care plan of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
penford expects to recognize approximately million in postretirement health care benefit expense in fiscal the company contributed million  million  and million in fiscal  and to the postretirement health care plans and estimates that it will contribute million in fiscal future changes in plan asset returns  assumed discount rates and various assumptions related to the participants in the defined benefit plans will impact future benefit expense and liabilities
