item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this form k 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties  and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including  but not limited to  those set forth under risk factors and elsewhere in this form k 
about this management s discussion and analysis the discussion and analysis that follows is organized to provide an overview of our business  describe selected key metrics evaluated by management  explain the year over year trends in our results of operations  describe our liquidity and capital resources  and explain our critical accounting policies  describe certain line items of our statements of operations  and define certain other terms we use in our discussion and analysis 
readers who are not familiar with our company or the financial statements of federal government information technology services providers should closely review the description of critical accounting policies  the description of statement of operations items  and the definition of certain terms used in this management s discussion and analysis sections that appear at the end of this discussion and analysis 
these sections provide background information that can help readers in understanding and analyzing our financial information 
overview we provide technology and strategic consulting services and solutions primarily to the federal government 
our service offerings include strategic consulting  systems design  development and integration  and outsourcing and managed services 
in addition  to address recurring client needs  we develop business solutions for contingency and disaster response planning  information assurance  business intelligence  privacy protection  enterprise architecture  infrastructure management  and wireless integration 
we provide services in three target markets national security  which includes the defense and intelligence communities  civil government  and health care and public health 
since our founding in we have derived substantially all of our revenue from services provided to federal government clients 
we expect that federal government clients will continue to account for substantially all of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
input expects the contracted portion of the federal information technology budget to grow at a compound annual growth rate of over the next five years 
in order to grow more rapidly than the market  we will need to take market share from our competitors 
our growth is driven in part by contract awards and how we build out our contracts 
ideally  the level of quarterly business awards would exceed the revenue booked in the quarter to drive backlog growth 
we work with the federal government under three primary contract types cost plus fee  time and materials  and fixed price contracts 
cost plus fee contracts are typically lower risk arrangements and thus yield lower profit margins than time and materials and fixed price arrangements 
time and materials and fixed price contracts typically generate higher profit margins reflecting their generally higher risk 
where customer requirements are clear  we prefer to enter into time and materials and fixed price arrangements rather than cost plus fee arrangements 
typically under time and materials and fixed price  as compared with cost plus contracts  the customer can save money and we can earn better margins  given the more specific delivery requirements of these structures 

table of contents most of our revenue is generated based on services provided either by our employees or subcontractors 
to a lesser degree  the revenue we earn includes reimbursable travel and other items to support the contractual effort  and may include third party hardware and software that we purchase and integrate for customers as part of the solutions that we provide 
thus  once we win new business  the key to delivering the revenue is through hiring new employees to meet customer requirements  retaining our employees  and ensuring that we deploy them on direct billable jobs 
therefore  we closely monitor hiring success  attrition trends  and direct labor utilization 
a key challenge in growing our business is to hire enough employees with appropriate security clearances 
since we earn higher profits from the labor services that our employees provide compared with subcontracted efforts and other reimbursable items such as hardware and software purchases for customers  we seek to optimize our labor content on the contracts we win 
cost of services includes labor  or the salaries and wages of our employees  plus fringe benefits  the costs of subcontracted labor and outside consultants  third party materials  such as hardware and software that we purchase for customer solutions  and other direct costs such as travel incurred to support contract efforts 
since we earn higher profits on our own labor services  we expect the ratio of cost of services to revenue to decline when our labor services mix increases relative to subcontracted labor or third party material 
conversely  as subcontracted labor or third party material purchases for customers increase relative to our own labor services  we expect the ratio of cost of services to revenue to increase 
as we continue to bid and win larger contracts  our own labor services component could decrease 
this is because the larger contracts typically are broader in scope and require more diverse capabilities resulting in more subcontracted labor with the potential for more third party hardware and software purchases 
in addition  we can face hiring challenges in staffing larger contracts 
while these factors could lead to a higher ratio of cost of services to revenue  the economics of these larger jobs are nonetheless generally favorable because they increase income  broaden our revenue base  and have a favorable return on invested capital 
we have been able to build and effectively use what we refer to as a central services model 
this central services model employs the use of central services for marketing  business development  human resources  recruiting  finance and accounting  infrastructure and other core administrative services 
this central services model allows us to reduce selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue as revenue grows organically and through selective acquisitions  thereby contributing to the growth in operating income 
depreciation and amortization expenses are affected by the level of our annual capital expenditures and the amount of identified intangibles related to acquisitions 
we do not presently foresee significant changes in our capital expenditure requirements  which have been approximately to of revenue over the last three fiscal years 
as we continue to make selected strategic acquisitions  the amortization of identified intangible assets may increase as a percentage of our revenue 
our operating income  or revenue minus cost of services  selling  general and administrative expenses  and depreciation and amortization  and thus our operating margin  or the ratio of operating income to revenue  is driven by the mix and execution on our contracts  how we manage our costs  and the amortization charges resulting from acquisitions 
our cash position is driven primarily by the level of net income  working capital in accounts receivable  capital expenditures and acquisition activities 
selected key metrics evaluated by management we manage and assess the performance of our business by evaluating a variety of metrics 
selected key metrics are discussed below 
revenue growth our revenue growth is primarily organic  but has been augmented by selective strategic acquisitions 
our total revenue growth rate was in fiscal year our organic revenue growth rate was in fiscal 
table of contents year  driven by building out existing accounts  broadening our client base  and leveraging our research and development into high value services 
the table below details our largest contract awards that have contributed to our organic growth client contract period of performance initial contract award value in millions federal deposit insurance corporation technology infrastructure support september september us agency for international development prime enterprise wide it services december january environmental protection agency information technology solutions business information strategic support its biss april april national guard bureau advanced information technology services march september government accountability office it infrastructure support february february a part of our growth strategy includes pursuing acquisitions 
to date  we have made the following acquisitions acquisition strategic value closing date purchase price in millions the marasco newton group  ltd 
environment january  adroit systems  inc command and control  communications  computers  intelligence  surveillance and reconnaissance cisr january  orion scientific systems counterterrorism january  touchstone consulting group  inc strategic consulting april  galaxy scientific corporation command and control  communications  computers  intelligence ci july  spectrum solutions group  inc enterprise resource planning november  mercomms unlimited  inc maritime and defense communications april  contract backlog future growth is dependent upon the strength of our target markets  our ability to identify opportunities  and our ability to successfully bid and win new contracts 
our success can be measured in part based upon the growth of our backlog 
the following table summarizes our contract backlog at the end of the year year ended june  in millions backlog funded unfunded total backlog 
table of contents our total backlog of approximately billion as of june  represented an increase over the fiscal year backlog 
we currently expect to recognize revenue during fiscal year from approximately of our total backlog as of june  contract mix contract profit margins are generally affected by the type of contract 
we can typically earn higher profits on fixed price and time and materials contracts than cost plus fee contracts 
thus  an important part of growing our operating income is to increase the amount of services delivered under fixed price and time and materials contracts 
the following table summarizes our historical contract mix  measured as a percentage of total revenue  for the periods indicated year ended june  cost plus fee time and materials fixed price while our government clients typically determine what type of contract will be awarded to us  where we have the opportunity to influence the type of contract awarded  we will pursue time and materials and fixed price contracts for the reasons discussed above 
headcount and labor utilization because most of our revenue derives from services delivered by our employees  our ability to hire new employees and deploy them on direct billable jobs is critical to our success 
the following table represents our headcount and our direct labor utilization over the past three years year ended june  headcount direct labor utilization operating margin operating margin  or the ratio of operating income to revenue  is affected by the mix of our contracts and how we manage our costs 
our operating margins were   and for the years ended june    and  respectively 
the decrease in operating margin for the year ended june  is primarily due to the compensation expense related to share based payment transactions that we are required to recognize in accordance with sfas no 
r which was adopted on july  additionally  we experienced an increase in third party material purchases which generate lower profit 
days sales outstanding days sales outstanding  or dso  is a measure of how efficiently we manage the billing and collection of our accounts receivable  our most significant working capital requirement 
accounts receivable represents the most significant asset we report on our balance sheet 
we reported dso of and days for the years ended june  and  respectively 
the learning curve associated with the implementation of a new accounting system in july caused dso to increase slightly from fiscal  however  we expect that the system will help us to reduce dso as we go forward 
additionally  we continue to have a number of internal process initiatives underway that we believe will enable us to improve our dso 

table of contents results of operations the following tables set forth some items from our consolidated statements of operations  and these items expressed as a percentage of revenue  for the periods indicated 
year ended june  change change in thousands revenue operating costs and expenses cost of services selling  general  and administrative a b depreciation and amortization total operating costs and expenses operating income interest income  net other income income before taxes provision for income taxes net income as a percentage of revenue revenue operating costs and expenses cost of services selling  general and administrative b depreciation and amortization total operating costs and expenses operating income interest income  net other income income before taxes provision for income taxes net income a year ended june  includes million of stock compensation expense recognized in accordance with the adoption of sfas no 
r on july  b excluding the sfas no r expense  selling  general and administrative expense would have been of revenue in fiscal  an increase of from fiscal revenue our revenue increased to billion in fiscal  from million in fiscal organic revenue growth was for the year  with the remainder of growth mostly attributable to our april and july acquisitions of touchstone and galaxy  respectively 
our organic growth has been driven in part by three large contracts  representing approximately  or approximately half  of our fiscal organic growth 
our federal deposit insurance corporation  or fdic  contract  our advanced information technology services  or aits  contract with the national guard  and our united states agency for international development  or usaid  contract were significant drivers of our revenue growth  generating approximately million of additional revenue during fiscal compared to fiscal 
table of contents our revenue increased to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal organic revenue growth was for the year  with the remainder of growth attributable to our acquisitions of orion and touchstone 
our usaid contract  pentagon wedge subcontract with general dynamics  aits contract with the national guard  and our fdic contract were significant drivers of our fiscal revenue growth  generating approximately million in additional revenue during fiscal compared to fiscal cost of services cost of services increased to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal this increase in cost of services was due primarily to the increased volume of services provided under our fdic  aits  and usaid contracts  and the volume of services attributable to touchstone s and galaxy s contracts 
as a percentage of revenue  cost of services increased to in fiscal  from in fiscal this increase as a percentage of revenue was attributable primarily to an increased amount of direct material purchases made by us and delivered to clients in connection with our services 
typically  direct material purchases generate lower profit  which increases the ratio of cost of services to revenue 
while this higher direct material content can drive our operating margin down  it should have a positive impact on our earnings and return on invested capital 
cost of services increased to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal this increase in cost of services was due primarily to the volume of services provided under the usaid  pentagon wedge  aits  and fdic contracts  and the increased cost of services attributable to orion s and touchstone s existing contracts 
as a percentage of revenue  cost of services increased to in fiscal  from in fiscal this increase as a percentage of revenue was attributable primarily to an increased amount of direct material purchases made by us and delivered to certain larger clients in connection with our services 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal as a percentage of revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to in fiscal from in fiscal this increase as a percentage of revenue resulted primarily from the adoption of sfas no 
r on july  under sfas no 
r  share based payments not fully vested as of july  and those granted in the year ended june  and future periods will be measured at estimated fair value and included in selling  general and administrative expenses over the appropriate earning period 
we recognized approximately million of compensation costs in accordance with sfas no 
r in fiscal excluding the impact of sfas no 
r  selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue was and for the years ended june  and  respectively 
this increase as a percentage of revenue resulted primarily from the double effect of increased costs associated with bid and proposal efforts and lower revenue due to the related transition of professional staff off of billable engagements to support the higher proposal activity 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal as a percentage of revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal this decrease as a percentage of revenue resulted primarily from continued cost control measures taken by management to hold increases in these expenses to a rate below our revenue growth rate 
we have been able to accomplish this by leveraging our central services model as we have won new contracts and integrated acquired companies into our systems and processes 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal this increase in depreciation and amortization resulted primarily from the amortization associated with the identified intangibles recorded as a result of our acquisitions of galaxy and spectrum 
as a percentage of revenue  depreciation and amortization was in both fiscal and 
table of contents depreciation and amortization increased to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal this increase in depreciation and amortization resulted primarily from the amortization associated with the identified intangibles recorded as a result of our acquisitions of orion and touchstone 
as a percentage of revenue  depreciation and amortization decreased to in fiscal  from in fiscal interest income  net interest income  net increased to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal this increase was due to a general rise in interest rates and one time benefits from the interest earned on amended tax return refunds from previous years 
interest income  net increased to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal this increase reflected higher average cash and cash equivalents and investment balances and a general rise in interest rates 
income taxes in fiscal  our effective income tax rate increased to  from in fiscal year the increase was due primarily to additional services performed in higher taxing jurisdictions 
the estimated effective tax rate is based on current tax law and current income and expense projections 
the effective tax rate may be affected by future acquisitions  by changes in interest income from tax advantaged municipal bond investments  or by the receipt of certain tax credits or refunds 
in fiscal  our effective income tax rate decreased to  from in fiscal this decrease was due to one time benefits from virginia job creation tax credits from previous years and refund claims from prior federal and state income tax returns 
seasonality our quarterly operating margins are affected by  among other things  seasonality in our business model 
we may experience a sequential decline in operating margins between our quarter ending june and our quarter ending september in the quarter ending september  we generally experience lower staff utilization rates 
these lower utilization rates are attributable both to summer vacations and to increased proposal activity in connection with the end of the federal fiscal year 
we typically transition a significant number of professional staff temporarily off of billable engagements to support this increased proposal activity 
in addition  we tend to adopt budgets for selling  general and administrative expenses at the beginning of our fiscal year and allocate them roughly flat across the quarters 
our fourth quarter  which ends in june  is typically the strongest quarter as we benefit from the cumulative effect of hires during the year  growing revenue  and declining corporate selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue 
liquidity and capital resources our primary liquidity needs are to finance the costs of operations pending the billing and collection of accounts receivable  to acquire capital assets  to invest in research and development  and to make selective strategic acquisitions 
in june  we completed a follow on offering that resulted in net proceeds to us of approximately million 
as of june   our total cash and investments balances were million 
we used a total of approximately million of cash to purchase galaxy scientific corporation and spectrum solutions group  inc in fiscal year since our may initial public offering  we have been able to meet all of our liquidity requirements  including the completion of seven acquisitions  with cash generated from our operations 
we expect the combination of cash flows from operations  our cash and cash equivalents  and our investments to meet our normal operating liquidity and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  in the event of a large acquisition or a series of smaller acquisitions in a relatively short period of time  we will likely be required to enter into a credit facility or other financing arrangement 

table of contents cash flow accounts receivable represent our largest working capital requirement 
we bill most of our clients monthly after services are rendered 
our operating cash flow is primarily affected by the overall profitability of our contracts  our ability to invoice and collect from our clients in a timely manner  and our ability to manage our vendor payments 
we continue to improve our invoicing and collections procedures to maximize cash flows from operations 
fiscal compared to fiscal net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal  or and times net income for fiscal and  respectively 
the ratio of cash provided by operating activities to net income in fiscal was positively affected by the increase in our accounts payable and accrued expenses balance 
account payable and accrued expenses increased due to the timing of certain vendor payments 
net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was also affected by the adoption of sfas no 
r  which resulted in the reclassification of excess tax benefits from operating cash flows to financing cash flows 
we used million in net cash for investing activities in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal three factors drive our investing cash outflows capital expenditures  the purchase  sale or maturity of investments with maturities that exceed days  and acquisitions 
the higher amount of cash used was primarily the result of our acquisitions of galaxy and spectrum in july and november  respectively 
we spent approximately million more on acquisitions in fiscal than fiscal net cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal on a periodic basis  our employees exercise stock options which results in the issuance of common stock 
the higher amount of cash provided by financing activities in fiscal was primarily the result of our adoption of sfas no 
r in july under sfas no 
r  excess tax benefits from share based payments are presented as sources of financing activity cash flows 
fiscal compared to fiscal net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal  or times net income for both periods 
the ratio of cash provided by operating activities to net income in fiscal was positively affected by million of additional tax benefits of stock option exercises offset by higher net working capital requirements compared to fiscal we used million in net cash for investing activities in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal the lower amount of cash used for investing activities in fiscal was primarily attributable to lower net purchases of investments with maturities in excess of days offset by higher capital expenditure requirements 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal on a periodic basis  our employees exercise stock options resulting in the issuance of common stock 
credit facility and borrowing capacity we elected not to renew a million credit facility when it expired on february  we do not currently intend to replace the credit facility as we expect our cash and cash equivalents and investments  together with cash flow generated from operations  to meet our normal operating liquidity and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
based on our profitability and the cash flow generated from our operating activities  we believe we have significant borrowing capacity 
we maintain relationships with a number of banks who have communicated a willingness to extend credit to us on reasonable terms if the need for credit arises 
in particular  it is likely that we would be required to borrow in the event of a large acquisition or a series of smaller acquisitions in a relatively short period of time 

table of contents stock purchase agreement on august   we and our chairman of the board of directors terminated a stock purchase agreement that required us to repurchase shares from the chairman s estate upon his death 
we had purchased term life insurance policies on our chairman to meet these repurchase obligations 
we have terminated all related term life insurance policies 
expenses recognized under these policies were  and  for the years ended june  and  respectively 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of june  that require us to make future cash payments 
for contractual obligations  we included payments that we have an unconditional obligation to make 
we did not include amounts already recorded on our balance sheet as liabilities at june  payments due by period less than years years after contractual obligations total year and and years in thousands operating lease obligations  net total contractual obligations in the normal course of our business  we enter into agreements with subcontractors and vendors to provide products and services that we consume in our operations or that are delivered to our customers 
these products and services are not considered unconditional obligations until the products and services are actually delivered  at which time we record a liability for our obligation 
related party transactions in may  mantas  which was previously one of our service offerings  was contributed to a separate company  mantas  inc  or mantas  which was formed with funding and other contributions received from unrelated third parties 
mantas is a provider of services to the financial services industry to address anti money laundering and other data mining issues 
as of june   we owned approximately eight million shares of mantas class a common stock 
we have no cost basis in this investment and do not fund  nor is there any obligation or expectation to fund  the on going operations of mantas 
in the years ended june  and  mantas leased space and received other services from the company for which the company was reimbursed 
the company is no longer providing services to mantas 
description of critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition  doubtful accounts receivable  goodwill and other intangible assets  and other contingent liabilities 
we base our estimates on our historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable at the time the estimates are made 
actual results may differ significantly from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the critical accounting policies requiring us to make significant estimates and judgments are revenue recognition  contract cost accounting  and accounting for acquisitions  including the identification of intangible assets and the 
table of contents ongoing impairment assessments of the intangible assets 
if any of these estimates or judgments proves to be incorrect  our reported results could be materially affected 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  services have been rendered or goods delivered  the contract price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we have a standard management process that we use to determine whether all required criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
this standard management process includes a regular review of our contract performance 
this review covers  among other matters  outstanding action items  progress against schedule  effort and staffing  requirements stability  quality  risks and issues  subcontract management  cost  commitments  and client satisfaction 
during this review we determine whether the overall progress on a contract is consistent with the effort expended 
absent evidence to the contrary  we recognize revenue as follows 
revenue on cost plus fee contracts is recognized to the extent of costs actually incurred plus a proportionate amount of the fee earned 
we consider fixed fees under cost plus fee contracts to be earned in proportion to the allowable costs actually incurred in performance of the contract 
revenue on time and materials contracts is recognized based on the hours actually incurred at the negotiated contract billing rates  plus the cost of any allowable material costs and out of pocket expenses 
revenue on fixed price contracts is generally recognized using the percentage of completion method of contract accounting 
unless it is determined as part of our regular contract performance review that overall progress on a contract is not consistent with costs expended to date  we determine the percentage completed based on the percentage of costs incurred to date in relation to total estimated costs expected upon completion of the contract 
revenue on fixed price contracts pursuant to which a client pays us a specified amount to provide only a particular service for a stated time period  a so called fee for service arrangement  is generally recognized ratably over the contract period  assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition are met 
we consider performance based fees  including award fees  under any contract type to be earned when we can demonstrate satisfaction of performance goals  based upon historical experience  or we receive contractual notification from a client that the fee has been earned 
billings for hardware or software purchased by customers under one of our contracts where we act as an agent  rather than a principal  in the transaction are excluded from our revenue and cost of services  except to the extent of any fee or profit earned 
contract revenue recognition inherently involves estimation 
examples of estimates include the contemplated level of effort to accomplish the tasks under contract  the cost of the effort  and an ongoing assessment of our progress toward completing the contract 
from time to time  as part of our standard management processes  facts develop that require us to revise our estimated total costs or revenue 
to the extent that a revised estimate affects contract profit or revenue previously recognized  we record the cumulative effect of the revision in the period in which the facts requiring the revision become known 
the full amount of an anticipated loss on any type of contract is recognized in the period in which it becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated 
from time to time  we may proceed with work based on client direction prior to the completion and signing of formal contract documents 
we have a formal review process for approving any such work 
revenue associated with such work is recognized only when it can be reliably estimated and realization is probable 
we base our estimates on previous experiences with the client  communications with the client regarding funding status  and our knowledge of available funding for the contract or program 

table of contents we maintain reserves for doubtful accounts receivable that may arise in the normal course of business 
historically  we have not had significant write offs of doubtful accounts receivable related to work we perform for the federal government 
however  we do perform work on contracts and task orders where  on occasion  issues arise that lead to accounts receivable not being fully collected 
contract cost accounting as a contractor providing services primarily to the federal government  we must categorize our costs as either direct or indirect and allowable or unallowable 
direct costs are those costs that are identified with specific contracts 
these costs include labor  subcontractor and consultant services  third party materials we purchase under a contract  and other non labor costs incurred in support of a contract 
indirect costs are those costs not identified with specific contracts 
rather  indirect costs are allocated to contracts in accordance with federal government rules and regulations 
these costs typically include our selling  general and administrative expenses  fringe benefit expenses  and depreciation and amortization costs 
direct and indirect costs that are not allowable under the federal acquisition regulation or specific contract provisions cannot be considered for reimbursement under our federal government contracts 
we must specifically identify these costs to ensure we comply with these requirements 
our unallowable costs include a portion of our executive compensation  certain employee morale activities  certain types of legal and consulting costs  and the amortization of identified intangible assets  among others 
a key element to our recent margin expansion has been our success at controlling indirect cost growth and unallowable costs 
in addition  as we acquire and integrate new companies  we have been able to manage our indirect costs by realizing opportunities for cost synergies and integrating the indirect support function of acquired companies into our own 
accounting for acquisitions and asset impairment the purchase price that we pay to acquire the stock or assets of an entity must be assigned to the net assets acquired based on the estimated fair market value of those net assets 
the purchase price in excess of the estimated fair market value of the tangible net assets and separately identified intangible assets acquired represents goodwill 
the purchase price allocation related to acquisitions involves significant estimates and management judgments that may be adjusted during the purchase price allocation period  but generally not beyond one year from the acquisition date 
we must evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  or during any interim period if we have an indication that goodwill may be impaired 
we assess the potential impairment of goodwill by comparing the carrying value of the assets and liabilities of our reporting unit to which goodwill is assigned to the estimated fair value of the reporting unit using a discounted cash flow approach 
we performed our annual goodwill impairment analysis as of january  there was no indication of goodwill impairment as a result of our impairment analysis 
if we are required to record an impairment charge in the future  it could materially affect our results of operations 
the estimated fair market value of identified intangible assets is amortized over the estimated useful life of the related intangible asset 
we have a process pursuant to which we typically retain third party valuation experts to assist us in determining the fair market values and useful lives of identified intangible assets 
we evaluate these assets for impairment when events occur that suggest a possible impairment 
such events could include  but are not limited to  the loss of a significant client or contract  decreases in federal government appropriations or funding for specific programs or contracts  or other similar events 
none of these events have occurred for the periods presented 
we determine impairment by comparing the net book value of the asset to its future undiscounted net cash flows 
if an impairment occurs  we will record an impairment expense equal to the difference between the net book value of the asset and its estimated discounted cash flows using a discount rate based on our cost of capital and the related risks of recoverability 

table of contents description of statement of operations items the following is a description of certain line items of our statements of operations 
revenue most of our revenue is generated on the basis of services provided to the federal government  either by our employees or by our subcontractors 
to a lesser degree  the revenue we earn may include third party hardware and software that we purchase and integrate when requested by the client as a part of the solutions that we provide to our clients 
contract types 
when contracting with our government clients  we enter into one of three basic types of contracts cost plus fee  time and materials  and fixed price 
cost plus fee contracts 
cost plus fee contracts provide for reimbursement of allowable costs and the payment of a fee  which is our profit 
cost plus fixed fee contracts specify the contract fee in dollars 
cost plus award fee contracts may provide for a base fee amount  plus an award fee that varies  within specified limits  based upon the client s assessment of our performance as compared to contractual targets for factors such as cost  quality  schedule  and performance 
time and materials contracts 
under a time and materials contract  we are paid a fixed hourly rate for each direct labor hour expended and we are reimbursed for allowable material costs and out of pocket expenses 
to the extent our actual direct labor and associated costs vary in relation to the fixed hourly billing rates provided in the contract  we will generate more or less profit  or could incur a loss 
fixed price contracts 
under a fixed price contract  we agree to perform the specified work for a pre determined price 
to the extent our actual costs vary from the estimates upon which the price was negotiated  we will generate more or less than the anticipated amount of profit or could incur a loss 
some fixed price contracts have a performance based component  pursuant to which we can earn incentive payments or incur financial penalties based on our performance 
cost of services cost of services includes the direct costs to provide our services and business solutions to clients 
the most significant of these costs are the salaries and wages  plus associated fringe benefits  of our employees directly serving clients 
cost of services also includes the costs of subcontractors and outside consultants  third party materials  such as hardware or software that we purchase and provide to the client as part of an integrated solution  and any other direct costs  such as travel expenses incurred to support contract efforts 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses include the salaries and wages  plus associated fringe benefits  of our employees not performing work directly for clients 
among the functions covered by these costs are asset and facilities management  business development  research and development  contracts and legal  finance and accounting  executive and senior management  human resources  and information system support 
facilities related costs are also included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization includes depreciation of computers and other equipment  the amortization of software we use internally  the amortization of leasehold improvements  and the amortization of identified intangible assets 
the amortization of computer software developed for sale to clients is included in cost of services 
other income the internal revenue service  or irs  challenged our use of the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting for income taxes during its audit of our fiscal tax return 
while we disagreed with the irs on 
table of contents this matter  in order to bring the matter to closure  we agreed in february to convert from the cash method to the accrual method effective july  we had previously established an allowance of approximately million relating to the estimated probable interest on the tax liability 
the provision for this accrual was reflected in other expense in the statements of operations through june  because this allowance exceeded the amount of the actual federal interest payments of approximately  and our estimated state interest payments of approximately  we reversed approximately million of the allowance in fiscal year during fiscal  we made final payments to settle all remaining state tax liabilities with respect to this matter 
as a result  we reversed the remaining  allowance balance 
these reversals are reflected as other income in the statements of operations for fiscal year and fiscal year definition of certain terms used in this management s discussion and analysis the following is our definition of certain terms we have used in our discussion and analysis 
backlog we define backlog to include funded and unfunded orders for services under existing signed contracts  assuming the exercise of all options relating to those contracts  less the amount of revenue we have previously recognized under those contracts 
backlog includes all contract options that have been priced but not yet funded 
backlog also includes the contract value under single award id iq contracts against which we expect future task orders to be issued without competition 
backlog does not take contract ceiling value into consideration under multiple award contracts  nor does it include any estimate of future potential delivery orders that might be awarded under multiple award id iq vehicles  gwac contracts  or gsa schedules 
we define funded backlog to be the portion of backlog for which funding currently is appropriated and obligated to us under a contract or other authorization for payment signed by an authorized purchasing authority 
our backlog includes orders under contracts that in some cases extend for several years  with the latest expiring during calendar year we cannot guarantee that we will recognize any revenue from our backlog 
the federal government has the prerogative to cancel any contract or delivery order at any time 
most of our contracts and delivery orders have cancellation terms that would permit us to recover all or a portion of our incurred costs and potential fees in such cases 
backlog varies considerably from time to time as current contracts or delivery orders are executed and new contracts or delivery orders under existing contracts are won 
days sales outstanding we calculate days sales outstanding  or dso  by dividing the average accounts receivable at the beginning and end of the period  net of average billings in excess of revenue  by revenue per day in the period

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial instruments that potentially subject us to credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents  short and long term investments  and accounts receivable 
we believe that concentrations of credit risk with respect to cash equivalents and investments are limited due to the high credit quality of these investments 
our investment policy requires that investments be in direct obligations of the us government  certain us government sponsored entities  investments that are secured by direct or sponsored us government obligations  or certain corporate or municipal debt obligations rated at least single a or a p  as applicable  by both moody s investor service and standard and poor s 
our policy does not allow investment in any equity securities or the obligations of any entity under review for possible downgrade by a major rating service to a debt rating below single a 
investments in both fixed and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed securities may have their fair market value adversely affected because of a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations because of changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have seen a decline in market value because of changes in interest rates 
investments are made in accordance with an investment policy approved by our board of directors 

table of contents under this policy  no investment securities may have maturities exceeding two years and the average duration of the portfolio cannot exceed nine months 
a one percentage point change in the interest rate we earn between july  and december   could have approximately a million impact on our interest income for the period ending june  we believe that concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited as they are primarily federal government receivables 
as of june  and  the carrying value of financial instruments approximated fair value 
these investments consist of corporate and municipal bonds with maturities of months or less that are classified as held to maturity
