item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition should be read together with the other financial information and consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of a variety of factors  including those discussed in risk factors and elsewhere in this form k 
change in method of accounting during the first quarter of  our industrial group changed its method of accounting for certain inventory and cost of sales at our louisville manufacturing facility to the first in  first out fifo method from the last in  first out lifo method used in all prior years 
as a result  all inventories are now stated at the lower of cost  determined on a fifo basis  or market 
prior to this voluntary change in accounting principle  approximately of our total inventory as previously reported was valued using lifo and the remaining inventories were valued using fifo 
the change is preferable because it results in conforming all of our inventories to a uniform method of accounting subsequent to a series of acquisitions from through in addition  inventories will be valued in a manner which more closely approximates current cost  and fifo is the prevalent method used by other entities within our industry and provides a more meaningful and understandable presentation of financial position to users of our consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting changes  the consolidated financial statements for all prior periods have been adjusted to retroactively apply this change in accounting principle 
for the year ended december   the change from lifo to fifo reduced previously reported cost of sales for our industrial group by million which resulted in corresponding increases in gross profit  operating income and income before taxes

overview we are a diversified provider of outsourced services and specialty products 
we perform a wide range of manufacturing  engineering  design  testing and other technical services  typically under multi year  sole source contracts with major companies and government agencies in the markets for aerospace defense electronics  truck components assemblies  and test measurement services 
revenue from our three core markets accounted for approximately of our revenue for the year ended december   while revenue from our outsourced services accounted for approximately of our revenue 
we expect these percentages to increase in the future 
the company is organized into two business groups  the industrial group and the electronics group 
the industrial group is one reportable business segment  while the electronics group includes two reportable business segments  aerospace defense and test measurement 
the industrial group is comprised of sypris technologies  inc and its subsidiaries  which generates revenue primarily from the sale of manufacturing services to customers in the market for truck components assemblies and from the sale of products to the energy and chemical markets 
the aerospace defense reportable segment is comprised of sypris data systems  inc and sypris electronics  llc 
revenue from this group is derived primarily from the sale of manufacturing services  technical services and products to customers in the market for aerospace defense electronics 
the test measurement reportable segment consists solely of sypris test measurement  inc  which generates revenue primarily from providing technical services for the calibration  certification and repair of test and measurement equipment in the us our objective is to become the leading outsourcing specialist in each of our core markets for aerospace defense electronics  truck components assemblies  and test measurement services 
we have focused our efforts on establishing long term relationships with industry leaders who embrace multi year contractual relationships as a strategic component of their supply chain management 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported 
changes in facts and circumstances could have a significant impact on the resulting estimated amounts included in our consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more complex judgments and estimates 
we also have other policies that we consider to be key accounting policies  such as our policies for revenue recognition in the industrial group  including cost of sales  however  these policies do not meet the definition of critical accounting estimates because they do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 

table of contents long term contract net revenue 
a large part of our aerospace defense segment business is derived from long term contracts for development  production and service activities which we account for consistent with the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa audit and accounting guide  audits of federal government contractors  the aicpa s statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  and other relevant revenue recognition accounting literature  as applicable 
we consider the nature of these contracts and the types of products and services provided when we determine the proper accounting for a particular contract 
primarily  we record long term  fixed price contracts on a percentage of completion basis using units of delivery to measure progress toward completing the contract and recognizing net revenue 
revenue is recognized on these contracts when units are shipped or delivered to the customer  as applicable  with unit revenue based upon unit prices as set forth in the applicable contracts 
the costs attributed to contract revenue are based upon the estimated average costs of all units to be shipped 
for example  we use this method of revenue recognition on our encryption programs 
in less frequent circumstances  we enter into milestone specific  fixed price contracts for which net revenue is recorded when we achieve performance milestones 
revenue recognized under such milestones is limited to net revenue that we would recognize under the cost to cost method 
under the cost to cost method of accounting  revenue is recognized based on the ratio of costs incurred to our estimate of total costs at completion 
for example  we use this methodology for our cec  common card and ki programs 
as we incur costs under cost reimbursement type contracts  we record net revenue 
cost reimbursement type contracts include time and materials and other level of effort type contracts 
an example of this type of revenue recognition includes the jwarn program 
as a general rule  we recognize net revenue and profits earlier in a production cycle when we use the cost to cost and milestone methods of percentage of completion accounting than when we use the units of delivery method 
in addition  our profits and margins may vary materially depending on the types of long term government contracts undertaken  the costs incurred in their performance  the achievement of other performance objectives  and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees is finally determined 
contract accounting requires judgment relative to assessing risks  estimating contract revenues and costs  and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues 
due to the size and nature of many of our contracts  the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables 
contract costs include material  labor and subcontracting costs  as well as an allocation of indirect costs 
assumptions have to be made regarding the length of time to complete the contract because costs also include expected increases in wages and prices for materials 
for contract change orders  claims or similar items  we apply judgment in estimating the amounts and assessing the potential for realization 
these amounts are only included in contract value when they can be reliably estimated and realization is considered probable 
the majority of our aerospace defense segment net revenue is driven by pricing based on costs incurred to produce products or perform services under contracts with the us government  and therefore not necessarily on market based factors 
cost based pricing is determined under the federal acquisition regulations far 
the far provides guidance on the types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services under us government contracts 
for example  costs such as those related to charitable contributions  advertising  interest expense  and public relations are unallowable  and therefore not recoverable through net revenue 
approximately  and of total net revenue was recognized under the percentage of completion method based on units of delivery during  and  respectively 
approximately  and of total net revenue was recognized under the percentage of completion method based on milestones or cost to cost during  and  respectively 
therefore  the amounts we record in our consolidated financial statements using contract accounting methods and cost accounting standards are material 
because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes  it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change 
when adjustments in estimated contract revenues or costs are required  any changes from prior estimates are generally included in earnings in the current period 
we closely monitor compliance with and the consistent application of our critical accounting policies related to contract accounting 
in addition to less formal monthly reviews  management in the aerospace defense segment formally assess the status of contracts on a quarterly basis through extensive estimate at completion reviews which include multiple levels of program personnel 
costs incurred and allocated to contracts with the us 
table of contents government are reviewed for compliance with regulatory standards by our personnel  and are subject to audit by the defense contract audit agency 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we establish reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable based on overall receivable aging levels  a specific evaluation of accounts for customers with known financial difficulties and evaluation of customer chargebacks  if any 
these reserves and corresponding write offs could significantly increase if our customers experience deteriorating financial results or in the event we receive a significant chargeback which is deemed uncollectible 
impairments 
goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment by calculating the estimated fair value of each business with which goodwill is associated 
the estimated fair value is based on a discounted cash flow analysis that requires judgment in our evaluation of the business and establishing an appropriate discount rate and terminal value to apply in the calculations 
in selecting these and other assumptions for each business  we consider historical performance  forecasted operating results  general market conditions and industry considerations specific to the business 
it is possible that the assumptions underlying the impairment analysis will change in such a manner that impairment charges may occur 
we likely would compute a materially different fair value for a business if different assumptions were used or if circumstances were to change 
at december   net assets of our test measurement segment were million  including goodwill of million 
our test measurement segment reported an operating loss in of million  primarily as a result of decreased product sales  cost and process inefficiencies on certain technical services provided by this segment and an unfavorable mix of technical service revenue 
a new senior management team was installed in for this segment and spending for sales  marketing  research and development were increased in to grow the revenue base  and various organizational changes were made to improve the operations 
in  such investments yielded increased net revenue and gross margin resulting in million of operating income 
as restructuring efforts continue to pay back  further operating income improvement is expected in if continued improvement in our test measurement operations is not achieved and profitability deteriorates  we may be required to record an impairment charge to goodwill for the test measurement segment 
the recoverability of long lived assets is evaluated if impairment indicators exist 
indicators of impairment include historical financial performance  operating trends and our future operating plans 
if impairment indicators exist  we evaluate the recoverability of long lived assets based on forecasted undiscounted cash flows 
if an impairment has occurred  the long lived asset is written down to its estimated fair value on a discounted basis 
the estimation of future cash flows requires management s judgment concerning historical performance  forecasted operating results  general market conditions and industry considerations specific to the assets 
there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management s judgments in applying these factors to the analysis of long lived asset impairment 
it is possible that the assumptions underlying the impairment analysis will change in such a manner that impairment charges may occur 
we likely would compute a materially different estimate of future cash flows if different assumptions were used or if circumstances were to change 
reserve for excess  obsolete and scrap inventory 
we record inventory at the lower of cost  determined under the first in  first out method  or market 
because of the stability of product costs in recent years  and the level of gross profit margins on most products  we have not made any material adjustments to write down inventory to market 
however  we do reserve for excess  obsolete or scrap inventory 
these reserves are primarily based upon management s assessment of the salability of the inventory  historical usage of raw materials  historical demand for finished goods  and estimated future usage and demand 
an improper assessment of salability or improper estimate of future usage or demand  or significant changes in usage or demand could result in significant changes in the reserves and a positive or a negative impact on our consolidated results of operations in the period the change occurs 
results of operations the tables presented below  which compare our consolidated results of operations from one year to another  present the results for each year  the change in those results from one year to another in both dollars and percentage change and the results for each year as a percentage of net revenue 
the columns present the following the first two data columns in each table show the absolute results for each year presented 

table of contents the columns entitled year over year change and year over year percentage change show the change in results  both in dollars and percentages 
these two columns show favorable changes as positive and unfavorable changes as negative 
for example  when our net revenue increases from one year to the next  that change is shown as a positive number in both columns 
conversely  when expenses increase from one year to the next  that change is shown as a negative number in both columns 
the last two columns in each table show the results for each period as a percentage of net revenue

table of contents backlog 
our backlog increased million to million at december   on million in net orders in compared to million in we expect to convert approximately of the backlog at december  to revenue during backlog for our industrial group increased million to million at december   on million in net orders in compared to million in we expect to convert substantially all of the industrial group s backlog at december  to revenue during backlog for our aerospace defense segment decreased million to million at december   on million in net orders in compared to million in backlog for our test measurement segment decreased million to million at december  on million in net orders in compared to million in we expect to convert approximately of the aerospace defense backlog and approximately of the test measurement backlog at december  to revenue during net revenue 
net revenue in the industrial group for the year increased due to higher volume resulting from the new arvinmeritor and dana contracts that started in may and june of  respectively 
these new contracts with arvinmeritor for trailer axle beams and various drive train components and with dana for steer axles  drive axle shafts and drive train components for the light  medium and heavy duty truck markets generated outsourced services revenue of million in  as compared to million in excluding the new contracts  the industrial group s net revenue increased million  or  in  primarily due to record demand for medium and heavy duty trucks as a result of pre buy activity ahead of a change in domestic emission requirements 
the aerospace defense segment derives its revenue from manufacturing services  other outsourced services and product sales 
manufacturing services revenue accounted for approximately and of total aerospace defense segment revenue in and  respectively 
manufacturing services revenue increased million in primarily due to increased volume on two military programs and revenue from new customers for initial shipments on new contracts 
net revenue from technical outsourced services decreased million in primarily due to the completion of an engineering program in net revenue from product sales decreased million primarily due to decreased demand for legacy data storage products 
the test measurement segment derives its revenue from technical services and product sales 
technical services revenue accounted for approximately and of total test measurement revenue in and  respectively 
products sales increased million in  primarily due to increased shipments on a military program  while revenue from technical services was consistent with the prior year 
gross profit 
the industrial group s gross profit decreased million in associated with start up programs and capacity constraints in addition to increased energy costs 
gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased to for from in  primarily due to costs associated with the increase in manufacturing capacity  launch of new programs  overtime to meet customer shipment schedules and increased natural gas costs 
we expect lean and other cost reduction initiatives along with reductions in capital expansion in to result in gross profit increases throughout the factors impacting gross profit in the fourth quarter included higher natural gas and overtime along with the impact of declining overhead absorption rates resulting from inventory reduction initiatives 
the aerospace defense segment s gross profit decreased million in primarily due to lower data storage product sales and technical outsourced revenue 
lower overhead absorption attributable to decreased product revenue reduced gross profit by million for technical outsourced services gross profit decreased by from primarily due to lower revenue 
gross margin for the aerospace defense segment was in as compared to in the decrease in gross margin resulted primarily from the lower volume and related margins for product sales  which was partially offset by higher volume for manufacturing services 
the test measurement segment s gross profit increased million in primarily due to the increased product sales combined with lower personnel costs resulting from headcount reductions in the first half of 
table of contents selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense increased million in and decreased as a percentage of net revenue to in from in the industrial group s selling  general and administrative expense accounted for million of the increase  primarily due to higher administrative costs related to additional infrastructure to support the new contracts in the industrial group and the overall growth of the business 
the test measurement segment also increased selling expense to drive increased revenue  which was offset by reductions in selling  general and administrative expense in the aerospace defense segment resulting from reduced headcount 
research and development 
research and development costs decreased million in due to the successful completion and launch of one of our data systems product development projects within our aerospace defense segment in the last half of such costs are expected to decline in as other product development projects are completed 
amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets increased in primarily due to certain identifiable intangible assets acquired in connection with the arvinmeritor and dana contracts that started in may and june of  respectively 
interest expense  net 
interest expense increased in due to an increase in our weighted average debt outstanding and higher interest rates 
our weighted average debt outstanding increased to million during from million during the increase in debt primarily related to the industrial group s acquisitions and capital expenditures to increase capacity and automation 
the weighted average interest rate increased to in from in our effective interest rate is expected to increase in due to expected increased market rates under our credit agreement  however  interest costs are expected to decline in due to a continuation of working capital reduction initiatives which reduced net debt by million in the second half of other income  net 
other income  net increased million in due primarily to foreign currency remeasurement gains of us dollar denominated accounts of our foreign subsidiaries 
income taxes 
our effective income tax rate was in as compared to for the decrease primarily relates to the full year impact of our mexico operations acquired on june   for which the statutory tax rate is

table of contents customers in connection with the new contracts 
these contracts included two with dana for steer axle components  drive axle shafts and various drive train components for the light  medium and heavy duty truck markets and one with arvinmeritor for trailer axle beams and various drive train components 
the new contracts generated outsourced services revenue of million in excluding the new contracts  the industrial group s net revenue increased million for the year primarily due to a general increase in demand for medium and heavy duty trucks 
net revenue in the aerospace defense segment decreased million in primarily due to lower revenue from manufacturing services 
manufacturing services decreased million primarily due to reduced program funding for federal government agencies  delayed shipments and contracts completed during other outsourced services revenue and product sales decreased million and million in respectively 
the decrease in product sales is primarily due to reduced government funding for our customer s programs 
net revenue in the test measurement segment increased million in primarily due to a million increase in technical sales 
the increase in revenue from technical services is primarily due to a large contract with a prime government contractor for testing services performed during  growth from calibration services provided under certain customer accounts in and the full year impact of two calibration operations acquired during the second half of gross profit 
the industrial group s gross profit increased million in primarily due to the revenue growth from new contracts 
gross profit contributed by the new contracts was partially offset by manufacturing inefficiencies associated with disruptions in raw material and key components and capacity limitations associated with the increased demand 
the disruptions to production schedules related to the timely and dependable receipt of steel and components were present throughout  however  during the fourth quarter the industrial group s gross margin declined to and resulted in full year gross margin of as compared to in the factors impacting gross profit in the fourth quarter included excessive overtime to meet fluctuating customer demand  loss of days worked to conduct three physical inventories  cost overruns on a variety of new manufacturing cells  higher than expected training costs on new programs and increased charges to reflect the growing nature and complexity of the business 
labor and absorption variances of approximately million related to manufacturing inefficiencies were recognized and excess supply  tooling and freight costs totaling approximately million were incurred in the fourth quarter 
also  an inventory adjustment of million was recorded in the fourth quarter primarily due to production scrap 
our aerospace defense segment s gross profit decreased million in primarily due to lower margins associated with the decrease in product revenue 
product revenue declined for the year which resulted in a corresponding decrease in gross profit of million 
the decline is primarily volume related  although competitive pricing pressure also began to impact profit margins during the second half of manufacturing and other outsourced services gross profit decreased million or in  primarily due to a revenue decrease of and an inventory write off of million in the fourth quarter related to a terminated contract 
gross margin for the aerospace and defense segment was in as compared to in the decrease in gross margin resulted primarily from the lower volume and related margins for product sales and the lower volume for manufacturing services

table of contents liquidity  capital resources and financial condition net cash provided by operating activities was million in as compared to net cash used in operating activities of million in the cash provided by operating activities in includes a net decrease in working capital investment primarily due to an increase in accounts payable of million and a decrease in inventories and accounts receivable of million and million  respectively 
the reduction in working capital in was primarily driven by the implementation of a weekly working capital management framework in the second half of the use of cash in operating activities in was primarily due to a net increase in working capital investment related to our new arvinmeritor and dana contracts that started in may and june of  respectively 
net cash used in investing activities was million in as compared to million in capital expenditures decreased to million in from million in capital expenditures in for our industrial group were million principally comprised of forging  machining  and centralized tooling equipment  while capital expenditures for our aerospace defense and test measurement segments were million and million  respectively  principally comprised of manufacturing  assembly and test equipment 
capital expenditures in for the industrial group were million with an additional million invested in for the acquisition of net assets related to the new contracts with dana and arvinmeritor 
capital expenditures in for our aerospace defense and test measurement segments were million and million  respectively 
the reduction of capital expenditures in the industrial group for is the result of our expected gradual return to normal levels of capital expenditures  after our initial investments in new plants  forging technology and automation 
capital expenditures decreased in for the aerospace defense segment as several programs neared completion and new programs required less new capital investment than in prior years 
net cash used in financing activities was million in as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million in in  we made net repayments totaling million on our revolving credit facility as a result of significantly improved cash flow from operations 
in  we received net proceeds of million from our public stock offering of  shares of common stock that closed in march and april we also issued senior notes for a total of million in june and august through private placement transitions 
proceeds from the offering were principally used to reduce debt on our revolving credit facility 
we had total availability for borrowings and letters of credit under the revolving credit facility of million at december  maximum borrowings on the revolving credit facility are million  subject to a million limit for letters of credit 
on february   the company exercised its option to voluntarily reduce the aggregate commitment to  the voluntary election reduced the total availability for borrowings and letters of credit under the revolving credit facility to million  which when combined with our unrestricted cash balance of million  provides for total cash and borrowing capacity of million 
the credit agreement includes an option to increase the amount of available credit to million  subject to the lead bank s approval 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility may be used to finance working capital requirements  acquisitions and for general corporate purposes  including capital expenditures 
most acquisitions require the approval of our bank group 
our credit agreement was amended in march to revise certain financial covenants  while our senior notes were amended in august to revise certain financial covenants 
other terms of the credit agreement and senior notes remained substantially unchanged 
on march  the filing date  our largest customer  dana  and of its us subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under chapter of the us bankruptcy code in the us bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york 
dana s european  south american  asia pacific  canadian and mexican subsidiaries dana mexico were excluded from the chapter filing and are operating as normal 
as of the filing date  we had been paid for substantially all outstanding dana accounts receivable recorded in the balance sheet at december  accounts receivable from domestic dana subsidiaries at the filing date could be subject to compromise  right of offset or set aside as a protected payment under dana s chapter filing 
for example  recently amended bankruptcy law generally permits accounts payable to be offset against accounts receivable and offers protection for the last calendar days of shipments as an administrative priority expense in the bankruptcy 
as of the filing date and excluding certain gain contingencies  we estimated amounts due from dana to approximate million including up to an estimated million due from dana mexico  in addition to potential offsets 
table of contents from accounts payable and other protected claims of million  although right of offset and protected claims have not been approved by the bankruptcy court 
we continue to pursue additional offsets to further reduce our net receivable position 
under the chapter proceedings  right of offset may not be granted  certain payments made by dana to the company in the days preceding dana s chapter filing could be subject to return as a preference  or our shipments may not be protected  which would increase our net receivable position 
as a consequence of dana s chapter filing  the timing of payments from dana will increase our net debt and working capital levels 
accounts receivable and payable from dana mexico are not currently subject to compromise under dana s chapter filing and continue to be received and paid in normal course 
our principal commitments at december  consisted of repayments of borrowings under the credit agreement and senior notes  pension obligations and obligations under operating leases for certain of our real property and equipment 
estimated pension contributions for are expected to range from million to million 
we also had purchase commitments totaling approximately million at december   primarily for inventory and manufacturing equipment 
the following table provides information about the payment dates of our debt and contractual lease obligations at december   excluding current liabilities except for the current portion of long term debt amounts in thousands thereafter revolving credit facility senior notes operating leases total at december  we also had approximately million of federal net operating loss carryforwards available to offset future federal taxable income 
such carryforwards will increase future cash flows  if utilized  and reflect income tax losses incurred which will expire on december  we believe that sufficient resources will be available to satisfy our cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
cash requirements for periods beyond the next twelve months depend on our profitability  our ability to manage working capital requirements and our rate of growth 
if we make significant acquisitions  if our largest customers experience financial difficulty  or if working capital and capital expenditure requirements exceed expected levels during the next twelve months or in subsequent periods  we may require additional external sources of capital 
there can be no assurance that any additional required financing will be available through bank borrowings  debt or equity financings or otherwise  or that if such financing is available  it will be available on terms acceptable to us 
if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms  our business  consolidated results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected

 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas no 
r is similar to the approach described in sfas no 
sfas no 
r requires that all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an option 
the provisions of statement no 
r are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  as permitted by sfas no 
 we historically accounted for stock option grants in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and  as the strike price of options issued was equal to grant date fair value  we did not recognize compensation cost for employee stock option issuances 
we adopted sfas no 
r on january  using the modified prospective method 
excluding restricted stock issued in  the impact of adoption of sfas r is expected to result in an additional non cash compensation expense in fiscal for options granted through december  of million  net of tax  plus an undetermined amount for options yet to be granted 
had the company adopted sfas no 

table of contents r in prior periods  the impact would have approximated the impact of sfas no 
pro forma footnote disclosure  excluding the impact of the underwater option accelerations which occurred in on march   april  and december   the board of directors approved resolutions to accelerate the vesting for underwater options as of march   april  and december   respectively in order to reduce future compensation expense related to outstanding options 
after amendment of each underlying option agreement  compensation expense to be recognized in the income statement  subsequent to the adoption of sfas no 
r was reduced by approximately million  net of tax 
sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while the company cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amount of operating cash flows recognized for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively
