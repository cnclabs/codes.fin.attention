the increase was also due to higher appalachia ngl product sales prices and volumes  which increased revenues by million 
in addition  higher margins due to higher gas prices in the southwest  along with increased southwest processing margins from an increase in liquid prices  contributed million 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in the partnership s michigan pipeline throughput volumes  which decreased revenue by million 
purchased product costs

in addition  the allocation of compensation expense to the partnership resulting from the sale of the subordinated partnership units and interests in the partnership s general partner to certain of markwest hydrocarbon s employees and directors from through increased selling  general and administrative expenses by million 
the charge did not affect management s determination of the partnership s distributable cash flow for any period  and did not affect net income attributed to the limited partners 
depreciation 
depreciation expense increased during primarily due to the partnership s and acquisitions  which increased depreciation by approximately million 
additionally  commencing january   the partnership accelerated the rate of depreciation of its michigan gathering pipeline and processing plant by reducing the estimated useful lives of the related assets from years to years to more closely match expected lives of contractually dedicated reserves behind the partnership s facilities 
amortization of intangible assets 
amortization expense increased during primarily due to the east texas system acquisition in july on july   the partnership completed the acquisition of american central eastern texas carthage gathering system and gas processing assets located in east texas for approximately million 
of the total purchase price  million was allocated to customer contracts  of which million was amortized during impairments 
during the fourth quarter of  the partnership recorded a write off of million of costs associated with an isomerization unit taken out of service 
during the fourth quarter of  the partnership s general partner s board of directors approved a plan to replace the partnership s existing cobb extraction facility with a new facility 
consequently  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the partnership wrote down the carrying value of the current cobb facility by million to its estimated fair value 
other income and expenses interest expense 
interest expense increased million  or  during relative to primarily due to increased debt levels resulting from the partnership s financing of its and acquisitions 
a significant amount of the partnership s acquisitions were financed through additional borrowings under its credit facility and the issuance of its senior notes 
amortization of deferred financing costs

during  we amortized approximately million of deferred financing costs related to debt issuance costs incurred to finance the partnership s acquisitions  of which million represented accelerated amortization due to the refinancing of the partnership s credit facility in july and again in october deferred financing costs are being amortized over the estimated term of the related obligations  which approximates the effective interest method 
dividend income 
dividend income increased to million during as a result of investments in marketable securities of master limited partnerships 
the company did not have these investments in income from discontinued operations 
the income from discontinued operations in is primarily attributable to the net gain on sales of our oil and gas properties during provision benefit for income taxes

non controlling interest in net income of consolidated subsidiary 
non controlling interest in net income of consolidated subsidiary increased by million  or  as a result of the increase in earnings of markwest energy and an increase in ownership of non controlling interests commensurate with private placements and public offerings to finance acquisitions 
liquidity and capital resources markwest hydrocarbon standalone our primary source of liquidity  to meet operating expenses and fund capital expenditures  is cash flow from operations  principally from the marketing of ngls  and quarterly distributions received from markwest energy partners 
based on current volume  price and expense assumptions  we expect cash flow from operations and distributions from the partnership to fund our operations and capital expenditures in most of our future capital expenditures are discretionary 
during  we spent million for capital expenditures  consisting principally of computer hardware and software 
we own of the general partner of markwest energy partners  excluding interests held by certain employees and directors  but deemed owned by the company through the participation plan 
the general partner of markwest energy partners owns the general partner interest and all of the incentive distribution rights 
the incentive distribution rights entitle us to receive an increasing percentage of cash distributed by the partnership as certain target distribution levels are reached 
specifically  they entitle us to receive of all cash distributed in a quarter after each unit has received for that quarter  of all cash distributed after each unit has received for that quarter  and of all cash distributed after each unit has received for that quarter 
for the year ended december   we received million in distributions from our limited units  and million from our general partner interest  of which million represented payments on incentive distribution rights 
cash flows generated from our ngl marketing and natural gas supply operations are subject to volatility in energy prices  especially prices for ngls and natural gas 
our cash flows are enhanced in periods when the prices received for ngls are high relative to the price of natural gas we purchase to satisfy our keep whole contractual arrangements in appalachia 
conversely  they are reduced in periods when the prices received for ngls are low relative to the price of natural gas we purchase to satisfy such contractual arrangements 
under keep whole contracts  we retain and sell the ngls produced in our processing operations for third party producers  and then reimburse or keep whole the producers for the energy content of the ngls removed through the re delivery to the producers of an equivalent amount on a btu basis of dry natural gas 
generally  the value of the ngls extracted is greater than the cost of replacing those btus with dry gas  resulting in positive operating margins under these contracts 
periodically  natural gas becomes more expensive  on a btu equivalent basis  than ngl products  and the cost of keeping the producer whole can result in operating losses 
we entered into several new and amended agreements in september with one of the largest appalachia producers that allow us to significantly reduce our exposure to commodity price risk for approximately of our keep whole gas volumes 
under these agreements  the company is limited on the costs it would have to pay to the producer should natural gas becomes more expensive than the ngl product sales price  thereby mitigating the risk of incurring operating losses 
in connection with these agreements  we paid million of consideration to the producer  that is being amortized as additional cost of the gas purchased over the term of the contracts  october   through february  debt in october  the company entered into a million senior credit facility with a term of one year 
the million revolving facility has a variable interest rate based on the base rate or the london inter bank offering rate libor  as discussed below 
in october  november  and december  the company entered into the first  second and third amendment to the credit agreement 
the first amendment extended the term of the original agreement to november  the second amendment reduced the lending amount from million to million  of which million of availability is committed to a letter of credit  leaving million available for revolving loans 
the second amendment also extended the term of the revolving credit to december  the third amendment extended the term of the revolving credit to january  and reduced the lending amount from million to million  of which million of availability is committed to a letter of credit  leaving million available for revolving loans 
on january   the company entered into the first amended and restated credit agreement which reinstated the maximum lending limit of million for a one year term 
the credit facility bears interest at a variable interest rate  plus basis points 
the variable interest rate is typically based on libor  however  in certain borrowing circumstances the rate would be based on the higher of a the federal funds rate plus  and b a rate set by the facility s administrative agent  based on the us prime rate 
the basis points correspond to the ratio of the revolver facility usage as defined in the company credit facility to the borrowing base as defined in the company credit facility  ranging from to for base rate loans  and to for eurodollar rate loans 
the company pays a quarterly commitment fee on the unused portion of the credit facility at an annual rate of basis points 
under the provisions of the credit facility  the company is subject to a number of restrictions on its business  including restrictions on its ability to grant liens on assets  make or own certain investments  enter into any swap contracts other than in the ordinary course of business  merge  consolidate or sell assets  incur indebtedness other than subordinated indebtedness  make distributions on equity investments  declare or make  directly or indirectly  any restricted distributions 
as of december   the company had outstanding borrowings of million and no borrowing capacity 
we spent million for capital expenditures for the year ending december  we have budgeted million for  consisting principally of computer hardware and software 
we believe that cash on hand  cash received from quarterly distributions including the incentive distribution rights from markwest energy partners  and projected cash generated from our marketing operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements and fund our required capital expenditures  if any  for the foreseeable future 
cash generated from our marketing operations will depend on our operating performance  which will be affected by prevailing commodity prices and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
markwest energy partners the partnership s primary source of liquidity  to meet operating expenses and fund capital expenditures other than for certain acquisitions  are cash flows generated by its operations  and its access to equity and debt markets 
the equity and debt markets  public and private  retail and institutional  have been the partnership s principal source of capital used to finance a significant amount of its growth  including acquisitions 
during the first quarter of  the partnership borrowed million from its credit facility to finance the starfish acquisition 
in the fourth quarter of  the million javelina acquisition and then existing borrowings  were financed with an interim credit facility that was subsequently replaced by a new long term credit facility  as described below 
during the year ended december   the partnership spent million on capital expenditures  primarily for the construction of a new processing plant and gathering systems in east texas to handle its future contractual commitments  and construction of the new replacement cobb processing facility in appalachia 
the partnership borrowed approximately million  primarily to finance its acquisitions 
the partnership received approximately million in proceeds from a private placement of common units  which was used to pay down its credit facility 
on december   markwest energy operating company  llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of markwest energy partners lp  entered into the fifth amended and restated credit agreement partnership credit facility  which provides for a maximum lending limit of million for a five year term 
the credit facility includes a revolving facility of million and a million term loan  which can be repaid at any time without penalty 
the credit facility is guaranteed by the partnership and all of the partnership s subsidiaries and is collateralized by substantially all of the partnership s assets and those of its subsidiaries 
the borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at a variable interest rate  plus basis points 
the variable interest rate is typically based on the london inter bank offering rate libor  however  in certain borrowing circumstances the rate would be based on the higher of a the federal funds rate plus  and b a rate set by the facility s administrative agent  based on the us prime rate 
the basis points correspond to the ratio of the partnership s consolidated senior debt as defined in the partnership credit facility to consolidated ebitda as defined in the partnership credit facility  ranging from to for base rate loans  and to for eurodollar rate loans 
the basis points will increase by during any period not to exceed days where the partnership makes an acquisition for a purchase price in excess of million acquisition adjustment period 
borrowings under the partnership credit facility were used to finance  in part  the javelina acquisition discussed above 
on december   the available borrowing capacity under the partnership credit facility was million 
under the provisions of the partnership credit facility  the partnership is subject to a number of restrictions on its business  including restrictions on its ability to grant liens on assets  make or own certain investments  enter into any swap contracts other than in the ordinary course of business  merge  consolidate or sell assets  incur indebtedness other than subordinated indebtedness  make distributions on equity investments  and declare or make  directly or indirectly  any restricted payments 
at december   the partnership and its subsidiary  markwest energy finance corporation  also have million in senior notes outstanding  at a fixed rate of 
the notes mature on november  the proceeds from these notes were used to pay down our outstanding debt under our credit facility in october subject to compliance with certain covenants  we may issue additional notes from time to time under the indenture pursuant to rule a and regulation s under the securities act of the indenture governing the senior notes limits the activity of the partnership and its restricted subsidiaries 
the provisions of such indenture places limits on the ability of the partnership and its restricted subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness  declare or pay dividends or distributions or redeem  repurchase or retire equity interests or subordinated indebtedness  make investment  incur liens  create any consensual limitation on the ability of the partnership s restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends  make loans or transfer property to the partnership  engage in transactions with the partnership s affiliates  sell assets  including equity interest of the partnership s subsidiaries  make any payment on or with respect to  or purchase  redeem  defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value any subordinated obligation or guarantor subordination obligation except principal and interest at maturity  and consolidate  merge or transfer assets 
the partnership has agreed to file an exchange offer registration statement  or under certain circumstances  a shelf registration statement  pursuant to a registration rights agreement relating to the senior notes 
the partnership failed to complete the exchange offer in the time provided for in the subscription agreements april  and  as a consequence  is incurring an interest rate penalty of  increasing every days thereafter up to  until such time as the exchange offer is completed 
the partnership is currently being charged an interest rate penalty of 
the registration statement was filed on january   and the interest penalty ceased on march  cash generated from operations  borrowings under the partnership s credit facility and funds from its private and public equity offerings are its primary sources of liquidity 
the timing of the partnership s efforts to raise equity in the future  however  will be influenced by the partnership s inability to timely file its annual report on form k for the year ended december   and its quarterly report on form q for the quarter ending march  the partnership will no longer have the ability to incorporate by reference information from its filings into a new registration statement until june   should they choose to raise capital through a public offering registered on form s if the partnership raises additional capital through public debt or equity offerings  it is required to file a form s  which is a long form type of registration statement 
the requirement to file a form s registration statement will affect the partnership s ability to access the capital markets on a timely basis and may increase the costs of doing so 
the partnership believes  nonetheless  that funds from raising equity  together with cash generated from operations and borrowings under its credit facility  will be sufficient to meet both its short term and long term working capital requirements and anticipated capital expenditures 
funding of additional acquisitions will likely require the issuance of additional common units  the expansion of the partnership s credit facility  or both 
the partnership s ability to pay distributions to its unitholders and to fund planned capital expenditures and make acquisitions will depend upon its future operating performance 
that  in turn  will be affected by prevailing economic conditions in the partnership s industry  as well as financial  business and other factors  some of which are beyond its control 
the partnership has budgeted million for capital expenditures in  exclusive of any acquisitions  consisting of million for expansion capital and million for sustaining capital 
expansion capital includes expenditures made to expand or increase the efficiency of the existing operating capacity of its assets  or facilitate an increase in volumes within its operations  whether through construction or acquisition 
sustaining capital includes expenditures to replace partially or fully depreciated assets in order to extend their useful lives 
cash flow year ended december  in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities net cash provided by operating activities decreased by million during the year ended december   compared to the corresponding period of  primarily due to a greater net loss in  offset by increases in depreciation expense and amortization of intangibles  arising from the partnership s acquisition of javelina in november increases in inventory  customer margin deposits and prepaid fuel also contributed to the decline 
net cash used in investing activities during the year ended december   consisted primarily of the million for the javelina acquisition  million investment in starfish  capital expenditures of million for existing facilities and million for purchases of marketable securities  offset by million from sales of marketable securities

the fire from the leaked vapors resulted in property damage to five homes and injuries to some of the residents 
the pipeline owner  the us department of transportation  office of pipeline safety ops  and the company continue to investigate the incident 
the company notified its general liability insurance carriers of the incident and of the filed kentucky actions in a timely manner and is coordinating the defense of these third party lawsuits with the insurers 
at this time  the company believes that it has adequate general liability insurance coverage for third party property damage and personal injury liability resulting from the incident 
to date  the partnership has settled with several of the claimants for third party property damage claims damage to residences and personal property  in addition to reaching settlement for some of the personal injury claims 
these settlements have been paid for or reimbursed under the partnership s general liability insurance 
as a result  the company has not provided for a loss contingency 
pursuant to ops regulation mandates and to a corrective action order issued by the ops on november   pipeline and valve integrity evaluation  testing and repairs were conducted on the affected pipeline segment before service could be resumed 
based on  among other things  the successful integrity testing of the affected pipeline  ops authorized a partial return to service of the affected pipeline in october markwest is currently preparing its application for return to full service

commodity price sensitivity our earnings and cash flow are dependent on sales volumes and our ability to achieve positive sales margins on the product we sell 
the volumes of our sales and our margin on sales can be adversely affected by the prices of commodities  which are subject to significant fluctuation depending upon numerous factors beyond our control  including the supply of and demand for commodity products 
the supply of and demand for our products can be affected by  among other things  production levels  industry wide inventory levels  the availability of imports  the marketing of products by competitors  and the marketing of competitive fuels 
seasonality for the portion of our business that is affected by commodity prices  sales volumes also are affected by various other factors such as fluctuating and seasonal demands for products  changes in transportation and travel patterns and variations in weather patterns from year to year 
in general  we store a portion of the propane that we produce in the summer as well as pre purchase in the summer a portion of the natural gas that we are required to replace during the winter in accordance with our appalachian keep whole processing agreements 
effects of inflation inflation in the united states has been relatively low in recent years and did not have a material impact our results of operations for the years ended december   or although the impact of inflation has been insignificant in recent years  it is still a factor in the united states economy and may increase the cost to acquire or replace property  plant and equipment 
it may also increase the costs of labor and supplies 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
estimates are used in accounting for  among other items  valuing identified intangible assets  determining the fair value of derivative instruments  evaluating impairments of long lived assets  establishing estimated useful lives for long lived assets  valuing asset retirement obligations  and in determining liabilities  if any  for legal contingencies 
the policies and estimates discussed below are considered by management to be critical to an understanding of the company s financial statements  because their application requires the most significant judgments from management in estimating matters for financial reporting that are inherently uncertain 
see note of the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k for additional information on these policies and estimates  as well as a discussion of additional accounting policies and estimates 
investment in starfish on march   the partnership acquired its non controlling  interest in starfish pipeline company  llc starfish for million  which is accounted for under the equity method 
differences between the partnership s investment and its proportionate share of starfish s reported equity are amortized based upon the respective useful lives of the assets to which the differences relate 
for the year ended december   the partnership received dividends of million  and accrued million for a capital call 
the partnership s share of starfish s loss in was million 
the partnership s accounting policy requires it to evaluate operating losses  if any  and other factors that may have occurred  that may be indicative of a decrease in value of the investment which is other than temporary  and which should be recognized even though the decrease in value is in excess of what would otherwise be recognized by application of the equity method 
the evaluation allows the partnership to determine if an equity method investment should be impaired and that an impairment  if any  is fairly reflected in its financial statements the partnership believes the equity method is an appropriate means for it to recognize increases or decreases measured by gaap in the economic resources underlying the investments 
regular evaluation of these investments is appropriate to evaluate any potential need for impairment 
it uses the following types of triggers to identify a loss in value of an investment that is other than a temporary decline 
examples of a loss in value may be identified by an inability to recover the carrying amount of the investment  a current fair value of an investment that is less than its carrying amount  and other operational criteria that cause us to believe the investment may be worth less than otherwise accounted for by using the equity method 
intangible assets the company s intangible assets are comprised of customer contracts and relationships acquired in business combinations  recorded under the purchase method of accounting at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
using relevant information and assumptions  management determines the fair value of acquired identifiable intangible assets 
fair value is generally calculated as the present value of estimated future cash flows using a risk adjusted discount rate 
the key assumptions include contract renewals  economic incentives to retain customers  historical volumes  current and future capacity of the gathering system  pricing volatility  and the discount rate 
amortization of intangibles with definite lives is calculated using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the intangible asset 
the estimated economic life is determined by assessing the life of the assets to which the contracts relationships relate  likelihood of renewals  competitive factors  regulatory or legal provisions  and maintenance and renewal costs 
impairment of long lived assets the company evaluates its long lived assets  including intangibles  for impairment when events or changes in circumstances warrant such a review 
a long lived asset group is considered impaired when the estimated undiscounted cash flows from such asset group is less than the asset group s carrying value 
in that event  a loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long lived asset group 
fair value is determined primarily using estimated discounted cash flows 
management considers the volume of reserves behind the asset and future ngl product and natural gas prices to estimate cash flows 
the amount of additional reserves developed by future drilling activity depends  in part  on expected natural gas prices 
projections of reserves  drilling activity and future commodity prices are inherently subjective and contingent upon a number of variable factors  many of which are difficult to forecast 
any significant variance in any of these assumptions or factors could materially affect future cash flows  which could result in the impairment of an asset 
for assets identified to be disposed of in the future  the carrying value of these assets is compared to the estimated fair value  less the cost to sell  to determine if impairment is required 
until the assets are disposed of  an estimate of the fair value is re determined when related events or circumstances change 
derivative instruments sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  established accounting and reporting standards requiring that derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded at fair value and included in the consolidated balance sheet as assets or liabilities 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation  which is established at the inception 
to the extent derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges are effective  changes in fair value are recognized in other comprehensive income until the underlying hedged item is recognized in earnings 
effectiveness is evaluated by the derivative instrument s ability to offset changes in fair value or cash flows of the underlying hedged item 
any change in the fair value resulting from ineffectiveness is recognized immediately in earnings 
changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges  as well as the changes in the fair value of the underlying hedged item  are recognized currently in earnings 
any differences between the changes in the fair values of the hedged item and the derivative instrument represent gains or losses from ineffectiveness 
to the extent that the company elects hedge accounting treatment for specific derivatives  the company formally documents  designates and assesses the effectiveness 
as of december   no transactions had been designated for hedge accounting treatment 
in general  the company exempts those contracts that qualify as normal purchase and sale contacts from the mark to market requirements of sfas all other derivative instruments are marked to market through revenue 
revenue recognition the company generates the majority of its revenues from natural gas gathering and processing  ngl fractionation  transportation and storage  and crude oil gathering and transportation 
while all of these services constitute midstream energy operations  the partnership provides its services pursuant to six different types of arrangements 
in many cases  the partnership provides services under contracts that contain a combination of more than one of the arrangements 
the following is a description of the partnership s six arrangements 
fee based arrangements under fee based arrangements  the partnership receives a fee or fees for one or more of the following services gathering  processing  and transmission of natural gas  transportation  fractionation and storage of ngls  and gathering and transportation of crude oil 
the revenue the partnership earns from these contracts is directly related to the volume of natural gas  ngls or crude oil that flows through its systems and facilities and is not directly dependent on commodity prices 
percent of proceeds arrangements under percent of proceeds arrangements  the partnership generally gathers and processes natural gas on behalf of producers  sells the resulting residue natural gas and ngls at market prices and remits to the producers an agreed upon percentage of the proceeds based on an index price 
in other cases  instead of remitting cash payments to the producer  markwest energy partners delivers an agreed upon percentage of the residue gas and ngls to the producer and sells the volumes it keeps to third parties at market prices 
percent of index arrangements under percent of index arrangements  the partnership generally purchases natural gas at either a percentage discount to a specified index price  a specified index price less a fixed amount or a percentage discount to a specified index price less an additional fixed amount 
the partnership then gathers and delivers the natural gas to pipelines where it resells the natural gas at the index price 
keep whole arrangements under keep whole arrangements  the partnership gathers natural gas from the producer  processes the natural gas and sells the resulting ngls to third parties at market prices 
because the extraction of the ngls from the natural gas during processing reduces the btu content of the natural gas  the partnership must either purchase natural gas at market prices for return to producers or make cash payment to the producers equal to the difference in the energy content of the natural gas stream before and after processing 
settlement margin under settlement margin  the partnership is allowed to retain a fixed percentage of the natural gas volume gathered to cover the compression fuel charges and deemed line losses 
to the extent the partnership s gathering systems are operated more efficiently than specified per contract allowance  it is entitled to retain the difference for its own account 
condensate sales during the gathering process  thermodynamic forces contribute to changes in operating conditions of the natural gas flowing through the pipeline infrastructure 
as a result  hydrocarbon dew points are reached  causing condensation of hydrocarbons in the high pressure pipelines 
under those arrangements  condensate collected in the system is retained by us and sold at market prices 
under all six arrangements  revenue is recognized at the time the product is delivered and title is transferred 
it is upon delivery and title transfer that the company meets all four revenue recognition criteria  and it is at such time that the company recognizes revenue 
the company s assessment of each of the four revenue recognition criteria as they relate to its revenue producing activities is as follows persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 
the partnership s customary practice is to enter into a written contract  executed by both the customer and the partnership 
delivery 
delivery is deemed to have occurred at the time the product is delivered and title is transferred  or in the case of fee based arrangements  when the services are rendered 
to the extent we retain our equity liquids as inventory  delivery occurs when the inventory is subsequently sold and title is transferred to the third party purchaser 
the fee is fixed or determinable 
the partnership negotiates the fee for its services at the outset of its fee based arrangements 
in these arrangements  the fees are nonrefundable 
the fees are generally due within ten days of delivery or services rendered 
for other arrangements  the amount of revenue is determinable when the sale of the applicable product has been completed upon delivery and transfer of tile 
proceeds from the sale of products are generally due in ten days 
collectibility is probable 
collectibility is evaluated on a customer by customer basis 
new and existing customers are subject to a credit review process  which evaluates the customers financial position eg cash position and credit rating and their ability to pay 
if collectibility is not considered probable at the outset of an arrangement in accordance with the partnership s credit review process  revenue is recognized when the fee is collected 
certain revenue from sales of customer gas to a third party processor is recognized net  under eitf  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  as the partnership earns a fixed amount and does not take ownership of the gas 
gas volumes received may be different from gas volumes delivered  resulting in gas imbalances 
the partnership records a receivable or payable for such imbalances based upon the contractual terms of the purchase agreements 
revenues for the transportation of crude are based upon regulated tariff rates and the related transportation volumes and are recognized when delivery of crude is made to the purchaser or other common carrier pipeline 
as described above  changes in the fair value of commodity derivative instruments are recognized currently in revenue 
stock and incentive compensation plans the company has elected to continue to measure compensation costs for unit based employee compensation plans as prescribed by accounting principles board apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  as permitted under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
stock options are issued under the company s stock incentive plan and non employee director stock option plan 
the plans allow for the exercise of stock options using the cashless method  but only at the discretion of the company 
under a cashless exercise  the company withholds those shares that otherwise would be issued upon the exercise of the option  the number of shares with a fair market value equal to the option exercise price and remits the remaining shares to the employees 
prior to april  the company did not allow participants to exercise their stock options using the cashless method 
accordingly  compensation expense was not recognized for stock options granted unless the options were granted at an exercise price less than the quoted market price of the company on the grant date 
in april  the company changed its policy to allow participants to exercise their stock options using the cashless method 
under apb no 
 a fixed stock option plan that permits the use of a cashless exercise becomes variable if a pattern of exercising the stock options using the cashless method is demonstrated 
as a result  in april  the company was required to account for stock options issued under the plans as variable awards 
compensation expense for stock options issued as variable awards is measured as the difference in the market value of the company s common stock and the exercise price of the stock options 
the difference is amortized into earnings over the period of service as the options vest  adjusted quarterly for the change in the fair value of the unvested stock options awarded 
increases or decreases in the market value of the company s common stock between april and the end of each reporting period result in a change in the measure of compensation for vested awards  which is reflected currently in operations in selling  general and administrative expenses 
the company also issues restricted stock under the company s stock incentive plan and non employee director stock option plan 
in accordance with apb no 
 the company applies fixed accounting for the plans 
as a result  since the restricted stock is granted for no consideration  compensation expense is recognized on the date of grant equal to the market price of the company s common stock 
the fair value of the stock awarded is amortized into earnings over the period of service 
the restricted stock vests over a stated period 
these charges are included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
the company has also entered into arrangements with certain directors and employees of the company referred to as the participation plan 
periodically  the company sells subordinated partnership units of the partnership  and interests in the partnership s general partner  to employees and directors of the company under a purchase and sale agreement 
in accordance with the provisions of apb no 
 the participation plan is accounted for as a variable plan 
since the employees and directors are vested except for two non executives who have restricted general partnership interests on the date they purchase the subordinated units or general partner interests  compensation expense for the subordinated units is measured as the difference in the market value of the subordinated partnership units and the amount paid by those individuals 
compensation related to the general partner interest is calculated as the difference in the formula value and the amount paid by those individuals 
the formula value is the amount markwest hydrocarbon would have to pay the directors and employees to repurchase the general partner interests and is based on the current market value of the partnership s common units and the current quarterly distribution paid 
increases or decreases in the market value of the subordinated units and the formula value of the general partner interests between the date they are acquired and the end of each reporting period result in a change in the measure of compensation  which is reflected currently in the statement of operations 
under topic b of the codification of the staff accounting bulletins  allocation of expenses and related disclosure in financial statements of subsidiaries  divisions or lesser business components of another entity  compensation expense related to services provided by markwest hydrocarbon s employees and directors recognized under the participation plan should be allocated to the partnership 
the allocation is based on the percent of time that each employee devotes to the company 
compensation attributable to interests that were sold to individuals who serve on both the board of markwest hydrocarbon and the partnership s board of directors is allocated equally 
the partnership issues restricted units under the markwest energy partners  lp long term incentive plan 
a restricted unit is a phantom unit that entitles the grantee to receive a common unit upon the vesting of the phantom unit or  at the discretion of the compensation committee  cash equivalent to the value of a common unit 
in accordance with apb  the partnership applies variable accounting for the plan because a phantom unit is an award to employees entitling them to increases in the market value of the partnership s units subsequent to the date of grant without issuing units to the employees  similar to a stock appreciation right 
as a result  the partnership is required to mark to market the awards at the end of each reporting period 
compensation expense is measured for the phantom unit grants using the market price of markwest energy partners common units on the date the units are granted 
the fair value of the units awarded is amortized into earnings over the period of service  adjusted quarterly for the change in the fair value of the unvested units granted 
the phantom units vest over a stated period 
vesting is accelerated for certain employees  if specified performance measures are met 
the accelerated vesting criteria provisions are based on annualized distribution goals 
if the partnership s distributions are at or above the goal for a certain number of consecutive quarters  vesting of the employee s phantom units is accelerated 
the vesting of any phantom units  however  may not occur until at least one year following the date of grant 
the general partner of the partnership may also elect to accelerate the vesting of outstanding awards  which results in an immediate charge to operations for the unamortized portion of the award 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment 
this statement addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for a equity instruments of the enterprise  or b liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
sfas no 
r requires an entity to recognize the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation issued to employees in the income statement 
the revised statement requires that an entity account for those transactions using the fair value based method  and eliminates the intrinsic value method of accounting in apb  accounting for stock issued to employees  which was permitted under sfas no 
 as originally issued 
the revised statement requires entities to disclose information about the nature of the share based payment transactions and the effects of those transactions on the financial statements 
sfas r is effective for public companies for the first fiscal year beginning after december  all public companies must use either the modified prospective or the modified retrospective transition method 
we have not yet evaluated the impact of the adoption of this pronouncement  which must be adopted in the first quarter of calendar year on march   the sec staff issued sab no

this statement a permits fair value remeasurement for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation  b clarifies which interest only strips and principal only strips are not subject to the requirements of sfas  c establishes a requirement to evaluate beneficial interests in securitized financial assets to identify interests that are freestanding derivatives or that are hybrid financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation  d clarifies that concentrations of credit risk in the form of subordination are not embedded derivatives  and  e eliminates restrictions on a qualifying special purpose entity s ability to hold passive derivative financial instruments that pertain to beneficial interests that are or contain a derivative financial instrument 
the standard also requires presentation within the financial statements that identifies those hybrid financial instruments for which the fair value election has been applied and information on the income statement impact of the changes in fair value of those instruments 
the company is required to apply sfas to all financial instruments acquired  issued or subject to a remeasurement event beginning january   although early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an entity s fiscal year 
the provisions of sfas are not expected to have an impact recorded at adoption 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk includes the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
we face market risk from commodity price changes and  to a lesser extent  interest rate changes 
commodity price risk our primary risk management objective is to manage volatility in our cash flows 
a committee  which includes members of senior management  oversees all of our derivative activity 
we may utilize a combination of fixed price forward contracts  fixed for floating price swaps and options on the over the counter otc market 
the company may also enter into futures contracts traded on the new york mercantile exchange nymex 
swaps and futures contracts allow us to manage volatility in our margins because corresponding losses or gains on the financial instruments are generally offset by gains or losses in our physical positions 
we enter into otc swaps with financial institutions and other energy company counterparties 
we conduct a standard credit review on counterparties and have agreements containing collateral requirements where deemed necessary 
we use standardized swap agreements that allow for offset of positive and negative exposures 
we may be subject to margin deposit requirements under otc agreements with non bank counterparties and nymex positions 
the use of derivative instruments may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances  including instances when i ngls do not trade at historical levels relative to crude oil  ii sales volumes are less than expected requiring market purchases to meet commitments  or iii our otc counterparties fail to purchase or deliver the contracted quantities of natural gas  ngls or crude oil or otherwise fail to perform 
to the extent that we enter into derivative instruments  we may be prevented from realizing the benefits of favorable price changes in the physical market 
we are similarly insulated  however  against unfavorable changes in such prices 
markwest hydrocarbon risk management activity since year end and as of march   markwest hydrocarbon has pre purchased natural gas for shrink requirements in future months and has entered into forward financial ngl sales to manage frac spread risk 
the following table includes information on our specific derivative activities commodity period quantity average price natural gas pre bought oct dec  mmbtu propane oct dec  gal iso butane oct dec  gal normal butane oct dec  gal natural gasoline oct dec  gal hydrocarbon may enter into additional physical and or financial positions to manage its risks related to commodity price exposure 
due to timing of gas purchases and liquid sales  direct exposure to either gas or liquids can be created because there is no longer an offsetting purchase or sale that remains exposed to market pricing 
through our marketing and derivatives activity  direct exposure may occur naturally or we may choose direct exposure to either gas or liquids when we favor that exposure over frac spread risk 
the partnership s derivative activity as part of an ongoing comprehensive risk management plan  designed to manage risk and stabilize future cash flows  the partnership has entered into the following derivative instruments that settle monthly through december  fair value at costless collars period floor cap december  crude oil bbl d crude oil bbl d crude oil bbl d propane  gal d propane  gal d propane  gal d jan june ethane  gal d natural gas  mmbtu d jan mar natural gas  mmbtu d april oct natural gas  mmbtu d nov mar natural gas mmbtu d jan mar natural gas mmbtu d april june fair value at swaps fixed price december  crude oil bbl d crude oil bbl d crude oil bbl d fair value is based on available market information for the particular derivative instrument  and incorporates the commodity  period  volume and pricing 
positive negative amounts represent unrealized gains losses 
while we expect these derivative instruments to provide economic stability against the impact of changing commodity prices on our physical positions  for accounting purposes  we will not designate these derivatives as cash flow hedges and will not apply hedge accounting 
as a result of the partnership s decision not to designate these derivatives as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes  we are required to mark each contract to market with the resulting unrealized gain or loss recorded in revenue in the income statement 
for the year ended december   unrealized losses of approximately  were recorded 
the fair value of our derivative contracts at december  of  was recorded as a derivative liability 
changes in forward price curves can result in significant changes in the fair value of our derivative contracts as reported  however  we expect the actual settlements to be largely offset by changes in the settlement of our physical positions 
interest rate risk the company s primary interest rate risk exposure results from the partnership s million long term debt agreement entered into on december  the debt related to this agreement bears interest at variable rates that are tied to either the us prime rate or libor at the time of borrowing 
we may make use of interest rate swap agreements in the future  to adjust the ratio of fixed and floating rates in the partnership s debt portfolio 
long term debt due outstanding at december  variable rate million january  million variable rate million december  million fixed rate million november  million
