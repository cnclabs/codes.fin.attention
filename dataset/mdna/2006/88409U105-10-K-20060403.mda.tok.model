item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation executive summary the company designs  manufactures and sells voice processing equipment for use primarily in telecommunications service providers central offices 
the company s products include intelligent announcers  media servers and application servers 
these products facilitate the deployment of voice resources in service providers networks  both traditional circuit switched networks  as well as the next generation of packet based networks 
beginning in  expenditures for network development decreased significantly reflecting a decline in the competitive local exchange carrier market and reduced capital spending by large service providers 
this trend intensified in and continued into the company believes that the market for telecommunication equipment over the past several years has stabilized and is growing in certain areas  but the timing of such spending continues to be uncertain and may be adversely impacted by mergers and acquisitions among telecommunications service providers 
established service providers are looking for ways to offer additional features on their legacy networks while they institute a multi year plan to transition to ip based multimedia services 
to effectively compete  the company must expand its penetration in the market  increase the applications available on its intelligent peripherals  media servers and application servers and increase the capacity of its media servers 
capital spending in the markets the company serves can vary over a short period of time and change rapidly

forming a conclusion that such an allowance is not needed is difficult when there is evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years 
the provision for income taxes is discussed in note g to the consolidated financial statements 
the effect of inflation has not had a significant impact on the operating results of the company over the past few years 
techno logical advances and productivity improvements are continually being applied to reduce costs  thus reducing inflationary pressures on the operating results of the company

million  increasing the current level of expenditures for research and development and may repurchase up to  shares of its common stock in based on current operating results  management believes that the cash and cash equivalents at december  will be sufficient to fund the company s cash requirements for  however  if the company s operations deteriorate due to increased competition  loss of a large customer or otherwise  it may be required to obtain additional sources of funds through asset sales  capital market transactions or financing from third parties or a combination thereof 
the company cannot provide assurances that these additional sources of funds will be available or  if available  what the terms would be 
assumptions and estimates used in critical accounting policies in the preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  management must make critical decisions regarding accounting policies and judgments regarding their application 
materially different amounts could be reported under different circumstances and conditions 
revenue we generally recognize product revenue  net of sales discounts and allowances  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  shipment or delivery dependent upon the terms of the sale has occurred  all significant contractual obligations have been satisfied  the amount is fixed or determinable and collection is considered probable 
sales of services and system support are deferred and recognized ratably over the contract period 
inventories slow moving and obsolescence due to a prolonged slow down in spending by telecommunications service providers  inventory turnover has slowed 
the company recorded charges of 
million and 
million in and  respectively  to reduce its carrying value of inventory to the lower of cost or market 
if future capital expenditures by telecommunications service providers do not increase or decrease further  additional charges may be required 
deferred tax assets as of december   the company has a valuation allowance of million for net deferred tax assets 
in making such a determination  the company considers its current and past performance  the market environment in which it operates  estimated future earnings  tax planning strategies and other factors 
in the future  as these factors change  a change in the valuation reserve may be required 
the company will only recognize a deferred tax asset when  based upon available evidence  realization is more likely than not and will provide a valuation allowance as necessary 
pensions the company accounts for its defined benefit pension plan in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
in  the company applied to the pension benefit guarantee corporation and the internal revenue service for permission to terminate the company s defined benefit plan 
reflecting this  the company adjusted the discount rate used to calculate the plan liabilities to 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company does not use derivative financial instruments 
the company s marketable securities consist of short term and or variable rate instruments and therefore a change in interest rates would not have a material impact on the value of these securities
