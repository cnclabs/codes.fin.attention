overview we are a leading provider of comprehensive digital map information for automotive navigation systems  mobile navigation devices and internet based mapping applications 
our map database enables providers of these products and services to offer dynamic navigation  route planning  location based services and other geographic information based products and services to consumer and commercial users 
in connection with a registration rights agreement between philips consumer electronic services bv philips bv and us  philips bv exercised its first demand registration right on april  pursuant to this request  we filed a registration statement on form s reg 
no 
on april  with the securities and exchange commission to register our common stock in an initial public offering  which became effective on august  the initial public offering was completed on august  at closing  philips bv and navpart i bv  the other selling stockholder  received all of the proceeds from the sale of shares in the offering 
philips bv exercised its second demand registration right on march  pursuant to this request  we filed a registration statement on form s reg 
no 
on march  with the securities and exchange commission to register our common stock held by philips bv in a secondary public offering  which was consummated on may  our selling stockholder  philips bv  received all of the proceeds from the sale of shares in the offering 
in the offering  philips bv sold  shares of common stock  which represented its entire remaining interest in the company 
revenue we generate revenue primarily through the licensing of our database in north america and europe 
revenue grew and in and  respectively 
the largest portion of our revenue comes from digital map data used in self contained hardware and software systems installed in vehicles 
we believe that there are two key factors that affect our performance with respect to this revenue the number of automobiles sold for which navigation systems are either standard or an option adoption and the rate at which car buyers select navigation systems as an option take rate 
the adoption of navigation systems in automobiles and the take rates have increased during recent years and we expect that these will continue to increase for at least the next few years as a result of market acceptance by our customers of products and services that use our database 
as the adoption of navigation systems in automobiles and the take rates increase  we believe each of these can have a positive effect on our revenue  subject to our ability to maintain our license fee structure and customer base 
in addition  the market for products and services that use our database is evolving  and we believe that much of our future success depends upon the development of a wider variety of products and services that use our database 
this includes growth in location enabled mobile devices  such as mobile phones  personal digital assistants pdas  personal navigation devices pnds and other products and services that use digital map data 
while use of our map database in mobile phones and in location based products and services is still largely in development and just beginning to enter the marketplace  there are a number of personal digital assistants and personal navigation devices currently on the market in both europe and north america that use our map database for turn by turn route guidance  including products offered by garmin  dell and thales 
our revenue growth is driven  in part  by the rate at which consumers and businesses purchase these products and services  which in turn is affected by the availability and functionality of such products and services 
we believe that both of these factors have increased in recent years and will continue to increase for at least the next few years 
however  even if these products and services continue to be developed and marketed by our customers and gain market acceptance  we may not be able to license the database at prices that will enable us to maintain profitable operations 
moreover  the market for map information is highly competitive  and competitive pressures in this area may result in price reductions for our database  which could materially adversely affect our business and prospects 
we have also experienced  and expect to continue to experience  difficulty in maintaining the license fees we charge for our digital map database due to a number of factors  including automotive and mobile device customer expectations of continually lower license fees each year and a highly competitive environment 
as a consequence of tele atlas acquisition of gdt in july  there may be additional price pressure on our license fees in order for us to compete effectively with the combined company 
in addition  governmental and quasi governmental entities are increasingly making map data information with higher quality and greater coverage available free of charge or at lower prices 
customers may determine that the data offered by such entities is an adequate alternative to our map database for some of their applications 
additionally  the availability of this data may encourage new entrants into the market by decreasing the cost to build a map database similar to ours 
in response to these pressures  we are focused on offering a digital map database with superior quality  detail and coverage  providing value added services to our customers such as distribution services  and technical and marketing support  and enhancing and extending our product offering by adding additional content to our map database such as integrated real time traffic data  enhancements to support advanced driver assistance systems applications that improve vehicle safety and performance  and enriched points of interest  such as restaurant reviews  hours of operation and parking availability 
we also believe that in the foreseeable future the effect on our revenue and profitability as a result of any decreases in our license fees will be offset by volume increases as the market for products and services that use our database grows  although we cannot assure you that these increases will occur 
operating expenses our operating expenses are comprised of database creation and distribution costs  and selling  general and administrative expenses 
database creation and distribution costs primarily include the purchase and licensing of source maps and employee compensation related to the construction  maintenance and delivery of our database 
selling  general and administrative expenses primarily include employee compensation  marketing  facilities and other administrative expenses 
our operating expenses have increased as we have made investments related to the development  improvement and commercialization of our database 
our operating expenses grew and in and  respectively 
operating expenses as a percentage of revenue were  and in  and  respectively 
we anticipate that operating expenses will continue to increase as our growth and development activities continue  including further development and enhancement of our database and increasing our sales and marketing efforts 
during and  we granted restricted stock units rsus to certain of our directors and employees under our stock incentive plan 
the rsus are securities that require us to deliver to the holder one share of our common stock for each vested unit 
compensation expense is recognized ratably over the vesting periods of each tranche of the rsus using a fair value equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of the grant 
we recognized compensation expense of  and  related to the grants of the restricted stock units during the years ended december  and  respectively 
we have historically obtained software  software related consulting services  treasury services  tax consulting services  insurance services and purchasing services on favorable terms through our participation in koninklijke philips electronics nv s philips programs  which we believe have resulted in operating expense savings for us of approximately  to  per year 
pursuant to a separation agreement with philips effective upon the closing of the initial public offering in august  we can no longer obtain software  software related consulting services  treasury services  tax consulting services and insurance from or through philips 
we ceased participating in philips purchasing programs after march  income taxes as of december   we had us net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately  and  respectively 
the difference between the federal and state loss carryforwards relate to certain limitations applicable to us because our principal operations were previously located in california 
these include a limitation on california loss carryforwards  capitalized research and development costs for california income tax purposes and a five year limit on california net operating loss carryforwards 
net operating loss carryforwards are available to reduce future taxable income subject to expiration 
various amounts of our net operating loss carryforwards expire  if not utilized  each year until the following table details the timing of the expiration of our net operating loss carryforwards year of expiration federal net operating loss carryforwards state net operating loss carryforwards federal tax credit carryforwards thereafter through as of december   we also had net operating loss carryforwards in europe and canada of approximately  and  respectively 
the european loss carryforwards have no expiration date and the canadian loss carryforwards generally have a seven year carryforward period 
in addition  as of december   we had us interest expense carryforwards for both federal and state income tax purposes of approximately  prior to  we had fully provided a valuation allowance for the potential benefits of the net operating loss and interest expense carryforwards as we believed it was more likely than not that the benefits would not be realized 
during the fourth quarter of  we reversed the valuation allowance related to the net operating loss carryforwards and other temporary items as we believed it was more likely than not that we would be able to use the benefit to reduce future tax liabilities 
the reversal resulted in recognition of an income tax benefit of  in and a corresponding increase in the deferred tax asset on the consolidated balance sheet 
as of june   we had fully reserved for the tax benefits related to the interest expense carryforwards as we believed it was more likely than not that the benefits would not be realized 
at such time  we believed it was more likely than not that we would not realize the benefit associated with the interest expense carryforwards due to restrictions placed on the deductibility of the interest as a result of philips controlling interest in us and uncertainty about our ability to generate sufficient incremental future taxable income in the united states to offset the additional interest expense deductions 
during the third quarter of  philips relinquished its controlling interest in us after our initial public offering 
we are now allowed to deduct the deferred interest expense in tandem with our net operating loss carryforwards 
as a result  we reevaluated  in the third quarter of  whether it was more likely than not that the tax benefits associated with our net operating loss carryforwards together with our interest expense carryforwards would be realized 
based on that evaluation  we determined the amount of net deferred tax assets that we believed it was more likely than not that we would realize 
our estimate of the deferred tax assets that we expected was more likely than not to be realized did not require us to record an adjustment to the balance of the related valuation allowance prior to the third quarter of during the third quarter of  we recorded an income tax benefit of  related to the reversal of the valuation allowance on a portion of our deferred tax assets 
we also recorded the reversal of tax benefits of  related to deferred compensation 
in addition  we reversed the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets associated with stock based compensation  which resulted in an increase to additional paid in capital of  we reassessed the realizability of the deferred tax assets and made the determination that it is more likely than not that we would be able to realize the benefits of the deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards and deferred interest credits in the united states 
in reaching the determination  we considered both positive and negative evidence 
positive evidence included our strong recent revenue growth and operating performance  expectations regarding the generation of future taxable income  the length of available carryforward periods  our market position and the expected growth of the market 
negative evidence included our history of operating losses through and the likelihood of increased competition and loss of a significant customer 
from that analysis  we determined that sufficient evidence existed to conclude that it was more likely than not that the benefits of certain of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
accordingly  we reversed the related valuation allowance 
as of december   we had a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of  related to canadian net operating loss carryforwards and research and experimental tax credits 
during the fourth quarter of  we revalued the deferred tax asset on our balance sheet due to changes in statutory corporate income tax rates  resulting in a decrease to deferred tax assets and additional income tax expense of  this revaluation was primarily due to legislation in the netherlands enacted during the fourth quarter of that reduced statutory corporate income tax rates from to in stages over a four year period starting in the statutory corporate income tax rate was subsequently reduced to in the fourth quarter of during the fourth quarter of  we again revalued the deferred tax asset on our balance sheet due to changes in statutory income tax rates in the netherlands and changes in the apportionment of income among states in the united states  resulting in a decrease to deferred tax assets and additional income tax expense of legislation was enacted in the netherlands during the fourth quarter of that reduced the statutory corporate income tax rate to from 
cash and liquidity prior to the year ended december   we had been unprofitable on an annual basis since our inception  and  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of  we had historically financed our operations with borrowings from philips and the sale of preferred stock to philips 
philips has no obligation to provide us with any additional financing in the future 
in april  we declared a special cash dividend of  which was paid on june  to our common stockholders of record as of april  as of december   our balance of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities was  compared to  as of december   which represents an increase of  in addition  we have generated positive cash flow from operations for the past sixteen quarters 
foreign currency risk material portions of our revenue and expenses have been generated by our european operations  and we expect that our european operations will account for a material portion of our revenue and expenses in the future 
substantially all of our international expenses and revenue are denominated in foreign currencies  principally the euro 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in europe and other foreign markets in which we have operations 
accordingly  fluctuations in the value of those currencies in relation to the us dollar have caused and will continue to cause dollar translated amounts to vary from one period to another 
in addition to currency translation risks  we incur currency transaction risk whenever one of our operating subsidiaries enters into either a purchase or a sales transaction using a currency other than the local currency in which it receives revenue and pays expenses 
historically  we had not engaged in activities to hedge our foreign currency exposures 
on april   we entered into a foreign currency derivative instrument to hedge certain foreign currency exposures related to intercompany transactions 
see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
for the year ended december   we generated approximately of our net revenue and incurred approximately of our total costs in foreign currencies 
our european operations reported revenue of  for the year ended december   with every one cent change in the exchange rate of the euro against the dollar resulting in approximately a  change in our revenue and approximately a  change in our operating income 
our analysis does not consider the implications that these fluctuations could have on the overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment in the united states or europe 
customer concentration material portions of our revenue have been generated by a small number of customers  and we expect that a small number of customers will account for a material portion of our revenue in the future 
approximately of our revenue for the year ended december  was from one customer 
no other customer accounted for or more of our revenue for the year ended december  approximately of our revenue for the year ended december  was from two customers  accounting for approximately and  respectively  of our revenue 
approximately of our revenue for the year ended december  was from two customers  accounting for approximately and  respectively  of our revenue 
our top fifteen customers accounted for approximately  and of our revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the majority of our significant customers are automobile manufacturers and suppliers to automobile manufacturers 
conditions in the market for new automobiles generally and conditions affecting specific automobile manufacturers and suppliers may affect sales of vehicle navigation systems incorporating our database 
fluctuations in the automotive market have occurred in the past and are likely to occur in the future 
to the extent that our future revenue depends materially on sales of new automobiles equipped with navigation systems enabled by digital maps  our business may be vulnerable to these fluctuations 
reverse stock split on april   our board of directors and stockholders approved a reverse stock split of our common stock 
the ratio for the reverse stock split was for  as determined by our board of directors 
we amended our amended and restated certificate of incorporation on august  to effect the reverse split and to change the number of authorized shares of common stock to  all previously reported share amounts have been retroactively adjusted to give effect to the reverse split 
critical accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and make various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that  of the significant policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the following are critical accounting estimates  which may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with our audit committee  and our audit committee has reviewed this disclosure 
revenue recognition we derive a substantial majority of our revenue from licensing our database 
we provide our data to end users through multiple distribution methods  primarily media or server based 
for example  our customers produce copies of our data on various media  such as cd roms  dvds and other storage media 
our customers then distribute those media to end users directly and indirectly through retail establishments  automobile manufacturers and their dealers  and other redistributors 
the media may be sold by our customer separately from its products  bundled with its products or otherwise incorporated into its products 
we also produce copies of our data and distribute those copies to end users both directly and indirectly through automobile manufacturers and their dealers 
in those cases where we produce and distribute copies to end users  the copies are either compiled into our customers proprietary format for use with the customers products or are in our common database physical storage format 
additionally  some of our customers store our data on servers and distribute information  such as map images and driving directions  derived from our data over the internet and through other communication networks 
revenue is recognized net of provisions for estimated uncollectible amounts and anticipated returns 
our map database license agreements provide evidence of our arrangements with our customers  and identify key contract terms related to pricing  delivery and payment 
we do not recognize revenue from licensing our database until delivery has occurred and collection is considered probable 
we provide for estimated product returns at the time of revenue recognition based on our historical experience for such returns  which have not been material 
as a result  we do not believe there is significant risk of recognizing revenue prematurely 
for revenue distributed through the media based method  license fees from usage including license fees in excess of the nonrefundable minimum fees are recognized in the period in which they are reported by the customer to us 
prepaid licensing fees are recognized in the period in which the distributor or customer reports that it has shipped our database to the end user 
revenue for direct sales is recognized when the database is shipped to the end user 
for revenue distributed through the server based method  revenue includes amounts that are associated with nonrefundable minimum licensing fees  license fees from usage including license fees in excess of nonrefundable minimum fees  recognition of prepaid licensing fees from our distributors and customers and direct sales to end users 
nonrefundable minimum annual licensing fees are received upfront and represent a minimum guarantee of fees to be received from the licensee for sales made by that party to end users during the period of the arrangement 
we generally cannot determine the amount of up front license fees that have been earned during a given period until we receive a report from the customer 
accordingly  we amortize the total up front fee paid by the customer ratably over the term of the arrangement 
when we determine that the actual amount of licensing fees earned exceeds the cumulative revenue recognized under the amortization method because the customer reports licensing fees to us that exceed this amount  we recognize the additional licensing revenue 
licensing arrangements that entitle the customer to unspecified updates over a period of time are recognized as revenue ratably over the period of the arrangement 
allowance for doubtful accounts we record allowances for estimated losses from uncollectible accounts based upon specifically identified amounts that we believe to be uncollectible 
in addition  we record additional allowances based on historical experience and our assessment of the general financial condition of our customer base 
if our actual collections experience changes  revisions to our allowances may be required 
we have a number of customers with individually large amounts due at any given balance sheet date 
any unanticipated change in the creditworthiness of one of these customers or other matters affecting the collectibility of amounts due from these customers could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations in the period in which these changes or events occur 
the allowance for doubtful accounts as reflected in our consolidated balance sheet reflects our best estimate of the amount of our gross accounts receivable that will not be collected 
our actual level of bad debts has been relatively stable in recent years  which we believe is due to our practice of requiring customer prepayments in certain instances together with prompt identification of potential problem accounts 
we continue to refine our estimates for bad debts as our business grows  and while our credit losses have historically been within both our expectations and the provision recorded  fluctuations in credit loss rates in the future may affect our financial results 
database creation  distribution and software development costs we have invested significant amounts in creating and updating our database and developing related software applications for internal use 
database creation and distribution costs consist of database creation and updating  database licensing and distribution  and database related software development 
database creation and updating costs are expensed as incurred 
these costs include the direct costs of database creation and validation  costs to obtain information used to construct the database  and ongoing costs for updating and enhancing the database content 
database licensing and distribution costs include the direct costs related to reproduction of the database for licensing and per copy sales and shipping and handling costs 
database related software development costs consist primarily of costs for the development of software as follows i applications used internally to improve the effectiveness of database creation and updating activities  ii enhancements to internal applications that enable our core database to operate with emerging technologies  and iii applications to facilitate customer use of our database 
costs of internal use software are accounted for in accordance with aicpa statement of position sop no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
accordingly  certain application development costs relating to internal use software have been capitalized and are being amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
it is possible that our estimates of the remaining economic life of the technology could change from the current amortization periods 
in that event  impairment charges or shortened useful lives of internal use software could be required 
impairment of long lived assets as of december  and  our long lived assets consisted of property and equipment  internal use software and acquired intangible assets 
we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
significant management judgment is required in determining the fair value of our long lived assets to measure impairment  including projections of future discounted cash flows 
realizability of deferred tax assets the assessment of the realizability of deferred tax assets involves a high degree of judgment and complexity 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences  as determined pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
management s evaluation of the realizability of deferred tax assets must consider both positive and negative evidence  and the weight given to the potential effects of positive and negative evidence is based on the extent to which it can be objectively verified 
we have generated significant taxable losses since our inception  and prior to the year ended december   management had concluded that a valuation allowance against substantially all of our deferred tax assets was required 
however  our european operations generated taxable profits throughout  and for the year ended december   both our european and us operations generated taxable income 
during  we assessed the realizability of our deferred tax assets by weighing both positive and negative evidence 
positive evidence included qualitative factors such as growing market acceptance of navigation products in europe and north america  particularly in automobiles  our leading competitive positions in both europe and the us  and the significant time required and cost involved in building a database such as ours 
positive quantitative evidence included our strong recent operating performance in both europe and the us  our projections of our future operating results that indicate that we will be able to generate sufficient taxable income to fully realize the benefits of our existing loss carryforwards before they expire  and the length of carryforward periods related to our net operating losses  approximately half of which have no statutory expiration date 
negative evidence included our history of operating losses through  the likelihood of increased competition and the loss of a large customer 
after evaluating the available evidence  management determined that sufficient objective evidence existed to conclude that it was more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax assets would be realized 
accordingly  we reversed the valuation allowance related to net operating loss carryforwards and other temporary items in europe and the united states  resulting in the recognition of an income tax benefit of  in as of june   we had fully reserved for the tax benefits related to interest expense carryforwards as we believed it was more likely than not that the benefits would not be realized 
at that time  we believed it was more likely than not that we would not realize the benefit associated with the interest expense carryforwards due to restrictions placed on the deductibility of the interest as a result of philips controlling interest in us and our ability to generate sufficient incremental future taxable income in the united states to offset the additional interest expense deductions 
during the third quarter of  philips relinquished its controlling interest in us after our initial public offering 
we were then allowed to deduct the deferred interest expense in tandem with our net operating loss carryforwards 
consequently  we reevaluated  in the third quarter of  whether it was more likely than not that the tax benefits associated with our net operating loss carryforwards and our interest expense carryforwards would be realized 
our evaluation considered both positive and negative evidence  and the weight given to the potential effects of positive and negative evidence was based on the extent to which it can be objectively verified in the same manner as described above for the evaluation completed in based on this evaluation  we determined the amount of net deferred tax assets that we believed was more likely than not that we will realize 
the amount that was determined did not require us to record an adjustment to the balance of the related valuation allowance 
during the third quarter of  we reassessed the realizability of the deferred tax assets and made the determination that it is more likely than not that we would be able to realize the benefits of the deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards and deferred interest credits in the united states 
in reaching the determination  we considered both positive and negative evidence 
positive evidence included our strong recent revenue growth and operating performance  expectations regarding the generation of future taxable income  the length of available carryforward periods  our market position and the expected growth of the market 
negative evidence included our history of operating losses through and the likelihood of increased competition and loss of a significant customer 
from that analysis  we determined that sufficient evidence existed to conclude that it was more likely than not that the benefits of certain of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
accordingly  we reversed the related valuation allowance and recorded a income tax benefit of  in addition  we reversed the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets associated with stock based compensation  which resulted in an increase to additional paid in capital of  as of december   we had a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of  related to canadian net operating loss carryforwards  and research and experimental tax credits 
we cannot assure you that we will continue to experience taxable income at levels consistent with recent performance in some or all of the jurisdictions in which we do business 
in the event that actual taxable income differs from our projections of taxable income by jurisdiction  changes in the valuation allowance  which could affect our financial position and net income  may be required

for the year ended december   we recognized a net foreign currency gain of  compared to a net foreign currency loss of  for the year ended december  the gain in primarily occurred before we entered into a foreign currency swap agreement to hedge the exchange rate effects on the aforementioned intercompany loan see note of notes to consolidated financial statements

income tax benefit expense 
the income tax benefit in was primarily due to the reversal of the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards 
during  we determined that it was more likely than not that we would be able to realize the benefit of the net operating loss carryforwards in europe and the united states 
the reversal of the valuation allowance together with the recognition of changes in other temporary differences resulted in our recording of a deferred income tax benefit of  and the recognition of a corresponding net deferred tax asset on our consolidated balance sheet 
in  we began recording an income tax provision based on our taxable income and applicable income tax rates in each jurisdiction  resulting in a tax provision of  during the fourth quarter of  we revalued the deferred tax asset on our balance sheet due to changes in statutory corporate income tax rates  resulting in a decrease to the asset and additional income tax expense of  bringing the total income tax provision to  this revaluation was primarily due to legislation in the netherlands enacted during the fourth quarter of that reduced statutory corporate income tax rates starting in from a rate of in to by the statutory corporate income tax rate was subsequently reduced to in the fourth quarter of current income tax expense of  in related to various foreign countries where we do not have tax loss carryforwards 
liquidity and capital resources since  we have financed our operations through cash generated from operating income 
as of december   cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled  in april  we declared a special cash dividend of  which was paid on june  to our common stockholders or record as of april  on november   we extended and increased  through our operating subsidiary for north america  our revolving line of credit that is now scheduled to mature on december  pursuant to the terms of the line of credit  we may borrow up to  at an interest rate of either us libor plus or the greater of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 
we are required to pay to the bank a quarterly facility fee of basis points per annum on the average daily unused commitment 
we have guaranteed our operating subsidiary s obligations under this facility 
as of december   there were no outstanding borrowings against this line of credit 
since the first quarter of  our operations have continued to produce positive cash flows 
the cash flows have been driven by increased demand for our products and our ability to deliver these products profitably and collect receivables from our customers effectively 
these funds have allowed us to make investments required to grow the business and have provided us excess cash 
we previously deposited cash in excess of our short term operational needs with philips pursuant to deposit agreements 
the deposit agreements expired on august   at which time we invested cash balances in excess of our short term operational needs in cash equivalents and marketable securities of high credit quality 
the following table presents our contractual cash obligations as of december  payments due by period contractual cash obligations total year or less years years after years operating leases we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements other than the operating leases identified in the table above 
we believe that our current cash resources on hand  temporary excess cash deposited in cash equivalents and marketable securities  and cash flows from operations  together with funds available from the revolving line of credit  will be adequate to satisfy our anticipated working capital needs and capital expenditure requirements at our current level of operations for at least the next twelve months 
we do  however  consider additional debt and equity financing from time to time and may enter into these financings in the future

 cash provided by operations cash used in investing activities cash provided by used in financing activities effect of exchange rates on cash increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents operating activities for each of the past three fiscal years  net cash provided by operating activities has improved significantly  primarily as a result of improved operating results driven by increased demand for our products 
in general  the growth in our operating assets and liabilities has coincided with the profitable growth in our business 
accounts receivable increased   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively  primarily due to the overall growth in our revenue 
in  our balance of deposits and other assets increased  primarily due to payments for third party content for our database 
accounts payable increased  and  during the years ended december  and primarily due to expenses incurred related to the growth of our operations and the timing of the related payments 
accrued payroll and related liabilities increased  during primarily due to the accrual of annual employee compensation programs that were paid in the first quarter of deferred revenue decreased  during the year ended december   as previous customer prepayments were recognized as revenue during the period 
deferred revenue increased  during primarily due to a  prepayment by a customer as described in the following paragraph  offset by revenue recognized 
the  payment was the result of an agreement that we entered into with a customer during the first quarter of whereby the customer agreed to prepay  the customer may apply a portion of the prepayment for license fees due to us in any calendar year under the agreement 
in the event the prepayment is not fully exhausted by the end of calendar year  the customer may extend the term of the agreement to the end of calendar year the prepayment was initially recorded as deferred revenue and will be recognized according to our revenue recognition policy as we receive royalty reports from the customer evidencing their use of the prepaid licenses 
the amount of recognition for prepaid licenses will be limited to  each fiscal year for  and accordingly   of the prepayment will be reported in short term deferred revenue 
with respect to the prepayment  we have no obligation to refund any unused amounts nor are there any restrictions on the nature or timing of our use of the cash received 
investing activities cash used in investing activities has primarily consisted of capitalized costs related to software developed for internal use  amounts placed on deposit with philips  purchases of marketable securities  capital expenditures and acquisitions 
we experienced temporary excess funds that were provided from operations for  and we put those funds on deposit with philips until august   since which we have invested such funds in cash equivalents and marketable securities 
the net increases in our deposits were  for for the year ended december   net deposits decreased by  because the related deposit agreements with philips expired upon completion of the initial public offering 
upon expiration of these deposit agreements  we invested cash balances in excess of our short term operational needs in cash equivalents and marketable securities 
during and  we invested  and  respectively in marketable securities 
costs for software developed for internal use have been capitalized in accordance with sop and are related to applications used internally to improve the effectiveness of database creation and updating activities  enhancements to internal applications that enable our core database to operate with emerging technologies and applications to facilitate usage of our map database by customers 
capitalized costs totaled   and  for   and  respectively

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest our cash in highly liquid cash equivalents and marketable securities 
we do not believe that our exposure to interest rate risk is material to our results of operations 
material portions of our revenue and expenses have been generated by our european operations  and we expect that our european operations will account for a material portion of our revenue and expenses in the future 
in addition  substantially all of our expenses and revenue related to our international operations are denominated in foreign currencies  principally the euro 
we are also subject to foreign currency exposure between the us dollar and the euro on the expected repayment of an intercompany obligation 
the intercompany balance is payable by one of our european subsidiaries to us and one of our us subsidiaries  and is due in us dollars 
through december   this intercompany balance was considered permanent in nature  as repayment was not expected to occur in the foreseeable future 
however  primarily as a result of improved operating performance in our european business  management concluded that cash flows would be sufficient to support repayment over the next several years 
accordingly  effective january   we adopted a plan for repayment and the loan was no longer designated as permanent in nature 
prior to april   we had not engaged in activities to hedge our foreign currency exposures 
on that day  we entered into a us dollar euro currency swap agreement the swap with koninklijke philips electronics nv to minimize the exchange rate exposure between the nv dollar and the euro on the expected repayment of the intercompany obligation 
the swap was assigned to an unaffiliated third party in the third quarter of the swap was not designated for hedge accounting 
under the terms of the swap  one of the company s european subsidiaries makes payments to the other party to the swap in euros in exchange for the us dollar equivalent at a fixed exchange rate of us dollar euro 
the us dollar proceeds obtained under the swap are utilized to make payments of principal on the intercompany loan 
the outstanding principal balance under the intercompany loan was million at april  the swap has a maturity date of december  and provides for settlement on a monthly basis in proportion to the repayment of the intercompany obligation 
as of december   the outstanding intercompany obligation net of payments was million 
for purposes of specific risk analysis  we use sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market risk exposures may have on the fair value of our swap 
the foreign currency exchange risk is computed based on the market value of future cash flows as affected by the changes in the rates attributable to the market risk being measured 
the sensitivity analysis represents the hypothetical changes in value of the hedge position and does not reflect the opposite gain or loss on the underlying transaction 
as of december   a decrease in the value of the euro against the us dollar with all other variables held constant would result in a decrease in the fair value of our swap liability of million  while a increase in the value of the euro against the us dollar would result in an increase in the fair value of our swap liability of million
