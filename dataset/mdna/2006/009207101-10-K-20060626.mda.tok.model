item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations during fiscal  the company decided to discontinue and dispose of its aircraft component parts brokerage and repair services business operated by its mountain aircraft services  llc mas subsidiary and  accordingly  the company s fiscal consolidated financial statements reflect the results of mas as a discontinued operation 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in august  the company completed the sale of certain assets of mas and entered into a three year consignment agreement granting the buyer an exclusive right to sell the majority of the remaining mas inventory included in the company s consolidated balance sheet as of that date 
consequently  mas s operations are not included in the fiscal results of continuing operations discussed below 
overview the company s continuing operations operate in two business segments  providing overnight air cargo services to the express delivery services industry and aviation ground support and other specialized equipment products to passenger and cargo airlines  airports  the military and industrial customers 
each business segment has separate management teams and infrastructures that offer different products and services 
the company s air cargo operations  which are comprised of its mountain air cargo  inc mac and csa air  inc 
csa subsidiaries  accounted for of revenue in fiscal the company s ground support operations  comprised of its global ground support  llc subsidiary global  accounted for the remaining of revenues 
mac and csa are short haul express air freight carriers and provide air cargo services exclusively to one customer  federal express corporation federal express 
under the terms of the dry lease service agreements  which currently cover approximately of the revenue aircraft operated  the company receives an administrative fee based on the number of aircraft operated in revenue service and passes through to its customer certain cost components of its operations without markup 
the cost of fuel  flight crews  landing fees  outside maintenance  parts and certain other direct operating costs are included in operating expenses and billed to the customer as cargo and maintenance revenue  at cost 
these agreements are renewable annually and may be terminated by federal express at any time upon days notice 
the company believes that the short term and other provisions of its agreements with federal express are standard within the air freight contract delivery service industry 
loss of its contracts with federal express would have a material adverse effect on the company 
separate agreements cover the five types of aircraft operated by mac and csa for federal express cessna caravan  atr  atr  fokker f  and short brothers sd cessna caravan  atr  atr and fokker f aircraft a total of aircraft at march  are owned by and dry leased from federal express  and short brothers sd aircraft two aircraft at march  are owned by the company and operated periodically under wet lease arrangements with the federal express 
pursuant to such agreements  federal express determines the type of aircraft and schedule of routes to be flown by mac and csa  with all other operational decisions made by the company 
the air cargo segment s financial results in fiscal were affected by federal express s decision to modernize the aircraft fleet being operated by mac under dry lease agreements by replacing older fokker f aircraft with newer atr and atr aircraft 
mac s administrative fees which are based on the number of aircraft operated in active or stand by service  although adversely affected in fiscal as a result of delays in the introduction of newer atr aircraft which were not received in time to replace the older fokker f aircraft that were removed from service as they neared major scheduled maintenance  increased in fiscal as the atr aircraft entered revenue service 
f revenue routes  affected by the delayed introduction of the atr s  were temporarily flown in fiscal by standby mac and csa aircraft or wet lease aircraft 
mac  which had been engaged to assist in the certification and conversion of atr aircraft from passenger to cargo configuration and had experienced a substantial increase in maintenance revenue in fiscal  experienced a substantial decrease in maintenance revenue in fiscal due to the completion of work once the aircraft were placed in revenue service 
the majority of these conversion activities  a portion of which represents cost of aircraft parts  have been billed to the customer without mark up 
mac and csa s revenue contributed approximately  and  to the company s revenues in fiscal and  respectively  a current year net increase of  
approximately  in increases in revenue in fiscal was related to increased pilot salaries and travel  fuel and airport fees associated with route expansion  the majority of which are passed on to the customer at cost  partially offset by a  decrease in maintenance services and acquisition of aircraft parts  which were primarily attributed to wind down and completion of the customer s fleet modernization  associated with conversion of atr aircraft from passenger to cargo configuration during fiscal global manufactures  services and supports aircraft deicers and ground support equipment and other specialized industrial equipment on a worldwide basis 
in june  global was awarded a four year contract to supply deicing equipment to the united states air force 
in june global was awarded a three year extension of that contract and a further three year extension was awarded in june in fiscal  revenues from sales to the air force accounted for approximately of the ground equipment segment s revenues 
global s revenues contributed approximately  and  to the company s revenues in fiscal and  respectively  a current year increase of 
the increase in revenues in was primarily due to increased commercial equipment orders  which included approximately  in international orders from china 
global s results in fiscal were adversely affected as the result of the collapse of one of twelve fixed stand deicing booms sold by global for installation at the philadelphia airport 
following the collapse of the boom  global undertook to examine and repair the eleven remaining booms and incurred expense of approximately  in connection these activities 
although global has initiated legal action to recover these expenses from its subcontractor  the company  cannot provide assurance of the amount or timing of any such recovery 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the following table summarizes the changes and trends in the company s operating expenses for continuing operations as a percentage of revenue fiscal year ended march  operating revenue in thousands expense as a percent of revenue flight operations maintenance ground equipment general and administrative depreciation and amortization total costs and expenses the company  which incurred an increase in professional fees in fiscal due to the additional requirements of the sarbanes oxley act sox of  reduced sox related professional fees in fiscal due to sec approved extensions in implementation deadlines which deferred additional requirements of the sox applicable to the company 
in particular  the requirements under section b of that act with respect to auditor attestation of internal controls over financial reporting 
outlook the company s current forecast for fiscal suggests that  due to higher fuel cost and increasing rates of inflation  the commercial aviation market will grow at a rate that is less than the rest of the economy 
increased international sales  military and homeland security budgets  pending funding approvals  and increased activity by outside service providers which have taken over the deicing responsibilities of several airlines and airports may help offset the expected lower than normal order levels from domestic passenger airline commercial customers 
company management currently anticipates that  although  its air cargo segment will continue to benefit from the increased administrative fees associated with its customer s aircraft fleet modernization and route expansion through fiscal  decreased maintenance revenues associated with the recent fleet modernization will reduce operating revenue and margins 
given the uncertainties associated with the above factors  the company continues to operate in a highly unpredictable environment 
based on the current general economic and industry outlook and recent cost cutting measures implemented over the past six months  the company believes its existing cash and cash equivalents  cash flow from operations  and funds available from current and renewed credit facilities will be adequate to meet its current and anticipated working capital requirements through fiscal if these sources are inadequate or become unavailable  then the company may pursue additional funds through the financing of unencumbered assets or sale of equity securities  although there is no assurance these additional funds will be sufficient to replace the sources that are inadequate or become unavailable 
actual results for fiscal will depend upon a number of factors beyond the company s control  including  in part  the magnitude of future international orders  the timing of receipt of additional customer aircraft placed into revenue service  the timing  speed and magnitude of the economic recovery of the aviation industry  military funding of pending future equipment orders  future levels of commercial aviation capital spending  future terrorists acts and weather patterns 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the company s financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires the use of estimates and assumptions to determine certain assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
management bases these estimates and assumptions upon the best information available at the time of the estimates or assumptions 
the company s estimates and assumptions could change materially as conditions within and beyond our control change 
accordingly  actual results could differ materially from estimates 
the most significant estimates made by management include allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  reserves for excess and obsolete inventories  warranty reserves  deferred tax asset valuation  retirement benefit obligations and valuation of long lived assets 
following is a discussion of critical accounting policies and related management estimates and assumptions 
a full description of all significant accounting policies is included in note of notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable in the amount of  and  respectively  in fiscal and  was established based on management s estimates of the collectability of accounts receivable 
the required allowance is determined using information such as customer credit history  industry information  credit reports  customer financial condition and the collectability of outstanding accounts receivables 
the estimates can be affected by changes in the financial strength of the aviation industry  customer credit issues or general economic conditions 
inventories 
the company s parts inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
provisions for excess and obsolete inventories in the amount of  and  respectively  in fiscal and  are based on assessment of the marketability of slow moving and obsolete inventories 
during fiscal the company wrote down the gross value of the mas inventory held for sale by  the value of the inventory s obsolescence reserve prior to the write down 
during fiscal the company sold approximately  of the inventory held at the end of fiscal historical part usage  current period sales  estimated future demand and anticipated transactions between willing buyers and sellers provide the basis for estimates 
estimates are subject to volatility and can be affected by reduced equipment utilization  existing supplies of used inventory available for sale  the retirement of aircraft or ground equipment and changes in the financial strength of the aviation industry 
the company warranties its ground equipment products for up to a two year period from date of sale 
product warranty reserves are recorded at time of sale based on the historical average warranty cost and are adjusted as actual warranty cost becomes known 
as of march  the company s warranty reserve amounted to  product warranty reserve activity during fiscal and fiscal is as follows balance at additions to reserve use of reserve balance at additions to reserve use of reserve balance at deferred taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities  net of valuation allowance in the amount of  and  respectively  in fiscal and  reflect the likelihood of the recoverability of these assets 
company judgment of the recoverability of these assets is based primarily on estimates of current and expected future earnings and tax planning 
retirement benefits obligation 
the company currently determines the value of retirement benefits assets and liabilities on an actuarial basis using a discount rate 
long term deferred retirement benefit obligations amounted to  and  respectively  in fiscal and values are affected by current independent indices  which estimate the expected return on insurance policies and the discount rates used 
changes in the discount rate used will affect the amount of pension liability as well as pension gain or loss recognized in other comprehensive income 
in  the compensation committee of the board of directors confirmed the level of retirement benefits under existing agreements for certain executive officers at amounts approximately  less than had been previously accrued 
based on an estimated average term to retirement of these officers of four years  the accrual was reduced by  in fiscal  and  subject to other adjustments  similar reductions would occur in the next three fiscal years 
the reduction in the accrual reduced general and administrative expense by that amount 
on december   the company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into an amended and restated employment agreement the amended employment agreement with john j 
gioffre  the company s chief financial officer 
the amended employment agreement amends and restates the existing employment agreement dated january  the former employment agreement  between the company  these subsidiaries and mr 
gioffre 
the amended employment agreement provides the terms and conditions for mr 
gioffre s continued employment with the company until his planned retirement on june  in connection with the execution of the amended employment agreement  the company paid to mr 
gioffre a  lump sum retirement payment he would have been entitled to receive under the former employment agreement had he retired on september   plus interest from that date at a rate equal to the company s cost of funds 
the company had previously accrued  in retirement benefit expense  and accordingly  the adjustment of  increased the company s results from operations for fiscal the amended employment agreement terminates the company s obligations to pay any further retirement or death benefits to mr 
gioffre 
pursuant to the amended employment agreement  mr 
gioffre is to be employed in his present capacities until june  with changes to his annual salary rate and bonus compensation 
revenue recognition 
cargo revenue is recognized upon completion of contract terms and maintenance revenue is recognized when the service has been performed 
revenue from product sales is recognized when contract terms are completed and title has passed to customers 
revenues from long term fixed price manufacturing projects are recognized on the percentage of completion method 
the company was not engaged in any long term  fixed price manufacturing projects in fiscal and valuation of long lived assets 
the company assesses long lived assets used in operations for impairment when events and circumstances indicate the assets may be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amount 
in the event it is determined that the carrying values of long lived assets are in excess of the fair value of those assets  the company then will write down the value of the assets to fair value 
the company has applied the discontinued operations provisions of sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets for the mas operations and has reflected any remaining long lived assets associated with the discontinued mas subsidiary at zero fair market value at march  and resignation of executive officer effective december   an executive officer and director of the company resigned his employment 
in consideration of approximately  payable in three installments over a one year period starting january   the executive agreed to forgo certain retirement and other contractual benefits for which the company had previously accrued aggregate liabilities of  the company has accounted for the resignation as a settlement under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit plans and for termination benefits 
the above mentioned cancellation of contractual retirement benefits reduced fiscal recorded liabilities by  the difference between the recorded liability and ultimate cash payment of  resulted in the recording of a  reduction in actuarial losses  recorded in other comprehensive loss  a  reduction in intangible assets and a net  reduction in executive compensation charges included in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 
the company also agreed to purchase from the former executive officer  shares of airt common stock held by him representing approximately of the outstanding shares of common stock at december  for per share of the january  closing price 
the stock repurchase took place in three installments over a one year period  starting january   and totaled approximately  the repurchase of the former executive s stock was recorded in the period that the repurchase occurred 
as of march  all payments required to be made under the above agreements had been made 
seasonality global s business has historically been highly seasonal 
due to the nature of its product line  the bulk of global s revenues and earnings have typically occurred during the second and third fiscal quarters in anticipation of the winter season  and comparatively little has occurred during the first and fourth fiscal quarters 
the company has continued its efforts to reduce global s seasonal fluctuation in revenues and earnings by increasing international sales and broadening its product line to increase revenues and earnings in the first and fourth fiscal quarters 
in june  global was awarded a four year contract to supply deicing equipment to the united states air force  and global has been awarded two three year extensions on the contract 
in march and december global  respectively  received a large scale  fixed stand deicer contract from the city of philadelphia and a large mobile deice equipment order from china  which the company believes contributed to management s plan to reduce seasonal fluctuation in revenues during fiscal and however  since these contracts have been completed  global is more susceptible to the resumption of historical seasonal trends 
the remainder of the company s business is not materially seasonal 
fiscal vs 
consolidated revenue from continuing operations increased  to  for the fiscal year ended march  compared to the prior fiscal year 
the increase in revenue primarily resulted from an increase in global revenue of  to  combined with a  increase in air cargo revenue to  in fiscal  as described in overview above 
the increase in global s revenue was primarily the result of an increase in the number of commercial deicing units sold by global  in part due to the order from china received in december the increase in air cargo revenue was primarily the result of an increase in expenses that are passed through to the customer at cost 
operating expenses from continuing operations increased  to  for fiscal compared to fiscal the net increase in operating expenses consisted of the following changes cost of flight operations increased  primarily as a result of increased direct operating costs  including pilot salaries and related benefits  fuel  airport fees  and costs associated with pilot travel  due to increased cost of oil  flight schedule changes and increased administrative staffing due to fleet modernization and route expansion programs  maintenance expenses decreased  primarily as a result of decreases in cost of contract services  maintenance personnel  travel  and outside maintenance related to the completion of customer fleet modernization  partially offset by increased operating cost related to the route expansion  ground equipment costs increased   which included increased cost of parts and supplies and support personnel related to increased customer orders and  in remediation costs associated with the failure of one of global s deicing booms in philadelphia  depreciation and amortization increased  as a result of purchases of capital assets 
general and administra tive expense increased  primarily as a result of a provision for bad debt expense  increased staffing and benefits  staff travel and profit sharing provision  offset by decreased professional fees due to a deferral in the implementation of sox section compliance 
on a segment basis  significant impacts on the company s operating results  comparing the fiscal year ended march  to its prior fiscal year  resulted from changes in both the ground equipment and air cargo sectors 
in the fiscal year ended march   global had operating income of  a decrease compared to prior period operating income of  global s current fiscal year operating income decreased compared to its prior fiscal year primarily due to current period s higher levels of commercial equipment orders  which more than offset the  in cost associated with the repair of deicing booms in philadelphia 
operating income for the company s overnight air cargo operations was  in the fiscal year ended march   an increase of from  in the prior fiscal year 
the net increase in air cargo operating income was due to federal express s decision to modernize the aircraft fleet being operated by mac under dry lease agreements by replacing older fokker f aircraft with newer atr and atr aircraft 
mac s administrative fees which are based on the number of aircraft operated in active or stand by service  although adversely affected in fiscal as a result of delays in the introduction of newer atr aircraft which were not received in time to replace the older fokker f aircraft that were removed from service as they neared major scheduled maintenance  increased in fiscal as the atr aircraft entered revenue service 
f revenue routes  affected by the delayed introduction of the atr s  were temporarily flown in fiscal by standby mac and csa aircraft or wet lease aircraft 
mac which had been engaged to assist in the certification and conversion of atr aircraft from passenger to cargo configuration and had experienced a substantial increase in maintenance revenue in fiscal  experienced a substantial decrease in maintenance revenue in fiscal due to the completion of work once the aircraft were placed in revenue service 
the majority of these conversion activities  a portion of which represents cost of aircraft parts  have been billed to the customer without mark up 
earnings from continuing operations in fiscal and  respectively  include  and  of residual cost related to the remaining mas parts inventory to be sold on consignment and cost of leased facilities previously operated by mas that the company has been unable to sublease 
non operating expense increased a net  primarily due to increased interest expenses related to increased borrowings on the company s bank line partly offset by increased interest earned on investments 
provision for income taxes decreased  primarily due to decreased pre tax earnings and a reduction in tax provision in the fourth quarter of associated with the true up of fixed asset tax differences included in deferred tax asset 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the provision for income taxes for the fiscal years ended march  and were different from the federal statutory rates primarily due to the above mentioned fiscal true up  state tax provisions and  to a lesser extent  permanent tax differences

in the fiscal year ended march   global had operating income of  a increase compared to prior period operating income of  global s fiscal operating income increased compared to its prior fiscal year primarily due to higher levels of military and commercial equipment orders in fiscal  partly offset by the prior period completion of a large scale airport contract for fixed stand deicers 
operating income for the company s overnight air cargo operations was  in the fiscal year ended march   a decrease of from  in the prior fiscal year 
the net decrease in air cargo operating income was due to a combination of temporarily decreased administrative fees which resulted from delays in the introduction of replacement atr aircraft  currently undergoing conversion to cargo configuration  as older cargo aircraft are phased out of service  and higher levels of current period administrative costs as additional staffing has been put in place to oversee the phase in and operations of the newer aircraft and route restructuring 
earnings from continuing operations in fiscal include  of residual cost related to the remaining mas parts inventory to be sold on consignment and cost of leased facilities previously operated by mas that the company has been unable to sublease

the company assumes various financial obligations and commitments in the normal course of its operations and financing activities 
financial obligations are considered to represent known future cash payments that the company is required to make under existing contractual arrangements such as debt and lease agreements 
the following table of material contractual obligations at march  summarizes the effect these obligations are expected to have on the company s cash flow in the future periods  as discussed below 
contractual obligations total less than year years years long term bank debt operating leases capital leases deferred retirement obligation total the respective years ended march   and resulted in the following changes in cash flow operating activities provided   and  investing activities used  and  respectively  in fiscal and and provided  in fiscal and financing activities used  and  in and and provided  in fiscal net cash decreased  in and increased  and  respectively  in fiscal and cash provided by operating activities was  less for the year ended march   compared to fiscal principally due to decreased accounts payable and payment of an executive retirement obligation  partially offset by increased accounts receivable associated with increased air cargo billings and equipment sales 
cash used in investing activities for the year ended march  was approximately  less than fiscal  principally due to decreased capital expenditures in the current year 
cash used by financing activities was  more in fiscal compared to fiscal principally due to the  financing of an airplane in   increased borrowings on line of credit and an increase of  in the current year s dividend payment  offset by  repurchase of common stock in prior year 
during the fiscal year ended march  the company repurchased  shares of its common stock for  as described above  under resignation of executive officer 
no stock repurchases were made in fiscal there are currently no commitments for significant capital expenditures 
the company s board of directors  on august   adopted the policy to pay an annual cash dividend in the first quarter of each fiscal year  in an amount to be determined by the board 
on may   the company declared a per share cash dividend  to be paid on june  to shareholders of record june  on may  the company declared a 
per share cash dividend  to be paid on june  to shareholders of record june  derivative financial instruments as required by sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  the company recognizes all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measures those instruments at fair value 
the company is exposed to market risk  such as changes in interest rates 
to manage the volatility relating to interest rate risk  the company may enter into interest rate hedging arrangements from time to time 
on october   the company terminated a  notional value interest rate credit line swap  entered into in may  for  the fair market value termination fee as of that date 
the  balance included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss as of march  was ratably amortized into interest expense during fiscal the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
as of march  the company had no derivative financial instruments outstanding 
the company is exposed to changes in interest rates on certain portions of its line of credit  which bears interest based on the day libor rate plus basis points

off balance sheet arrangements the company defines an off balance sheet arrangement as any transaction  agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has made guarantees  a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets  an obligation under derivative instruments classified as equity  or any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support to the company  or that engages in leasing  hedging  or research and development arrangements with the company 
the company is not currently engaged in the use of any of the arrangements defined above 
impact of inflation the company believes that the recent increases in inflation have not had a material effect on its manufacturing operations  because increased costs to date have been passed on to its customers 
under the terms of its air cargo business contracts the major cost components of its operations  consisting principally of fuel  crew and other direct operating costs  and certain maintenance costs are reimbursed  without markup by its customer 
significant increases in inflation rates could  however  have a material impact on future revenue and operating income
