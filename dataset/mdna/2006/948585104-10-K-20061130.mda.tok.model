overview we design and manufacture satellite communications equipment through wegener communications  inc wci  a wholly owned subsidiary 
wci is an international provider of digital solutions for video  audio and ip data networks 
applications include iptv  broadcast television  cable television  radio networks  business television  distance education  business music and financial information distribution 
compel  our patented network control system  provides network flexibility to regionalize programming  commercials and file transfers 
we operate on a week fiscal year 
the fiscal year ends on the friday nearest to august fiscal years and contained weeks while fiscal year contained weeks 
all references herein to  and  refer to the fiscal years ending september   september   and september   respectively 
our fiscal revenues decreased  or  to  from  in fiscal fiscal revenues were adversely impacted by engineering development delays of the ipump which was scheduled to begin shipping in the fourth quarter of fiscal shipments of the ipump product began during our first quarter of fiscal during the first quarter of fiscal  approximately million in new orders were booked 
four significant orders were received from two radio networks  a government agency and a private network 
ipump systems accounted for more than of these orders 
of these orders  approximately million remains to ship in fiscal during the second quarter of fiscal  we booked approximately million in new orders  including a million contract from bbc world services bbc utilizing our ipump system for its international radio distribution network 
the system allows the bbc to distribute audio to over partners globally through advanced digital file store forward technology  as well as traditional linear broadcasting 
approximately million of the bbc order remains to ship in fiscal additional bookings in fiscal included new orders from teracom  utilizing our ipump media server to support two pilot programs for digital signage to retail stores and distribution of video and data to retail gaming establishments  and from nielsen media research  inc  for the development and manufacture of the new spottrac tm encoder 
the nielsen spottrac tm encoder product is for commercial applications and is not for consumer in home use 
current developments we are continuing to invest in new technologies utilizing mpeg h 
video compression and dvb s satellite modulation combined 
mpeg h 
compression and dvb s modulation reduce bandwidth utilization by about half  which allows present networks to cut recurring costs by up to and allows the creation of new networks that were not possible with previous technologies 
alternately  our customers will be able to upgrade their video to high definition and significantly increase its quality while maintaining similar bandwidth utilization to their current mpeg standard definition offering 
the smd iptv settop and the unity version satellite receiver will be our first products with mpeg h 
technology  as we continue to explore other potential applications for the technology 
we expect the development of products utilizing mpeg h 
technology to continue throughout fiscal we believe that market demand for mpeg technology is very strong 
however  we are experiencing delays by customers in making equipment purchases until the new technology is available 
this caused a bookings shortfall in the fourth quarter of fiscal due to the low level of bookings  we anticipate a loss in operating results for our first quarter of fiscal however  bookings to date for the first quarter of fiscal year were stronger than the previous fourth quarter s level 
subsequent to september   approximately million in new orders were booked 
we are extremely focused on completing our first round of mpeg products to take advantage of the strong market demand for mpeg we expect our smd settop product for iptv applications will open new markets for us and potential additional product offerings for new and existing customers 
there are clearly higher risks present in this product line  which has a different business model with lower margin levels than our historical business  as well as significant competitors 
we are actively exploring multiple potential business arrangements for the product line 
in addition  the smd  as it is currently designed  is directly applicable to iptv applications within our current markets and provides the opportunity for new offerings to our existing customer base 

table of contents in addition to mpeg and dvb s technology development  we continue to invest in the ipump media server utilizing store forward technology 
we expanded the functionality of the ipump for use in the broadcast television  radio and news markets  where we have traditionally been strong and now have deployed networks with all three product options 
we continue to believe the ipump is the right product for our markets and will make a significant contribution to future revenues 
the ipump media server uses a store and forward approach to network operations compared to traditional real time video and audio delivery networks 
the ipump media server provides customers with many additional capabilities not available in traditional real time delivery networks  such as streaming video and audio to the desktop  more efficient use of expensive satellite bandwidth and the ability to originate two complete television networks from a single unit 
mediaplan i o and mediaplan cm modules provide control over storing and managing digital media content 
these features enhance network content management and ease of network operations 
financial position and liquidity we have no long term debt or line of credit borrowings outstanding at september  our cash and cash equivalents balances were  at september  our  bank loan facility  which is subject to availability advance formulas based on eligible accounts receivable  import letter of credit commitment balances and inventories  is currently being used to support import letters of credit issued to our offshore manufacturers  which at september  amounted to  compared to  at september  at september   approximately  net of the outstanding letters of credit was available to borrow under the advance formulas 
the increase in outstanding letters of credit is primarily due to our new product introductions of the ipump  unity and smd products  and for european orders requiring lead free unity receivers 
we have orders in our september   backlog scheduled to ship throughout fiscal for approximately  or of the outstanding letters of credit balances 
we expect in fiscal to book and ship orders for the remainder of the outstanding balances 
currently our bank allows of the value of letters of credit as collateral while reducing borrowing availability by the full amount of outstanding letter of credit balances 
as a result  we may at various times during fiscal  require overadvances to the bank s collateral formula until the letter of credit inventory commitments convert to receivables  against which the bank will allow as available collateral 
there is no assurance the bank will grant overadvances in sufficient amounts and for the duration of time required to support operations until the inventory is sold 
as a result we may need to obtain additional sources of financing 
no assurances may be given that additional sources of capital  if needed  would be available 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we began to utilize borrowings on the line of credit for payments against outstanding letters of credit and to support operations

fiscal revenues included two new orders from bbc world services and jones radio networks of ipump media servers  digital encoders and unity receivers for their broadcast radio networks 
additionally  fiscal included revenues on a new order from nielsen media research 
dbs revenues in fiscal were adversely impacted by engineering development delays of the ipump  which was scheduled to begin shipping in the fourth quarter of fiscal the analog and custom products group revenue decrease in fiscal reflected a continuing decline in orders for older analog and cue and control equipment

see note to the consolidated financial statements  segment information and significant customers 
future revenues are subject to the timing of significant orders from customers and are difficult to forecast 
as a result  we expect future revenue levels and operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
international sales are generated through a direct sales organization and through foreign distributors 
international sales were  or of revenues in fiscal compared to  or of revenues in fiscal  and  or of revenues in fiscal international shipments are generally project specific  and therefore revenues are subject to variations from year to year based on the timing of customer orders

the increase in expenditures in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to increased prototype part costs and placement fees 
software development costs totaling   and  were capitalized during fiscal  and  respectively 
the decreases in capitalized software costs in fiscal compared to fiscal were due to decreased expenditures on the ipump media server and compel products 
the decreases in capitalized software costs in fiscal compared to fiscal are due to decreased expenditures on the ipump media server  unity and dtv series products  which were partially offset by increased expenditures on the smd product 
research and development expenses  excluding capitalized software development costs  were  or of revenues in fiscal   or of revenues in fiscal  and  or of revenues in fiscal we expect fiscal research and development expenditures to approximate fiscal levels as we continue to develop and enhance dbs products incorporating mpeg h

interest expense was  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal and  in fiscal the increase in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to line of credit borrowings during fiscal and an increase in average outstanding letter of credit commitment balances 
interest expense in fiscal years and was principally associated with letters of credit commitments and bank float charges on lockbox collections 
the decrease in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to a decrease in the average outstanding letter of credit commitment balances 
we believe that interest expense in fiscal will increase compared to fiscal as a result of expected increases in line of credit borrowings  as well as potential increases in our loan interest rate  as further discussed in liquidity and capital resources 
interest income was  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal and  in fiscal interest income in fiscal included a one time benefit of  from interest paid on the collection of adelphia communications receivables 
the decrease in fiscal compared to fiscal was mainly due to lower average balances of cash and cash equivalents and by a one time benefit of  in fiscal related to the collection of a trade accounts receivable 

table of contents no income tax benefit was recorded in fiscal due to an increase in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance of  at september   net deferred tax assets of  were fully reserved by a valuation allowance for the reasons set forth in the paragraph below 
fiscal income tax expense of  was comprised of deferred federal and state tax expenses of  and  respectively 
federal and state tax expenses in fiscal included a fourth quarter noncash charge of  to provide a full valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires that a valuation allowance be established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
a review of all available positive and negative evidence must be considered in judging the likelihood of realizing tax benefits 
forming a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed is difficult when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years 
cumulative losses are one of the most difficult pieces of negative evidence to overcome in the absence of sufficient existing orders and backlog versus forecasted future orders supporting a return to profitability 
additional orders and backlog are currently needed to return to profitability in fiscal our assessment in applying sfas no 
indicated that a full valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets was required as of september  and september  the effect in fiscal was to reverse the benefits of net deferred tax assets that were recorded in prior years financial statements 
these tax benefits will be available  prior to the expiration of carryforwards  to reduce future income tax expense resulting from earnings or increases in deferred tax liabilities 
at september   we had a federal net operating loss carryforward of  of which  expires in fiscal   in fiscal   in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal additionally  we had an alternative minimum tax credit of  and a state income tax credit of  expiring in fiscal  all of which were fully offset by the valuation allowance 
fiscal income tax benefit of  was comprised of deferred federal and state tax benefits of  and  respectively 
net deferred tax assets increased  to  at september  the increase was principally due to increases in net operating loss carryforwards  offset by reductions of general business and foreign tax credits of  which expired september  a reconciliation of our effective income tax rate as compared to the statutory us income tax rate is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies certain accounting policies are very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most subjective or difficult judgements 
these policies are as follows revenue recognition our revenue recognition policies are in compliance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements and eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an agreement with the customer exists  products are shipped or title passes pursuant to the terms of the agreement with the customer  the amount due from the customer is fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured  and there are no significant future performance obligations 
service revenues are recognized at the time of performance 
revenues from separate extended service maintenance agreements are recognized ratably over the term of the agreements 
the unrecognized revenue portion of maintenance contracts invoiced is recorded as deferred revenue 
at september   deferred extended service maintenance revenues were  and deferred revenues related to future performance obligations were  and are expected to be recognized as revenue in varying amounts throughout fiscal we recognize revenue in certain circumstances before delivery has occurred commonly referred to as bill and hold transactions 
in such circumstances  among other things  risk of ownership has passed to the buyer  the buyer has made a written fixed commitment to purchase the finished goods  the buyer has requested the finished goods be held for future delivery as scheduled and designated by them  and no additional performance obligations exist by us 
for these transactions  the finished goods are segregated from inventory and normal billing and credit terms are granted 
for the year ended september   revenues to three customers in the amount of  were recorded prior to delivery as bill and hold transactions 
at september   accounts receivable for these revenues amounted to  and were paid in full subsequent to september  
table of contents these policies require management  at the time of the transaction  to assess whether the amounts due are fixed or determinable  collection is reasonably assured and no future performance obligations exist 
these assessments are based on the terms of the agreement with the customer  past history and creditworthiness of the customer 
if management determines that collection is not reasonably assured or future performance obligations exist  revenue recognition is deferred until these conditions are satisfied 
our principal sources of revenues are from the sales of various satellite communications equipment 
embedded in our products is internally developed software of varying applications 
we evaluate our products to assess whether software is more than incidental to a product 
when we conclude that software is more than incidental to a product  we will account for the product as a software product 
revenue on software products and software related elements is recognized in accordance with sop no 
 software revenue recognition as amended by sop no 
 software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
significant judgment may be required in determining whether a product is a software or hardware product 
inventory reserves inventories are valued at the lower of cost at standard  which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis or market 
inventories include the cost of raw materials  labor and manufacturing overhead 
we make inventory reserve provisions to properly reflect inventory value based on a review of inventory quantities on hand  sales forecasts  new products being developed and technology changes 
these reserves are to provide for items that are potentially slow moving  excess or obsolete 
changes in market conditions  lower than expected customer demand and rapidly changing technology could result in additional obsolete and slow moving inventory that is unsaleable or saleable at reduced prices  which could require additional inventory reserve provisions 
at september   inventories  net of reserve provisions  amounted to  capitalized software costs software development costs are capitalized subsequent to establishing technological feasibility 
capitalized costs are amortized based on the larger of the amounts computed using a the ratio that current gross revenues for each product bears to the total of current and anticipated future gross revenues for that product  or b the straight line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the product 
expected future revenues and estimated economic lives are subject to revisions due to market conditions  technology changes and other factors resulting in shortfalls of expected revenues or reduced economic lives  which could result in additional amortization expense or write offs 
at september   capitalized software costs  net of accumulated amortization  amounted to  deferred tax asset valuation allowance deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences  net operating loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards  if it is more likely than not that the tax benefits will be realized 
realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent on generating sufficient future taxable income prior to the expiration of the loss and credit carryforwards 
as discussed in the results of operations section of this md a  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a  non cash income tax charge to establish a full valuation allowance against all of our net deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance increased  in fiscal at september   net deferred tax assets of  were fully reserved by a valuation allowance 
accounts receivable valuation we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
at september   accounts receivable net of allowances for doubtful accounts amounted to  liquidity and capital resources at september   our primary sources of liquidity were cash of  and a  bank loan facility  which matures on june  cash and cash equivalents decreased  in fiscal during fiscal  line of credit borrowings began in the second quarter and continued through the majority of the fourth quarter

our bank loan facility  which is subject to availability advance formulas based on eligible accounts receivable  import letter of credit commitment balances and inventories  is currently being used to support import letters of credit issued to our offshore manufacturers  which at september  amounted to  compared to  at september  at september   approximately  net of the outstanding letters of credit was available to borrow under the advance formulas 
the increase in outstanding letters of credit is primarily due to new our product introductions of the ipump  unity and smd products  and for european orders requiring lead free 
table of contents unity receivers 
we have orders in our september   backlog scheduled to ship throughout fiscal for approximately  or of the outstanding letters of credit balances 
in fiscal  we expect to book and ship orders for the remainder of the outstanding balances 
currently our bank allows of the value of letters of credit as collateral while reducing borrowing availability by the full amount of outstanding letter of credit balances 
as a result  we may at various times during fiscal require overadvances to the bank s collateral formula until the letter of credit inventory commitments convert to receivables  against which the bank will allow as available collateral 
there is no assurance the bank will grant overadvances in sufficient amounts and for the duration of time required to support operations until the inventory is shipped 
as a result we may need to obtain additional sources of financing 
no assurances may be given that additional sources of capital  if needed  would be available 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we began to utilize borrowings on the line of credit for payments against outstanding letters of credit and to support operations 
in addition  at september   we had land and buildings and improvements with a cost basis of  which had no mortgage balances outstanding 
land and buildings are not currently used in the existing loan facility s availability advance formulas  however  we believe these assets could be used to support additional borrowing capacities either with our existing bank or from other lenders

cash used by financing activities for loan facility fees was  in fiscal  while financing activities provided cash of  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
net accounts receivable decreased  to  at september   from  at september   compared to  at september  the decrease in fiscal was mainly due to lower revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to the same period in fiscal the decrease in fiscal was due to lower average days outstanding of fiscal receivables  primarily due to a prepayment on a large order from one customer  compared to the same period of fiscal the allowance for doubtful accounts was  at september    at september  and  at september  write offs were  in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal recoveries in fiscal were  and  in fiscal increases to the allowance and charges to general and administrative expense were  in fiscal and in fiscal in fiscal  reductions in the allowance for doubtful accounts provided a benefit of customer deposits decreased  to  at september   from  at september   primarily due to shipments of customer orders and a decrease in bookings requiring deposits in fiscal customer deposits vary with the timing and terms of customer bookings

outlook issues and uncertainties see also risk factors the market for our products is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and frequent product introductions 
product introductions are generally characterized by increased functionality and better quality  sometimes at reduced prices 
the introduction of products embodying new technology may render existing products obsolete and unmarketable  or marketable at substantially reduced prices 
our ability to successfully develop and introduce on a timely basis new and enhanced products that embody new technology  and achieve levels of functionality and price acceptable to the market  will be a significant factor in our ability to grow and remain competitive 
if we are unable  for technological or other reasons  to develop competitive products in a timely manner in response to changes in the industry  our business and operating results will be materially and adversely affected 
wci competes with companies that have substantially greater resources and a larger number of products  as well as with small specialized companies 
through relationships with technology partners and original equipment manufacturer oem suppliers  we are positioned to provide end to end solutions to our customers 
competition in the market for our broadcast television electronics products  including digital video equipment  is driven by timeliness  performance and price 
our broadcast digital video products in production are competitively priced  with unique  desirable features 
the compel network control system meets customer needs by providing regionalization of receiver control and spot advertisement 
due to the large number of potential end users  both small and large competitors continue to emerge 
we believe we are positioned to capitalize on the market trends in this business through careful development of products and market strategies 
in the cable television market we believe that the competitive position for many of our products is strong 
however  the unity product family competes with significant and established firms 
other products for cable television include proprietary cueing and network control devices 
competition for radio network products  including our digital audio products  is very aggressive and pricing is very competitive 
we believe that success in all of our markets will depend on aggressive 
table of contents marketing and product development 
there may be fluctuations in our revenues and operating results from quarter to quarter due to several factors  including the timing of significant orders from customers and the timing of new product introductions by us 
we have invested a significant amount of financial resources to acquire certain raw materials  to incur direct labor and to contract to have specific outplant procedures performed on inventory in process 
we purchased this inventory based upon previously known backlog and anticipated future sales  given existing knowledge of the marketplace 
our inventory reserve of  at september   is to provide for items that are potentially slow moving  excess or obsolete 
changes in market conditions  lower than expected customer demand and rapidly changing technology could result in additional obsolete and slow moving inventory that is unsaleable or saleable at reduced prices 
no estimate can be made of a range of amounts of loss from obsolescence that might occur should our sales efforts not be successful 
sales to a relatively small number of major customers have typically comprised a majority of our revenues  and that trend is expected to continue throughout fiscal and beyond
