avian influenza bird flu  a highly contagious disease that affects poultry  has recently spread throughout asia to europe at an unprecedented rate 
bird flu is not a new disease  and while it does not currently exist in the us  it has occurred in this country twice within the past years

the company s new financing is expected to replace its current senior credit agreement and senior subordinated notes 
the company s management believes that cash flows from operating activities consistent with the current level in fiscal  unrestricted cash  and funds available under the new financing that is currently being negotiated should be sufficient to meet the company s working capital needs and capital expenditures  including the acquisition of nbp  through the term of the new facility 
numerous factors could have consequences to the company that cannot be known at this time  such as any additional occurrence of bse in the us or elsewhere  further reduced raw material volumes available to the company due to weak margins in the meat processing industry or otherwise  unforeseen new governmental regulations affecting the rendering industry including new or modified bse regulations  and or unfavorable export markets 
these factors  coupled with high prices for natural gas and diesel fuel  among others  could either positively or negatively impact the company s results of operations in and thereafter 
the company cannot provide assurance that the cash flows from operating activities generated in fiscal are indicative of the future cash flows from operating activities which will be generated by the company s operations 
the company reviews the appropriate use of unrestricted cash periodically 
although no decision has been made as to non ordinary course cash usages at this time  potential usages could include opportunistic capital expenditures and or acquisitions  investments in response to governmental regulations relating to bse  unforeseen problems relating to the integration of nbp after closing  and paying dividends or repurchasing stock  subject to limitations under the new facility  as well as suitable cash conservation to withstand adverse commodity cycles 
the current economic environment in the company s markets has the potential to adversely impact its liquidity in a variety of ways  including through reduced sales  potential inventory buildup or higher operating costs 
the principal products that the company sells are commodities  the prices of which are quoted on established commodity markets and are subject to volatile changes 
a decline in these prices has the potential to adversely impact the company s liquidity 
a further disruption in international sales  a decline in commodities prices  a further decline in raw material volume  or further increases in energy prices resulting from the recent war with iraq and the subsequent political instability and uncertainty  all have the potential to adversely impact the company s liquidity 
there can be no assurance that a decline in commodities prices  a rise in energy prices  a slowdown in the us or international economy  or other factors  including political instability in the middle east or elsewhere and the macroeconomic effects of those events  will not cause the company to fail to meet management s expectations or otherwise result in liquidity concerns

critical accounting policies the company follows certain significant accounting policies when preparing its consolidated financial statements 
a complete summary of these policies is included in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
certain of the policies require management to make significant and subjective estimates or assumptions which may deviate from actual results 
in particular  management makes estimates regarding estimates of bad debt expense  valuation of inventories  estimates of useful life of long lived assets related to depreciation and amortization expense  estimates regarding fair value of the company s reporting units and future cash flows with respect to assessing potential impairment of both long lived assets and goodwill  estimates of liability with respect to medical insurance liability  self insurance  environmental and litigation reserves  pension liability  estimates of income tax expense  and estimates of pro forma expense related to stock options granted

 accounting for contingencies  the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from customers non payment of trade accounts receivable owed to the company 
these trade receivables arise in the ordinary course of business from sales of raw material  finished product or services to the company s customers 
the estimate of allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon the company s bad debt experience  prevailing market conditions  aging of trade accounts receivable  and interest rates  among other factors 
if the financial condition of the company s customers deteriorates  resulting in the customer s inability to pay the company s receivable as it comes due  additional allowance for doubtful accounts may be required

page inventories the company s inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
finished product manufacturing cost is calculated using the first in  first out fifo method  based upon the company s raw material costs  collection and factory production operating expenses  and depreciation expense on collection and factory assets 
market values of inventory are estimated at each plant location  based upon either the backlog of unfilled sales orders at the balance sheet date  or for unsold inventory  upon regional finished product prices quoted in the jacobsen index at the balance sheet date 
estimates of market value  based upon the backlog of unfilled sales orders or upon the jacobsen index  assume that the inventory held by the company at the balance sheet date will be sold at the estimated market finished product sales price  subsequent to the balance sheet date 
actual sales prices received on future sales of inventory held at the end of a period may vary from either the backlog unfilled sales order price or the jacobsen index quotation at the balance sheet date 
such variances could cause actual sales prices realized on future sales of inventory to be different than the estimate of market value of inventory at the end of the period 
inventories were approximately million and million at december  and january   respectively 
long lived assets depreciation and amortization expense and valuation the company s property  plant and equipment are recorded at cost when acquired 
depreciation expense is computed on property  plant and equipment based upon a straight line method over the estimated useful life of the assets  which is based upon a standard classification of the asset group 
buildings and improvements are depreciated over a useful life of to years  machinery and equipment are depreciated over a useful life of to years and vehicles are depreciated over a life of to years 
these useful life estimates have been developed based upon the company s historical experience of asset life utility  and whether the asset is new or used when placed in service 
the actual life and utility of the asset may vary from this estimated life 
useful lives of the assets may be modified from time to time when the future utility or life of the asset is deemed to change from that originally estimated when the asset was placed in service 
depreciation expense was approximately million  million and million in fiscal years ending december   january  and january   respectively 
the company s intangible assets  including routes  raw material supply agreements and non compete agreements are recorded at fair value when acquired 
amortization expense is computed on these intangible assets based upon a straight line method over the estimated useful life of the assets  which is based upon a standard classification of the asset group 
collection routes are amortized over a useful life of to years  and raw material supply agreements and non compete agreements are amortized over a useful life of to years 
the actual economic life and utility of the asset may vary from this estimated life 
useful lives of the assets may be modified from time to time when the future utility or life of the asset is deemed to change from that originally estimated when the asset was placed in service 
amortization expense was approximately million  million and million in fiscal years ending december   january  and january   respectively 
the company reviews the carrying value of long lived assets for impairment at the end of each fiscal year and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset  or related asset group  may not be recoverable from estimated future undiscounted cash flows 
for purposes of calculating impairment on long lived operating assets  the company estimates fair value of its long lived assets at each plant based upon future undiscounted net cash flows from use of those assets 
in calculating such estimates  actual historical operating results and anticipated future economic factors  such as future business volume  future finished product prices  and future operating costs and expense are evaluated and estimated as a component of the calculation of future undiscounted cash flows for each operating plant location 
the estimates of fair value of the reporting units and of future undiscounted net cash flows from operation of these assets could change if actual volumes  prices  costs or expenses vary from these estimates 
a future reduction of earnings in the company s plants could result in an impairment charge because the estimate of fair value would be negatively impacted by a reduction of earnings 
the company reviews the carrying value of assets held for sale on a regular basis for indications of impairment 
impairment is indicated whenever the carrying value of the asset exceeds estimated fair value less costs to sell 
for purposes of calculating impairment on assets held for sale  the company utilizes estimated sales value of the assets as an estimate of fair value 
the estimates of fair value of the assets held for sale could change if the actual sales value realized  or realizable  varies from the estimated sale value 
page the net book value of property  plant and equipment was approximately million and million at december  and january   respectively 
the net book value of intangible assets was approximately million and million at december  and january   respectively 
goodwill valuation the company reviews the carrying value of goodwill on a regular basis  including at the end of each fiscal year  for indications of impairment at each plant location which has recorded goodwill as an asset

for purposes of evaluating impairment of goodwill  the company estimates fair value of plant assets at each plant  based upon future discounted net cash flows from use of those assets 
in calculating such estimates  actual historical operating results and anticipated future economic factors  such as future business volume  future finished product prices  and future operating costs and expenses are evaluated and estimated as a component of the calculation of future discounted cash flows for each operating plant location with recorded goodwill 
the estimates of fair value of assets at these plant locations and of future discounted net cash flows from operation of these assets could change if actual volumes  prices  costs or expenses vary from these estimates 
a future reduction of earnings in the plants with recorded goodwill could result in an impairment charge because the estimate of fair value would be negatively impacted by a reduction of earnings at those plants

if actual future medical claims by employees vary significantly from historical spending or if the actual timeliness of submission of those claims by medical care providers changes  the actual medical claims may vary from the estimated liability 
the actual cost of providing medical care to severely ill employees and dependents may vary from estimates if the patient either recovers or dies 
accrued medical claims liability included in accrued expenses was approximately million and million at december  and january   respectively 
self insurance  environmental and legal reserves the company s workers compensation  auto  and general liability policies contain significant deductibles or self insured retentions

in developing estimates for self insured losses  the company utilizes its staff  a third party actuary  and outside counsel as sources of information and judgment as to the expected undiscounted future costs of the claims 
the company accrues reserves related to environmental and litigation matters based on estimated undiscounted future costs 
with respect to the company s self insurance  environmental and litigation reserves  estimates of reserve liability could change if future events are different than those included in the estimates of the actuary  consultants and management of the company

pension liability the company provides retirement benefits to employees under separate final pay noncontributory pension plans for salaried and hourly employees excluding those employees covered by a union sponsored plan  who meet service and age requirements 
benefits are based principally on length of service and earnings patterns during the five years preceding retirement 
pension expense and pension liability recorded by the company is based upon an annual actuarial estimate provided by a third party administrator 
factors included in estimates of current year page pension expense and pension liability at the balance sheet date include estimated future service period of employees  estimated future pay of employees  estimated future retirement ages of employees  and the projected time period of pension benefit payments 
two of the most significant assumptions used to calculate future pension obligations are the discount rate applied to pension liability and the expected rate of return on pension plan assets 
these assumptions and estimates are subject to the risk of change over time  and each factor has inherent uncertainties which neither the actuary nor the company is able to control or to predict with certainty 
the discount rate applied to the company s pension liability is the interest rate used to calculate the present value of the pension benefit obligation 
the discount rate is based on the yield of long term corporate fixed income securities at the measurement date of october in the year of calculation 
the company considered the citigroup pension discount liability index as of october  as well as the lehman a aa aaa indices which combined to average as of october  with estimated liability payment streams under the plans being to years out and no bonds available with maturity dates that far into the future  but with the yield curve historically flat  the company believes it is appropriate to reference from the citigroup and lehman bond rates 
the weighted average discount rate was and at october in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the net periodic benefit cost for fiscal would increase by approximately million if the discount rate was lower at 
the net periodic benefit cost for fiscal would decrease by approximately million if the discount rate was higher at 
the expected rate of return on the company s pension plan assets is the interest rate used to calculate future returns on investment of the plan assets 
the expected return on plan assets is a long term assumption whose accuracy can only be assessed over a long period of time 
the weighted average expected return on pension plan assets was for both fiscal and fiscal the company has recorded a minimum pension liability of approximately million and million at december  and january   respectively 
the company s net pension cost was approximately million  million and million for the fiscal years ending december   january  and january   respectively 
income taxes in calculating net income  the company includes estimates in the calculation of tax expense  the resulting tax liability  and in future utilization of deferred tax assets which arise from temporary timing differences between financial statement presentation and tax recognition of revenue and expense 
the company s deferred tax assets include a net operating loss carry forward which is limited to approximately million per year in future utilization due to the change in majority control  resulting from the may recapitalization of the company 
as a result of these matters  the estimate of future utilization of deferred tax assets relies upon the forecast of future reversal of the company s deferred tax liabilities  which provide some evidence of the ability of the company to utilize deferred tax assets in future years 
valuation allowances for deferred tax assets are recorded when it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will expire before they are utilized and the tax benefit is realized 
based upon the company s evaluation of these matters  a significant portion of the company s net operating loss carry forwards will expire unused 
the valuation allowance established to provide a reserve against these deferred tax assets was approximately million and million at december  and january   respectively
