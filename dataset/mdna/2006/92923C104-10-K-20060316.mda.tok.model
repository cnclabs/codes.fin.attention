item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition traditional homebuilding 
because the construction cycle for our traditional homes is generally less than one year  we recognize homebuilding revenues when homes close and title to and possession of the property is formally transferred to the buyer 
the majority of our homebuilding revenues are received in cash within one or two days subsequent to closing 
we include amounts in transit from title companies at the end of each reporting period in cash and cash equivalents 
revenue recognition tower homebuilding 
revenue recognition for multi family condominiums tower residences under construction commences and continues to be recognized on the percentage of completion method where the planned construction period is greater than one year and the requirements of sfas  as described below  are met 
revenue is recorded as a portion of the value of non cancelable tower unit contracts when construction is beyond a preliminary stage  the buyer is committed to the extent of being unable to require a full refund of its deposits except for non delivery of the residence  a substantial percentage of residences in the tower are under non cancelable contracts  collectibility of sales prices are reasonably assured and costs can be reasonably estimated 
revenue is recognized in proportion to the percentage of total costs incurred in relation to estimated total costs 
we collect deposits at a level that we believe is significant enough to ensure the collectibility of the full purchase price when the units are delivered at their completion 
we have demonstrated a very high level of success in collecting the full purchase price of tower units upon building completion 
over our previous year history of building residential towers  our default rate has been approximately of total sold tower units 
the percentage of completion method is applied since we meet applicable requirements under sfas actual revenues and costs to complete building construction in the future could differ from our current estimates 
if our estimates of tower revenues and development costs are significantly different from actual amounts  then our revenues  related cumulative profits and costs of sales may be revised in the period that estimates change 
contracts receivable 
amounts due under tower sales contracts  to the extent recognized as revenue under the percentage of completion method  are recorded as contracts receivable 
we review the collectibility of contracts receivable on a quarterly basis and provide for estimated losses due to potential customer defaults 
historically  approximately of customers who had noncancelable contracts defaulted on the obligation to close the purchase of the tower unit 
actual contract defaults may differ from our current estimates 
revenue recognition amenity membership and operations 
revenues from amenity operations include the sale of equity memberships and marina slips  non equity memberships  billed membership dues and fees for services provided 
equity membership and marina slip sales are recognized at the time of closing 
equity membership sales and the related cost of sales are initially recorded under the cost recovery method 
revenue recognition for each equity club program is reevaluated on a periodic basis based upon changes in circumstances 

table of contents if we can demonstrate that it is likely to recover proceeds in excess of remaining carrying value  the full accrual method is then applied 
non equity membership initiation fees represent initial payments for rights to use the amenity facilities 
the non equity membership initiation fees are deferred and amortized to amenity membership revenues over years which represents the estimated average depreciable life of the amenity facilities 
dues are billed on an annual basis in advance and are recorded as deferred revenue and then recognized as revenue ratably over the term of the membership year 
revenues for services are recorded when the service is provided 
real estate inventories and cost of sales 
in accordance with sfas  accounting for costs and initial rental operations for real estate projects  real estate inventories including land  common development costs  amenities to be sold or transferred in connection with the sale of individual units and estimates for costs to complete  are allocated to each parcel or lot based on the estimated relative sales value of each parcel or lot  as compared to the sales value of the total project  while site specific development costs are allocated directly to the benefited land 
for amenities to be sold separately or retained by us  capitalized costs in excess of its estimated fair value as of the substantial completion date are allocated as common costs to each parcel or lot benefited based on estimated relative sales value 
we use the specific identification method for the purpose of accumulating costs associated with home and tower construction 
we allocate and relieve all applicable land acquisition  land development and related costs both incurred and estimated to be incurred to cost of sales for homes closed based upon the relative sales values of homes expected to be closed in each project 
when a home is closed  we usually have not yet paid all incurred costs necessary to complete the home 
each month  we record as a liability and as a charge to cost of sales the amount we estimate to have incurred related to completed homes that have been closed 
actual costs to complete in the future could differ from our current estimated amounts 
warranty costs 
we establish warranty reserves for traditional and tower residences at the time we recognize revenue by charging cost of sales and crediting a warranty liability 
the warranty reserves are estimated by management to be adequate to cover expected warranty related costs for materials and labor required under our warranty obligation periods 
we generally provide our single and multi family home buyers with a one to three year limited warranty  respectively  for all material and labor and a ten year warranty for certain structural defects 
we generally provide our tower home buyers a three year warranty for the unit and common elements of the tower 
our warranty cost accruals are based upon our historical warranty cost experience in each market in which we operate and adjust the accruals as appropriate to reflect qualitative risks associated with the type of homes we build and the geographic areas in which we build them 
actual future warranty costs could differ from our currently estimated amounts 
capitalized interest and real estate taxes 
we capitalize interest  up to an amount not to exceed total interest incurred  and real estate taxes on parcels  lots  homes  towers and amenity facilities the projects while under active development 
the capitalization period ends when the asset is substantially complete and ready for its intended use or sale 
the amount of interest capitalized in an accounting period is determined by applying the company s weighted average annualized interest rate to the amount of accumulated expenditures related to the projects under development during the period 
for homebuilding projects  land sales and amenities conveyed through equity membership sales  capitalized interest and real estate taxes are apportioned on relative sales value and relieved to cost of sales  respectively  with each home closing  land sale or membership sold 
for tower buildings  capitalized interest and real estate taxes are amortized to cost of sales under the percentage of completion method 
for owned and operated assets  capitalized interest and real estate taxes are included in the base cost of the assets and depreciated 
if the various underlying estimates related to interest capitalization and amortization are revised  then more or less interest and real estate taxes would be capitalized and or allocated and relieved to cost of sales 
community development district obligations 
in connection with certain development activities  bond financing is utilized in many of our communities to construct on site and off site infrastructure improvements 
some bonds are repaid directly by us while other bonds only require us to pay non ad valorem assessments 
table of contents related to lots not yet delivered to residents 
we also guarantee district shortfalls under certain bond debt service agreements 
in accordance with eitf  accounting for special assessments and tax increment financing entities  we annually estimate the amount of bond obligations that we may be required to fund in the future 
if our estimates of the amount of bond obligations that we may be required to fund are significantly different from actual amounts funded  our real estate inventories and costs of sales may be revised on a prospective basis 
impairment of long lived assets held for use and long lived assets to be disposed of 
real estate inventories considered held for sale including land intended for sale and completed tower residences and homes are carried at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell 
property and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation and depreciated on the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of property and equipment and real estate inventories considered held and used  including land and land improvements  investments in amenities and tower residences and homes under development may not be recoverable  we compare the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted expected future cash flows 
if this comparison indicates that the asset is impaired  the amount of the impairment is calculated using discounted expected future cash flows 
if our estimate of the future cash flows is significantly different from actual cash flows  we may prematurely impair the value of the asset  we may underestimate the value of the calculated impairment or we may fail to record impairment 
goodwill 
goodwill is not subject to amortization and is tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the goodwill to its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
several factors are used to evaluate goodwill  including management s plans for future operations  recent operating results and estimated future revenues and costs 
due to the uncertainties associated with such estimates  our conclusion regarding goodwill impairment could change and result in future goodwill impairment 
litigation 
we are involved in litigation incidental to our business  the disposition of which is expected to have no material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our estimates and assumptions related to these proceedings  or due to the ultimate resolution of the litigation 
results of operations overview years ended december  dollars in thousands total revenues total gross margin a net income a our gross margin includes overhead expenses directly associated with each line of business

our principal business lines include single and multi family traditional homebuilding  mid and high rise tower homebuilding and real estate services 
in  approximately and of revenues and gross margin  respectively  were derived from our combined homebuilding operations 
during  we accomplished significant growth in revenues  earnings and shareholders equity  by capitalizing on our traditional and tower homebuilding expertise and continuing to expand our geographic footprint across the us east coast 
the year featured many accomplishments  including the successful integration of our recently acquired mid atlantic division as well as the release of our first tower outside the state of florida  which has exceeded our expectations 
while there is a general sentiment that housing demand 
table of contents has begun to soften in many markets  we believe that this is temporary and that the long term impacts of the aging baby boom generation demographics and the associated intergenerational transfer of wealth will drive growth in the homebuilding market over the next two decades in general  and more specifically  in our business  which serves this demographic sector with luxury primary  secondary and active adult homes 
for  total revenues and gross margin increased and  respectively 
the increase in revenues and gross margin was driven by the expansion of our traditional and tower homebuilding divisions 
the traditional homebuilding division benefited from the delivery of homes from our increased backlog  the continued contributions from the northeast us market which we entered in may and the acquisition in the mid atlantic us market of renaissance housing corporation in february during the year  the mid atlantic us operations combined with our northeast us operations  contributed million and million in revenues and gross margin  respectively 
the increase in tower revenues and gross margin was a result of an increase in the number of towers recognizing percentage of completion revenues compared to last year 
revenues and gross margin were also positively impacted by the sale of approximately acres of undeveloped land in jupiter  florida for million in may this transaction produced approximately million of gross margin 
net income increased as the result of our gross margin growth and our revised capitalized interest calculations  but was partially offset by an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses sg a  hurricane losses and expenses related to early repayment of debt 
effective april   we revised our calculations of capitalized interest with respect to our traditional homebuilding and tower inventories  as prescribed by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 capitalization of interest cost 
we now include the underlying developed land costs in our calculation of capitalized interest for tower residences under construction and include the underlying developed land costs and in process homebuilding costs in our calculation of capitalized interest for traditional homes under construction 
capitalization ceases upon substantial completion of each home or tower 
if we had applied the revised calculations of capitalized interest to the years ended and  our cost of sales for the traditional homebuilding segment would have increased by approximately million and million  respectively due to additional relief of capitalized interest  and our cost of sales for the tower homebuilding segment would have increased by approximately million and million  respectively due to additional relief of capitalized interest 
in addition  net interest expense for the years ended december  and would have decreased by approximately million and million  respectively 
the impact of the revision to consolidated net income for previously reported periods was immaterial 
on october   hurricane wilma disrupted business in a portion of our florida market  including the miami  fort lauderdale  west palm beach boca raton  marco island  naples and fort myers cape coral areas 
in some locations  wci s sales centers were closed for up to two weeks due to the lack of power and the gasoline shortages affecting the company s employees and customers 
once the sales centers reopened  the impact of the storm lingered as some buyers chose to delay their visits to florida while collier  dade  broward and palm beach counties were cleaned up 
many local residents who would have otherwise been shopping for a new home were focused on repairing damage to their homes in these markets through the end of the year 
as a result  traffic and orders subsequent to the storm have been weaker than expected throughout wci s florida communities  and in our prudential florida wci real estate brokerage business 
the disruption of the availability of certain types of subcontracted labor  materials and electrical power connections also had the effect of delaying closings in adjoining florida markets including tampa and sarasota 
we sustained damage to landscaping at our amenities facilities  properties under development  traditional homes under construction and certain towers 
we also experienced incremental costs resulting from storm preparation  cleanup and business interruption 
for the year ended  we recorded million in expenses relating to the damaged properties but have not recognized potential insurance recoveries due to their preliminary stage 
we are in process of documenting all estimated losses and preparing claims for submission to our insurance carriers relating to hurricane wilma  but final insurance recoveries cannot be determined until additional information is known 
the nature of the damage is likely to result in recovery of only a small portion of our expenses related to the damaged properties  however  no amount can be estimated at this time 
included in other income and expense are insurance recoveries  net of incremental costs  related to the hurricanes of approximately million

the increases in revenues and home deliveries were achieved in the florida market and from the growing contributions from the northeast us market which we entered in may and the acquisition in the mid atlantic us market of renaissance housing corporation in february the florida market contributed million to the increase in revenues and delivered an incremental homes 
the increases in florida revenues and home deliveries were due to construction delays caused by the hurricanes and permitting delays in late that pushed home deliveries into and the routine delivery of homes from our increased backlog 
the northeast us and mid atlantic us markets contributed million and million to the increase in revenues and an incremental and home deliveries  respectively 
revenues were also favorably impacted by the increase in the average selling price per home closed  resulting from closing a larger portion of homes in our higher priced communities 
in addition to a increase contributed by the florida market  the increase was positively impacted by the million average selling price per home closed achieved in the mid atlantic us market 
the northeast us market experienced a decrease in the average selling price per home closed primarily due to the change in mix of products sold 
lot revenues increased million due to the initial sales from one of our communities located in the west coast florida region and an increase in lot sales from an existing community located in the east coast florida region 
from time to time  we sell certain lots for custom homes directly to prospective residents or custom homebuilders as part of our strategy to serve a broad range of customers

table of contents contract values of new orders increased due in part to the units and million of new orders contributed by the mid atlantic us market and a increase in the average sales price 
net new orders for homes decreased units due to reduced sales in our florida communities of units offset by sales from the mid atlantic us market 
the unit decrease in new orders for homes in the florida market was primarily due to the company s decision to temporarily reduce product offerings in certain communities where strong demand and permitting delays have extended backlog into  reduced prospective buyer traffic attributed primarily to the effect of hurricane wilma in the fourth quarter of and the sell out of five communities offset by initial sales in one new community 
the increase in backlog contract values is related to a increase in the average sales price of homes under contract 
the decrease in backlog units can be attributed to decreased homebuilding sales noted above and  to a lesser extent  the unit and million decline in the northeast us market offset by units and million from mid atlantic us markets 
we employ a wide range of sales incentives to market our homes to prospective buyers 
these incentives are an important aspect of our sales and marketing of homes  and we may rely on them more heavily in promoting communities experiencing weaker demand or to promote the sale of completed unsold homes 
without the use of these marketing incentives  our ability to sell homes could be adversely impacted 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  the increase in revenues was primarily due to the million of revenue contributed by our northeast us operations  which were acquired in may  offset by a decrease in revenues of million in our florida markets 
we closed units during the year in our northeast us markets while  units were closed in our florida markets  compared to  closed last year in florida

the increase in the average selling price per home closed was positively impacted by the  average price achieved by our northeast us markets and the  contributed by the florida markets 
lot revenues decreased million due primarily to the near sell out in of lots in one of our communities located in the east coast florida region 
the decrease in the gross margin percentage was due to the amortization of the inventory step up associated with the acquisition of spectrum communities to reflect fair value at the time of purchase and a decline in gross margins from the florida markets 
gross margin percentages for the florida markets decreased to from primarily due to higher raw material and labor costs at one east coast florida community where home deliveries were delayed  the close out of a subdivision in one community located in the west coast florida region and above average incentives and discounts related to the sale and delivery of two luxury model homes 
due to permitting delays  the timeframe from initial customer contract to construction start to home delivery increased by up to as much as to months  thus sales prices were locked in over a year or longer before delivery and our actual costs were higher than previously estimated 
the hurricanes of the third quarter exacerbated the delays and cost increases  making the impact even greater 
other factors impacting gross margin were the million increase in warranty and construction overhead costs 
construction overhead costs increased primarily due to increased salaries and benefits

although absorption of homes priced in excess of million in certain second home luxury communities located in our florida markets continues to be slow  the overall increase in sales is believed to be attributable to increasing consumer confidence throughout our regions and the completion of the new amenity facilities in existing communities 
the increase in backlog contract values primarily reflects a increase in the backlog units and decrease in the average sales price of homes under contract to  in compared to  in the increase in backlog contract values and units is attributed to a rise in homebuilding sales combined with closing delays in the florida markets due to the hurricanes and  to a lesser extent  the acquisition of spectrum communities  which had units and million in backlog at december  tower homebuilding years ended december  dollars in thousands revenues gross margin gross margin percentage net new orders units contract values of new orders average selling price per new order as of december  cumulative contracts units cumulative contract values less cumulative revenues recognized backlog contract values towers under construction recognizing revenue during the year year ended december  compared to year ended december  tower revenues recognized using the percentage of completion method increased million offset by a million decrease in revenue from the sale of completed tower units 
the increase in revenues recognized from percentage of completion was related to the increase in the number of buildings under construction recognizing revenue and the progression of completion in towers that were under construction in the comparable periods 
revenue from the sale of completed tower units decreased due to the reduction in the number of completed tower units in inventory available for sale 
tower contract values  revenues and gross margin also benefited from the construction of our first tower in the northeast us market 
we began marketing the northeast us tower in early and successfully completed the contract conversion and began percentage of completion revenue recognition in the fourth quarter 
the decrease in gross margin percentage was due to a shift in the mix of towers under percentage of completion toward a greater proportion of moderately priced  lower margin towers  the reduced margin from the closings of completed tower units which averaged approximately gross margin in compared to in  revisions to our interest capitalization calculations for our tower inventories  which increased associated cost of sales and reduced gross margin percentage by approximately basis points and realization of million in construction and sales incentive savings on certain completed buildings in compared to the realization of million in

see note to our consolidated financial statements our cash requirements for are projected to increase as we continue to develop new communities and fund our growth 
we anticipate using our existing senior unsecured credit facility to fund land acquisitions  land development  homebuilding and amenity development 
our real estate development is dependent upon the availability of funds to finance current and future development 
we plan to continue growing and expect to fund this growth through the generation of cash flow from operations  from the availability of funds under our credit facilities  from new construction loans and from future debt and equity offerings 
we believe we have adequate resources and sufficient credit facilities to satisfy our current and reasonably anticipated future requirements to acquire capital assets and land  to develop land improvements and construction activities and to meet any other needs of our business  both on a short and long term basis 
if we do not have sufficient capital resources to fund our development and expansion  projects may be delayed  resulting in possible adverse effects on our results of operations 
no assurance can be given as to the terms  availability or cost of any future financing we may need 
if we are at any time unable to service our debt  refinancing or obtaining additional financing may be required and may not be available or available on terms acceptable to us 
furthermore  considerable economic and political uncertainties could have adverse effects on consumer buying behavior  construction costs  availability of labor and materials and other factors affecting us and the homebuilding industry generally 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements we selectively enter into business relationships through the form of partnerships and joint ventures with unrelated parties 
these partnerships and joint ventures are utilized to acquire  develop  market and operate homebuilding  amenities and real estate projects 
in connection with the operation of these partnerships and joint ventures  the partners may agree to make additional cash contributions to the partnerships pursuant to the partnership agreements 
we believe that future contributions  if required  will not have a significant impact on our liquidity or financial position 
if we fail to make required contributions  we may lose some or all of our interest in such partnerships or joint ventures 
at december   one of our unconsolidated joint ventures had obtained third party financing of million  of which million is outstanding 
under the terms of the agreement  we provide a joint and several guarantee for the amount outstanding 
although the majority of our unconsolidated partnership and joint ventures do not have outstanding debt  the partners may agree to incur debt to fund partnership and joint venture operations in the future 
in the normal course of business  we enter into contractual arrangements to acquire developed and undeveloped land parcels and lots 
as of december   our evaluation of our contractual arrangements to acquire land and lots did not indicate any material variable interests with vies and we did not have any material lot purchase arrangements in which we concluded that we were compelled to exercise the option 
as of december   we had land and lot option contracts aggregating million net of deposits  to acquire approximately  acres of land 
our contractual obligation with respect to the land and lot option contracts is limited to the forfeiture of the related non refundable deposits  any other payments which may be due to the landowner and other pre development costs  which totaled million at december  standby letters of credit and performance bonds  issued by third party entities  are used to guarantee our performance under various contracts  principally in connection with the development of our projects and land purchase obligations 
at december   we had approximately million in letters of credit outstanding 
performance bonds do not have stated expiration dates  rather  we are released from the bonds as the contractual performance is completed 
these bonds  which approximated million at december   are typically outstanding over a period of approximately one to five years 
inflation the homebuilding industry is affected by inflation as it relates to the cost to acquire land  land improvements  homebuilding raw materials and subcontractor labor 
the continued growth in the homebuilding and other construction related industries and increases in the cost of petroleum have resulted in increased costs to obtain certain building materials  including lumber  drywall  steel  concrete and asphalt 
we compete with other builders and real estate developers for raw materials and labor 
on certain occasions we have experienced vendors limiting the supply of raw materials which slows the land  home and tower development process and requires us to obtain raw materials from other vendors  typically at higher prices 
unless these increased costs are recovered through higher sales prices  our gross margins would be impacted 
because the sales prices of our homes in backlog are fixed at the time a buyer enters into a contract to acquire a home  any inflation in the costs of raw materials and labor costs greater than those anticipated may result in lower gross margins 
in general  if interest rates continue to increase  construction and financing costs could increase  which would result in lower future gross margins 
increases in home mortgage interest rates may make it more difficult for our customers to qualify for home mortgage loans  potentially decreasing home sales revenue 
forward looking statements over the past five years  our value of new orders has grown at an annualized rate of over 
coupled with previously reported inventory shortages brought on by permitting delays  the impact of hurricane wilma on our south florida traffic during the fourth quarter were major factors in our orders declining for the quarter and the year 

table of contents as we move into  we expect to see improvement to our recent florida traffic patterns and are optimistic that by the end of the year our annual order growth will return to historic levels of or more 
with to new traditional homebuilding communities and to new towers commencing sales during  we expect that the activity generated from these new projects will contribute to of our overall new orders for the year  but will have only a small impact on projected earnings 
much of this order growth is expected to occur in the second half of  when the majority of the new communities are expected to open and therefore will have a more significant impact on results 
from a revenue and earnings standpoint  we started with of our projected traditional homebuilding revenue and approximately of our projected tower revenue in backlog 
for  we plan to launch a new initiative focused on reducing our costs of production  centralizing our purchasing efforts for traditional homebuilding  and engaging in a more disciplined approach to managing our supply chain 
while there is a general sentiment that pricing power has begun to soften in many markets  we believe that this is temporary and that the long term impacts of the baby boom generation demographics and the associated intergenerational transfer of wealth will drive growth in the homebuilding market over the next two decades in general  and more specifically  in wci s business  which serves this demographic sector with luxury primary  secondary and active adult homes 
for  we expect traditional homebuilding gross margins to be in the to range 
gross margins for tower homebuilding are expected to range from to for we expect at least growth in real estate services gross margin in however  if overall residential demand declines in  it may be difficult to achieve these levels of growth 
assuming a favorable economic environment  including increased consumer confidence  a stronger stock market and moderately increasing interest rates  we expect to produce a or greater increase in earnings 
if buyer demand does not rebound from depressed levels in the fourth quarter of and the start of  interest rates increase significantly  the ability to obtain permits and approvals for land development are delayed or adverse legislation or regulations occur  then it may be difficult to achieve earnings growth

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we utilize fixed and variable rate debt 
changes in interest rates on fixed rate debt generally affects the fair market value of the instrument  but not our earnings or cash flow 
changes in interest rates on variable rate debt generally does not impact the fair market value of the instrument but does affect our earnings and cash flow 
we are exposed to market risk primarily due to fluctuations in interest rates on our variable rate debt 
we hedged a portion of our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into a interest swap agreement to lock in a fixed interest rate 
the swap agreement effectively fixes the variable rate cash flows on our million of variable rate senior term note and expires december the average pay rate of the swap agreement is
