item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations some information contained in the management s discussion and analysis is forward looking and involves risks and uncertainties 
the company operates in a cyclical industry and the results achieved this year are not necessarily an indication of future prospects for the company 
actual results in future years may differ materially 
potential risks and uncertainties include  among others  fluctuations in the volume and timing of product orders  changes in demand for the company s products  changes in technology  continued competitive pressures in the marketplace  outcomes of environmental contingencies  availability of raw materials  the ability to pass on raw material price increases  foreign currency fluctuations and general economic conditions 
overview the company produces and sells intermediate chemicals that are used in a wide variety of applications worldwide 
the overall business comprises three reportable segments surfactants surfactants  which accounted for percent of total net sales  are principal ingredients in consumer and industrial cleaning products such as detergents for washing clothes  dishes  carpets  floors and walls  as well as shampoos  lotions  fabric softeners  toothpastes and cosmetics 
other applications include germicidal quaternary compounds  lubricating ingredients  emulsifiers for spreading agricultural products  biodiesel and plastics and composites 
surfactants are manufactured at six north american sites five in the united states us and one in canada  three european sites and three latin american sites  including a site in brazil resulting from the january purchase of a subsidiary of a multinational cleaning products company 
polymers polymers  which accounted for percent of total net sales  include three primary product lines phthalic anhydride pa  polyurethane polyols and polyurethane systems 
pa is used in polyester alkyd resins and plasticizers for applications in construction materials and components of automotive  boating and other consumer products 
polyurethane polyols are used in the manufacture of laminate insulation board for the construction industry and are also sold to the appliance  coatings  adhesives  sealants and elastomers markets 
polyurethane systems provide thermal insulation and are sold to the construction  industrial and appliance markets 
in the us  polymer product lines are manufactured at one site 
since  the company also manufactures polyurethane polyols at its german facility 
in  the company entered into a joint venture agreement with sinopec  jinling petrochemical corporation in nanjing  china 
the joint venture was formed to manufacture the company s aromatic polyester polyols for china s domestic market 
in april  construction of a manufacturing facility in nanjing was completed and the joint venture commenced commercial operations 
specialty products specialty products  which accounted for three percent of total net sales  include flavors  emulsifiers and solubilizers used in the food and pharmaceutical industries 
specialty products are manufactured primarily at one us site 

table of contents because of the diverse markets it serves  the company has numerous competitors 
the company generally competes on price  product performance and the ability to meet specific needs of customers 
in some instances  particularly in the surfactants segment  the company competes with internal manufacturing capabilities of its customers 
this situation can lead to large period to period sales volume swings when such customers decide to manufacture in house product that the company once supplied 
in addition  the company s manufacturing costs are relatively fixed in nature 
as a result  gross profit defined as net sales less cost of sales is susceptible to disproportionate declines when volume decreases 
a number of the company s key raw materials and energy sources are commodities  principally petroleum based and plant based materials and natural gas used to power the company s manufacturing facilities  whose prices fluctuate due to weather  general economic demand and other unpredictable factors 
from through  raw material costs escalated due to instability in the middle east and to tight supplies resulting from greater material consumption by china and other parts of asia 
this trend is likely to continue in the near future  although the increases are not expected to be as steep as they have been in the recent past 
in addition to economic factors  the hurricanes in the gulf coast region also drove the costs for natural gas and gasoline higher  which led to higher manufacturing and freight expenses in the second half of although impossible to predict  the company believes the effects of the hurricanes on the costs of natural gas and gasoline will continue into the first quarter of increased raw material costs are passed on to customers as quickly as the marketplace allows  however  certain customers have arrangements with the company that allow for price changes only on a quarterly basis  and competitive pressures sometimes prevent cost increases from being passed on to customers  particularly in periods when there is excess industry capacity 
accordingly  some product lines or market segments may take time to recover raw material cost increases 
this was true in european markets during and the company effected numerous selling price increases throughout and  which have aided in stemming further profit margin erosion 
however  the current profit margin relative to net sales continues to lag behind historical levels  and the company anticipates further utility expense increases 
the rise in crude oil and gasoline prices has had a favorable effect on the company s biodiesel business 
the company produces soybean based biodiesel for blending with diesel fuel 
the demand for biodiesel fuel has increased steeply as a result of the high price of crude oil  the availability of government excise tax credits and growing interest in renewable energy sources and reduced dependence of foreign oil 
sales volume of the company s biodiesel product climbed percent between and  making this a more significant contributor to company profits in in  biodiesel accounted for six percent of domestic surfactants sales volume compared to two percent in the company is in the process of expanding its capacity to produce biodiesel to take further advantage of this growing market 
the company s operating expenses  administrative expenses in particular  are subject to period to period fluctuations due principally to the accounting for the company s deferred compensation plans and to obligations associated with environmental remediation and related legal liabilities 
the company operates in a setting of extensive local  state and federal regulations concerning the environment 
the company has been named as a prp to perform environmental remediation at the company s expense  at a number of geographic sites 
the company believes it has adequate reserves for all known environmental sites  but an adverse determination could result in a significant negative effect on the company s financial position  
table of contents results of operations and cash flows 
expenses related to legal and environmental matters declined million from to the company s deferred compensation plans expense increased million 
for further discussions of these matters  see the environmental and legal matters and critical accounting policies sections of this management discussion and analysis 
looking forward  will again be a challenging year 
raw material and energy costs are expected to remain volatile 
the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment  will also result in the recognition of additional expense see recent accounting pronouncements in note to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of the new requirement 
despite these hurdles  the company expects further full year earnings improvement in polymers sales volume is projected to improve as progresses 
the contribution from biodiesel should continue to grow as the capacity expansion is scheduled to be completed during the first quarter of the company is also undertaking cost containment initiatives  particularly with respect to employee benefit expenses  to aid in driving a higher return from its operations 
results of operations compared with summary net income for increased percent to million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share  for net income for before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle was million  or per diluted share 
operating income increased million  or percent  due primarily to improved profitability for the polymers and surfactants segments 
operating income benefited from higher selling prices  higher surfactants sales volumes  particularly for the company s foreign entities and domestic biodiesel product  and million of insurance settlement income  net of expenses  related to the fire at the united kingdom manufacturing site 
the foregoing benefits overcame utility expenses that increased million  or percent  and operating expenses that rose million  or six percent 
increased research and marketing expenses  partially offset by reduced administrative expenses  accounted for the higher operating expenses 
despite the million operating income improvement  pretax income grew just million due primarily to a decline in the results of the company s philippines joint venture 
a million after tax charge related to a change in accounting principle  necessitated by the adoption of a new accounting rule for conditional asset retirement obligations  also negatively affected net income 
below is a summary discussion of the major factors leading to the year to year changes in net sales  profits and expenses 
a detailed discussion of segment operating performance for follows the summary 
in  consolidated net sales exceeded the billion dollar level for the first time in company history 
net sales were billion in  a million  or percent  increase over net sales for increases in selling prices  due primarily to the pass through of higher raw material costs  a seven percent increase in sales volume and the favorable effects of foreign currency translations  accounted for approximately million  million and million  respectively  of the net sales increase 

table of contents gross profit for was up million  or percent  over gross profit for on a consolidated basis  gross profit as a percent of net sales declined to percent in from percent in  due primarily to cost increases outpacing selling price increases 
polymers and surfactants gross profits were up million and million  respectively  between years  and specialty products gross profit was down million 
selling price increases implemented to mitigate the negative effects of rising material costs that eroded the prior year s profit margin drove the polymers profit improvement 
the increase in surfactants gross profit resulted from higher sales volume  particularly for the company s foreign entities and domestic biodiesel product  and million in insurance proceeds  net of expenses  related to the september fire at the company s uk subsidiary 
higher utility and labor expenses tempered the gross profit improvement 
lower sales volume  especially for the food ingredients product line  led to the drop in specialty products gross profit 
operating income for increased million  or percent  over operating income reported in operating expenses increased million  or six percent  from year to year 
research and development expenses were up million  or percent  between years due to higher salaried payroll and outside contracting services 
marketing expenses were million  or percent  higher in than in  due primarily to higher salaried payroll expenses 
for both the research and marketing categories  salaried payroll expenses increased largely due to higher healthcare  pension  bonus and profit sharing costs  normal pay increases and  to a lesser extent  additional personnel 
administrative expenses were down million  or two percent  due largely to lower enterprise resource planning system implementation costs million and legal expenses million  partially offset by higher deferred compensation expense million and higher domestic healthcare  pension and bonus costs million in total 
interest expense increased million due primarily to a higher average level of debt and rising short term interest rates 
the company reported a million loss related to its philippines joint venture in compared to income of million in  a million unfavorable year to year change 
an unfavorable change in product mix coupled with lower sales volume at stepan philippines led to the loss 
a loss of sales of higher margin products was only partially replaced with sales of lower margin products 
the company expects some improvement in stepan philippines financial performance  as the joint venture aggressively pursues new business 
the joint venture is currently adding a plant to produce fabric softeners for the asian market  but significant contribution from the new facility isn t likely until other  net  which includes foreign exchange gains and losses and investment related income and expense  was million of income for compared to million of income for  an increase of million 
the company recorded foreign exchange gains of million for compared to foreign exchange losses of million for the effective tax rate was percent in compared to percent in the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to biodiesel tax credits that were enacted as part of the american jobs creation act of and the energy tax incentives act of the decrease was also due to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards in germany and credit carryforwards in mexico for which valuation allowances had previously been recorded 
this decrease was partially offset by a lower tax benefit realized on foreign joint venture equity 
table of contents income during the current year 
the year to year decline in the effective tax rate was somewhat mitigated by the non recurring tax benefit realized on a million charitable contribution of intellectual property 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation between the effective and statutory us federal income tax rates 
in  the company adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
fin no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  which led to a million after tax charge against income 
under the guidance of fin no 
 the company was required to record a liability for the eventual  future disposal of asbestos at the company s various locations  a liability previously unrecorded as the timing and method of the settlement of the obligation were considered conditional on future events 
the company has no plans to shut down any of its facilities 
in accordance with fin no 
 the charge for the cumulative effect of initially applying the interpretation was recorded as a change in accounting principle in the consolidated statements of income 
the effect on operating income was insignificant

higher operating expenses completely offset brazil s gross profit improvement 
gross profit for european operations increased million  or nine percent  from year to year 
excluding the insurance settlement income  gross profit for european operations fell million  or nine percent 
the european locations struggled during the first half of to recover the rising cost of raw materials from customers  as excess industry manufacturing capacity and vertically integrated competitors made it difficult for the company to recover all of the costs 
margin improvement began to occur in the last half of domestic gross profit for increased million  or four percent  over gross profit 
biodiesel gross profit was up significantly  due to strong demand in light of higher crude oil prices  and offset lower gross profit in the remainder of the domestic surfactants segment largely caused by higher natural gas costs

for foreign operations  approximately million of the year to year change resulted from the effects of foreign currency translation 
stepan brazil accounted for million of the foreign operations operating expense increase due to additional administrative and marketing costs needed to support the new business 
polymers polymers net sales for grew million  or percent  over net sales for higher selling prices  due primarily to the pass through of higher raw material costs  more than offset a nine percent drop in sales volume 
within the polymers segment  net sales for phthalic anhydride were up million  or percent  despite a four percent drop in sales volume  which was brought on  in part  by a planned manufacturing maintenance shutdown that ran longer than anticipated due to an electrical fire caused by faulty utility company equipment 
higher selling prices  due to the pass through of raw material cost increases to customers and to manufacturing fee increases implemented in and in the second quarter of  more than offset the effect of the lower sales volume 
despite a percent decline in sales volume  net sales for polyurethane polyols increased million  or percent 
higher selling prices led to the net sales improvement 
the average selling price for was up about percent over the average selling price for  reflecting selling price increases implemented in and in to mitigate the negative impact of rising raw material prices 
the sales volume decline reflected lower domestic and european sales volumes 
demand from the roofing insulation board market slowed considerably  particularly in the second half of the year  in response to high material costs  as end users delayed roofing repairs 
in addition  some market share was lost in europe due to high prices and increased competition 
net sales for polyurethane systems increased million  or percent  from year to year due to higher average selling prices 
sales volume remained unchanged from year to year 
the partial pass through of rising raw material costs to customers coupled with a more favorable product mix accounted for the higher average selling prices

below is a summary discussion of the major factors leading to the year to year changes in net sales  profits and expenses 
a detailed discussion of segment operating performance for follows the summary 
consolidated net sales increased million  or percent  to million for from million for approximately million of the increase was attributable to the favorable effects of foreign currency translation  due particularly to the strengthening euro  british pound sterling and canadian dollar against the us dollar 
all three segments reported year to year increases in net sales dollars 
surfactants segment net sales were up million  or percent  due to higher selling prices  favorable foreign currency translation and increased sales volumes 
net sales for the polymers segment increased million  or percent  due primarily to higher selling prices and higher sales volume 
the specialty products segment reported a million  or eight percent  increase in net sales due to higher sales volumes of food ingredient and pharmaceutical products 
operating income was up million  or percent  to million for from million for all three segments reported higher operating income in than in higher sales volumes across all segments and a favorable sales mix  particularly for domestic surfactants  contributed to the operating income improvement 
in addition  million of expenses for asset impairment losses did not recur in however  high raw material costs continued to temper profits  particularly in europe where competitive pressures made it difficult to recover escalating raw material costs through selling price increases 
operating expenses  which include marketing  administrative and research and development expenses  declined million  or two percent  to million for from million for most of the decline was in administrative expenses  which reflected a million decrease in deferred compensation expense and a million decrease in legal and environmental expenses 
in addition  operating expenses included million of separation costs related to a planned reduction in the us workforce 
the foregoing reductions were partially offset by the million unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation of the company s foreign subsidiary operating expenses 
interest expense declined million  or percent  between years due to a higher proportion of bank debt  which carries lower interest rates than the company s long term notes 
income from the company s philippine joint venture increased million between years 
income in the other  net  caption  which includes foreign exchange gains and losses and investment related income and expense  fell million from year to year 
the other  net result reflected million of foreign exchange losses in compared to million of exchange gains in in addition  results for included investment related income of million compared to investment related expense of million in 
table of contents the effective tax rate was percent for compared to percent for the higher effective tax rate was primarily attributable to factors that lowered the effective rate and did not reoccur 
in  the tax benefit realized on foreign joint venture equity income and federal and state tax credits increased as a percentage of consolidated income due to the decline in domestic operating results in that year 
in  the rate increased as a result of tax provided on a million dividend received from the company s philippine joint venture  which was more than offset by a tax benefit realized on a million charitable contribution of intellectual property during segment results dollars in thousands surfactants polymers specialty products segment results corporate total for the year ended december  net sales operating income for the year ended december  net sales operating income for  corporate expense allocations to the segments were increased for corporate supply chain costs 
surfactants surfactants net sales for increased million  or percent  over net sales for approximately million of the increase was attributable to the favorable effects of foreign currency translation  due particularly to the strengthening euro  british pound sterling and canadian dollar against the us dollar 
excluding the effects of foreign currency translation  surfactants net sales increased million or percent 
sales volume was up three percent from year to year 
domestic net sales increased million  or percent  on sales volume that increased one percent 
higher selling prices  due primarily to three price increases to partially pass rising raw material prices to customers  accounted for approximately million of the domestic net sales gain 
the first half decline in domestic sales volume that resulted from the loss of business from two large customers who moved previously outsourced production into internal production facilities was offset by the culmination of small to moderate sales volume gains for numerous company product lines 
the mix of sales has shifted somewhat as the sales volume gained tended to have higher unit selling prices than the sales volume lost 
excluding the effects of foreign currency translation  net sales for foreign operations increased million  or percent  on a seven percent volume increase 
the company s mexican and european operations accounted for most of the improvement in foreign operations net sales  reporting increases of million and million  respectively 
sales volume for mexican operations increased percent due to an increase in fabric softener sales volume 
sales volume for european operations increased six percent between years 

table of contents surfactants operating income for increased million  or two percent  over operating income reported for excluding the effects of currency translation  surfactants operating income increased million from year to year 
domestic operations operating income improved million  or percent  between years 
a more favorable mix of sales  along with the modest sales volume gain  accounted for about half of the domestic operating income growth 
also factoring into the year over year operating income improvement were million in expenses for impairment losses that did not recur in the impairment losses were recognized for equipment used in the manufacture of high viscosity paste at the company s millsdale joliet  illinois  plant 
this equipment represented a small portion of the plant s manufacturing capacity 
higher raw material costs  due to short supplies and high crude oil prices  dampened the year s operating income 
operating income for foreign operations fell million from year to year 
european operations reported an operating loss of million in  a drop of million from operating income of million  as higher raw material costs more than offset the effect of higher sales volume 
due to excess industry manufacturing capacity and vertically integrated competitors  attempts to raise selling prices in europe have not been successful in recovering all of the rapidly escalating raw material cost increases  particularly for the united kingdom subsidiary 
in the fourth quarter of  the company s primary united kingdom competitor announced plans to shut down its surfactant plant 
operating income for the company s mexico subsidiary improved million on the strength of the aforementioned sales volume increase 
polymers polymers net sales increased million  or percent  from year to year 
higher selling prices  due primarily to partially passing raw material cost increases to customers  a percent increase in sales volume  and million of favorable foreign currency translation on european sales all led to the increase in net sales 
the higher selling prices accounted for approximately million of the year to year net sales improvement 
excluding the effect of foreign currency translation  polyurethane polyols net sales increased million  or percent  on sales volume that grew percent due primarily to an improved u 
s 
economy and to an increased share of the growing european laminate board market 
higher selling prices also contributed as the company benefited from three selling price increases  which passed a portion of raw material cost increases on to customers 
pa s net sales were up million  or percent  due to higher selling prices that resulted primarily from passing raw material cost increases on to customers and  to a lesser extent  from increasing manufacturing fees to merchant market customers twice in also contributing was sales volume that improved percent due largely to an improved economy 
sales volumes improved for all major customers

table of contents polyurethane polyol plant  which commenced operations in july prior to july  the company outsourced most of its production of polyurethane polyols for the european market 
rising diethylene glycol and orthoxylene costs partially offset the effect of increased sales volume  particularly in the first half of the selling price increases that were attained in the second  third and fourth quarters minimized the effect of rising raw material costs in the second half of the year 
gross profit for pa increased million  or percent  due primarily to higher sales volume 
the manufacturing fee increases discussed above also contributed to the increase 
higher raw material costs somewhat tempered the year to year gross profit improvement 
gross profit for polyurethane systems declined million  or two percent  despite higher sales volume 
a change in sales mix coupled with higher raw material costs offset the effect of greater sales volume 
polymer operating expenses for were million  or eight percent  higher than operating expenses for domestic research expenses increased million due to an increased allocation of resources required to support the business

environmental and legal matters the company s operations are subject to extensive local  state and federal regulations 
although the company s environmental policies and practices are designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations  future developments and increasingly stringent environmental regulation could require the company to make additional unforeseen environmental expenditures 
the company will continue to invest in the equipment and facilities necessary to comply with existing and future regulations 
during  the company s expenditures for capital projects related to the environment were million 
these projects are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives  which is typically years 
recurring costs associated with the operation and maintenance of facilities for waste treatment and disposal and managing environmental compliance in ongoing operations at our manufacturing locations were approximately million for  million for and million for while difficult to project  it is not anticipated that these recurring expenses will increase significantly in the future 
over the years  the company has received requests for information related to or has been named by the government as a potentially responsible party at waste disposal sites where cleanup costs have been or may be incurred under cercla and similar state statutes 
in addition  damages are being claimed against the company in general liability actions for alleged personal injury or property damage in the case of some disposal and plant sites

it is the 
table of contents company s accounting policy to record liabilities when environmental assessments and or remedial efforts are probable and the cost or range of possible costs can be reasonably estimated 
when no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount  the minimum is accrued

after partial remediation payments at certain sites  the company has estimated a range of possible environmental and legal losses from million to million at december   compared to million to million at december  at december  the company s accrued liability for such losses  which represents the company s best estimate within the estimated range of possible environmental and legal losses  was million compared to million at december  during  non capital cash outlays related to legal and environmental matters approximated million compared to million expended in for certain sites  estimates cannot be made of the total costs of compliance or the company s share of such costs  accordingly  the company is unable to predict the effect thereof on future results of operations 
in the event of one or more adverse determinations in any annual or interim period  the impact on the company s financial position  cash flows or results of operations for those periods could be material

critical accounting policies we prepare our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america generally accepted accounting principles 
preparing our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the following is a summary of the accounting policies the company believes are the most important to aid in understanding its financial results 
deferred compensation the company maintains deferred compensation plans 
these plans allow management to defer receipt of its bonuses and directors to defer receipt of director fees until retirement or departure from the company 
the company funds its obligations associated with these plans by purchasing investment assets that match the investment choices a limited selection of mutual funds or company common stock made by the plan participants 
the company maintains at least enough company common stock in treasury to cover the equivalent number of common 
table of contents stock shares resulting from participants electing the company common stock option  which periodically requires the company to purchase its common shares from the open market 
the plans allow for the compensation being deferred to grow or decline based on the results of investment options chosen by the participants 
ultimately  upon retirement or departure from the company  participants receive the cash equivalent value of the investment choices they have made as of the date of plan distribution 
as a result  any appreciation in the value of stepan company common stock or the mutual fund options under the plan result is additional compensation expense to the company 
conversely  declines in the market price of stepan company stock or the value of the mutual funds results in a reduction of compensation expense since such declines reduce the cash obligation of the company as of the date of the financial statements 
it is these market price movements that result in the significant period to period fluctuations that impact the company s consolidated statements of income 
at december   the company s deferred compensation liability was million  of which approximately percent represents deferred compensation tied to the performance of the company s common stock and the remainder is tied to the mutual fund investment choices 
a increase in the market price of the company s common stock will result in approximately million of additional compensation expense 
similarly  a reduction in the market price of the common stock will reduce compensation expense by a like amount 
the expense or income associated with the mutual fund component will fluctuate generally in line with the overall percentage increase or decrease of the us stock markets 
the mutual fund assets are recorded on the company s balance sheet at cost when acquired and adjusted to their market values at the end of each reporting period 
while these market value adjustments affect the income statement due to their impact on the company s ultimate cash liability  there is not an offsetting income statement impact from fluctuation in the asset value  as generally accepted accounting principles require unrealized gains and losses on investments in marketable securities be recorded as a direct adjustment to shareholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
dividends and capital gains received from the mutual funds  as well as impairment losses and realized gains and losses from sales of mutual fund shares  are recognized as investment income loss under the other  net caption of the consolidated statements of income 
because the company s common stock is held as treasury stock  no further adjustments are made to equity as a result of market price movements in the stock 
environmental liabilities it is the company s accounting policy to record environmental liabilities when environmental assessments and or remedial efforts are probable and the cost or range of possible costs can be reasonably estimated 
when no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount  the minimum is accrued 
some of the factors on which the company bases its estimates include information provided by feasibility studies  potentially responsible party negotiations and the development of remedial action plans 
estimates for environmental liabilities are subject to significant fluctuations as new facts emerge related to the various sites where the company is exposed to liability for the remediation of environmental contamination 
see the environmental and legal matters section of this management s discussion and analysis for discussion of the company s reserves and range of loss estimates

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk because the company operates in the global marketplace  its cash flows and operating results are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations 
the company manufactures and sells products in many foreign locations and  therefore  believes its currency exchange risk is well diversified 
except as noted below  substantially all the company s foreign subsidiaries financial instruments are denominated in their respective functional currencies 
as such  exposure to exchange rate risk on foreign currency financial instruments is not considered significant 
gains or losses on unhedged foreign currency transactions are included in income 
the company and its foreign subsidiaries periodically use short term forward exchange contracts to limit the exposure of certain foreign currency transactions and balances to fluctuating exchange rates 
as of december   the company had no outstanding forward exchange contracts 
from time to time  the company extends us dollar denominated loans or extended trade receivables to its foreign subsidiaries 
gains or losses on such transactions are recorded in income 
as of december   the company had trade receivables of million due from its brazilian subsidiary 
a hypothetical fluctuation of percent in the exchange rate of the brazilian real would result in a gain or loss of million 
interest rates the company s debt was composed of fixed rate and variable rate borrowings totaling million and million  respectively  as of december  for  it is projected that interest on variable rate borrowings will total approximately million 
a hypothetical percent average change to short term interest rates would result in a million increase or decrease to interest expense for the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt  including current maturities  was estimated to be million as of december   which was approximately million above the carrying value 
market risk was estimated as the potential increase to the fair value that would result from a hypothetical percent decrease in the company s weighted average long term borrowing rates at december   or million 
commodity price risk certain raw materials used in the manufacture of the company s products are subject to price volatility caused by weather  petroleum prices  general economic demand and other unpredictable factors 
increased raw material costs are passed on to customers as quickly as the marketplace allows  however  certain customers have arrangements that allow for price changes only on a quarterly basis  and competitive pressures sometimes prevent cost increases from being passed on to customers  particularly in periods where there is excess industry capacity 
as a result  for some product lines or market segments it may take time to recover raw material price increases 
periodically  firm purchase commitments are entered into which fix the price of a specific commodity that will be delivered at a future time 
forward contracts are sometimes used to aid 
table of contents in managing the company s natural gas costs 
the company may contract up to percent of its forecasted annual natural gas requirements 
at december   the company had open forward contracts for the purchase of million dekatherms of natural gas in at a cost of million 
the current contracts cover expected natural gas usage primarily for the first quarter of a hypothetical percent fluctuation in the price of natural gas covered by forward contracts would result in the company s natural gas cost being million to million higher or lower than the contractual price in the company s results of operations
