table of contents fiscal quarter ended april july october january dollars in millions sales operating income loss of full year sales operating income loss fiscal quarter ended april july october january dollars in millions sales operating income loss of full year sales operating income loss critical accounting policies and estimates in the ordinary course of business  the company has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial condition in the preparation of its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
the company believes that the following discussion addresses the company s most critical accounting policies and estimates 
asset impairments the carrying value of long lived assets is evaluated whenever changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
in performing such reviews for recoverability  the company compares the expected cash flows to the carrying value of long lived assets for the applicable stores 
if the expected future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of such assets  the company recognizes an impairment loss for the difference between the carrying amount and the estimated fair value 
expected future cash flows  which are estimated over each store s remaining lease term  contain estimates of sales and the impact those future sales will have upon cash flows 
future sales are estimated based  in part  upon a projection of each store s sales trend based on the actual sales of the past several years 
additionally  each store s future cash contribution is based upon the most recent year s actual cash contribution  but is adjusted based upon projected trends in sales and store operating costs 
fair value is estimated using expected discounted future cash flows  with the discount rate approximating the company s borrowing rate 
significant deterioration in the performance of the company s stores compared to projections could result in significant additional asset impairments 
goodwill impairment pursuant to the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets fas  the company s goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
pursuant to fas  a reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment a component  for which discrete financial information is available and reviewed by management 
the company s reporting units were identified as the operating segments of domestic borders superstores  waldenbooks specialty retail and corporate  and the country components of the international operating segment 
the carrying amounts of the net 
table of contents assets of the applicable reporting units including goodwill are compared to the estimated fair values of those reporting units 
fair value is estimated using a discounted cash flow model which depends on  among other factors  estimates of future sales and expense trends  liquidity and capitalization 
the discount rate used approximates the weighted average cost of capital of a hypothetical third party buyer 
changes in any of the assumptions underlying these estimates may result in the future impairment of goodwill 
as of january   no impairment of goodwill existed 
inventory the carrying value of the company s inventory is affected by reserves for shrinkage  markdowns and non returnable inventory 
projections of shrinkage are based upon the results of regular  periodic physical counts of the company s inventory 
the company s shrinkage reserve is adjusted as warranted based upon the trends yielded by the physical counts 
reserves for non returnable inventory are based upon the company s history of liquidating non returnable inventory 
the markdown percentages utilized in developing the reserve are evaluated against actual  ongoing markdowns of non returnable inventory to ensure that they remain consistent 
significant differences between future experience and that which was projected for either the shrinkage or non returnable inventory reserves could affect the recorded amounts of inventory and cost of sales 
the company includes certain distribution and other expenses in its inventory costs  particularly freight  distribution payroll  and certain occupancy expenses 
in addition  certain selling  general and administrative expenses are included in inventory costs 
these amounts totaled approximately million and million as of january  and january   respectively 
the extent to which these costs are included in inventory is based on certain estimates of space and labor allocation 
leases all leases are reviewed for capital or operating classification at their inception under the guidance of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for leases fas  as amended 
the company uses its incremental borrowing rate in the assessment of lease classification 
gift cards the company sells gift cards to its customers and records a liability for the face value of all certificates issued and unredeemed within the last months 
for certificates older than months  the company records a liability for a portion of the certificates face value based upon historical redemption trends  and records the related income as a component of other revenue 
to the extent that future redemption patterns differ from those historically experienced  significant variations in the recorded reserves may result 
advertising and vendor incentive programs the company receives payments and credits from vendors pursuant to co operative advertising programs  shared markdown programs  purchase volume incentive programs and magazine slotting programs 
these programs continue to be beneficial for both the company and vendors  and the company expects continued participation in these types of programs 
changes in vendor participation levels  as well as changes in the volume of merchandise purchased  among other factors  could adversely impact the company s results of operations and liquidity 
pursuant to co operative advertising programs offered by vendors  the company contracts with vendors to promote merchandise for specified time periods 
pursuant to the provisions of emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor eitf  vendor consideration which represents a reimbursement of specific  incremental  identifiable costs is included in the selling  general and administrative line on the consolidated statements of operations  along with the related costs  in the period the promotion takes place 
consideration which exceeds such costs is classified as a reduction of the cost of 
table of contents merchandise sold line on the consolidated statements of operations 
additionally  the company has recorded million and million of vendor consideration as a reduction to its inventory balance at january  and january   respectively 
the company also receives credits from vendors pursuant to shared markdown programs  purchase volume programs  and magazine slotting programs 
credits received pursuant to these programs are classified in the cost of merchandise sold line on the consolidated statements of operations  and are recognized upon certain product volume thresholds being met or product placements occurring 
income taxes the company must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
in addition  the calculation of the company s tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
the company recognizes liabilities for anticipated tax issues in the united states and other tax jurisdictions based on an estimate of whether  and to the extent which  additional taxes will be due 
the company also records a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets arising from certain net operating losses when it is more likely than not that some portion of all of such net operating losses will not be realized 
the company s effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings  changes in the expected outcome of audit controversies or changes in the deferred tax valuation allowance 
new accounting guidance in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment fas r  which is a revision of fas fas r supersedes apb no 
 and amends fas no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in fas r is similar to the approach described in fas however  fas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
the company will adopt fas r in the first quarter of using the modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the adoption date based on a the requirements of fas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of statement for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of statement r that remain unvested on the effective date 
as of january   there were million stock option awards granted to employees that remain unvested 
the company currently recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options 
based on the adoption of fas r in the first quarter of  the company estimates the impact to not exceed an after tax charge of approximately million in fiscal fas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while the company cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions were million  million and million in  and  respectively

fin 
fin clarifies the term conditional asset retirement obligation and clarifies when an entity has sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
the interpretation requires the accelerated recognition of certain asset retirement obligations when a fair value of such obligations can be estimated 
the interpretation became effective for the company in the fourth quarter of the company s adoption of fin did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk during the normal course of business from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the exposure to these risks is managed though a combination of normal operating and financing activities  which may include the use of derivative financial instruments in the form of interest rate swaps and forward foreign currency exchange contracts 
interest rate risk the company is subject to risk resulting from interest rate fluctuations  as interest on certain of the company s borrowings is based on variable rates 
the company s objective in managing its exposure to 
table of contents interest rate fluctuations is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs 
historically  the company had utilized interest rate swaps to achieve this objective  effectively converting a portion of its variable rate exposure to fixed interest rates 
currently  the company has no such agreements in effect 
the company is also subject to risk associated with the fair value of its million of notes which are fixed rate debt 
to eliminate this risk  the company is currently utilizing an interest rate swap  effectively converting the notes fixed interest rate to a variable rate 
libor is the rate upon which the company s variable rate debt is principally based

it is the policy of the company not to purchase financial and or derivative instruments for speculative purposes 
at january   the company had no foreign currency forward contracts outstanding
