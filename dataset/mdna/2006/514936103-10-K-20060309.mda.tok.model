item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
title operations products and services title insurance title insurance policies are insured statements of the condition of title to real property 
these policies indemnify the insured from losses resulting from certain outstanding liens  encumbrances and other defects in title to real property that appear as matters of public record  and from certain other matters not of public record 
title insurance is generally accepted as the most efficient means of determining title to  and priority of interests in  real estate in nearly all parts of the united states 
many of the principal customers of title insurance companies buy insurance for the accuracy and reliability of the title search as well as for the indemnity features of the policy 
the beneficiaries of title insurance policies are generally owners or buyers of real property or parties who make loans using real property as security 
an owner s policy protects the named insured against title defects  liens and encumbrances existing as of the date of the policy and not specifically excluded or excepted from its provisions  while a lender s policy also insures the validity and priority of the lien of the insured mortgage as stated in the title policy 
while most other forms of insurance provide for the assumption of risk of loss arising out of unforeseen future events  title insurance serves to protect the policyholder from the risk of loss from events that predate the issuance of the policy 
this distinction underlies the low claims loss experience of title insurers as compared to other insurance underwriters 
losses generally result either from judgment errors or mistakes made in the title search and examination process or the escrow process or from hidden defects such as fraud  forgery  incapacity or missing heirs 
title insurers incur considerable operating costs relating to the personnel required to process forms  search titles  collect information on specific properties and prepare title insurance commitments and policies 
we issue title insurance policies primarily through three principal title underwriting subsidiaries  commonwealth land title insurance company commonwealth  lawyers title insurance corporation lawyers title  and transnation title insurance company transnation 
we also own three other title insurance underwriters  commonwealth land title insurance company of new jersey  land title insurance company  and title insurance company of america 
we merged another title insurance underwriter  transnation title insurance company of new york  into commonwealth effective december   subject to final approval of the new york department of insurance 
the collective operations of these subsidiaries cover the entire united states with the exception of iowa  which does not recognize title insurance and certain territories of the united states and canada 
in addition  we offer customers international title policy services in mexico  the caribbean  latin america  and europe 
escrow and closing services in addition to the issuance of title insurance policies  we provide escrow and closing services to a broad based customer group that includes lenders  developers  real estate agents  attorneys and property buyers and sellers 
in california and a number of western states  it is a general practice  incident to the issuance of title insurance policies  to hold funds and documents in escrow for delivery in real estate transactions upon fulfillment of the conditions to such delivery 
in the mid western states  florida and some eastern cities  it is customary for the title company to close the transaction and disburse the sale or loan proceeds 
fees for escrow and closing services are generally separate and distinct from premiums paid for title insurance policies and other real estate related services 
commercial services our commercial services division assists customers in handling the more complex nature of commercial transactions and facilitates the coordination and delivery of products and services 
in addition to title insurance and escrow and closing services  we provide a range of specialized services that include property appraisal and valuation  building and site assessments and other due diligence services  survey coordination  zoning certification  construction disbursement  coordination of national multi state transactions  tax deferred real property exchanges pursuant to section of the internal revenue code and uniform commercial code products insuring personal property 
the combined capital position of our three principal title underwriting subsidiaries enables us to underwrite large commercial policies and to participate in multi state transactions 
real estate transaction management services through our subsidiary  landamerica onestop  inc landamerica onestop  we offer to the national and regional mortgage lending community a full range of integrated residential real estate services and the ability to manage the delivery of those services through a centralized source 
landamerica onestop provides these mortgage originators with a single  convenient point of contact through which they may place all of their orders for title insurance and real estate related services 
transaction management services are provided by landamerica onestop  our other subsidiaries or through joint ventures or strategic alliances with third parties and include the coordination and delivery of title insurance  mortgage credit reporting  flood zone determinations  property appraisal and valuation  property inspections  closing and escrow services  and real estate tax payment services 
underwriting we issue title insurance policies on the basis of a title report  prepared pursuant to our prescribed underwriting guidelines  generally after a search of the public records  maps and documents to ascertain the existence of easements  restrictions  rights of way  conditions  encumbrances  liens or other matters affecting the title to  or use of  real property 
in certain instances  a visual inspection of the property is also made 
title examinations may be made by branch employees  agency personnel or approved attorneys  whose reports are utilized by or rendered to a branch or agent and are the basis for the issuance of policies 
in the case of difficult or unusual legal or underwriting issues involving potential title risks  the branch office or agent is instructed to consult with  and obtain prior approval of  a designated supervising office 
our contracts with independent agents require that the agent seek our prior approval before we assume a risk over a stated dollar limit 
we own a number of title plants and in some areas lease or participate with other title insurance companies or agents in the cooperative operation of such plants 
title plants are compilations of copies of public records  maps and documents that are indexed to specific properties in an area  and they serve to facilitate the preparation of title reports 
to maintain the value of the title plants  we continually update our records by regularly adding current information from the public records and other sources 
in this way  we maintain the ability to produce quickly and at a reduced expense a statement of the instruments that constitute the chain of title to a particular property 
in many of the larger markets  the title plant and search procedures have been automated 
we anticipate that the use of electronic media at courthouses and state and local governments will continue to grow over the next several years which may reduce the value of our title plants in the future 
operations we issue title insurance policies through branch offices of our title insurance underwriters  wholly owned or partially owned but consolidated subsidiary agencies  or through partially owned or independent title insurance agents 
where the policy is issued through a branch or wholly owned subsidiary agency operation  the search is performed by or at our direction  and the premiums collected are retained by us 
where the policy is issued through a title insurance agent  whether or not partially owned by us  the agent generally performs the search in some areas searches are performed by attorneys  examines the title  collects the premium and retains a majority of the premium 
the agent remits to us the remainder of the premium as compensation  part of which is for bearing the risk of loss in the event a claim is made under the policy 
the percentage of the premium retained by an agent varies from region to region and is sometimes regulated by the states 
we are obligated to pay title claims in accordance with the terms of our policies  regardless of whether we issue policies through direct operations or agents 
we maintain a quality assurance program for our independent agents 
see insured risk on policies in force 
the premium for title insurance is due in full when the real estate transaction is closed 
we recognize title insurance premium revenue from direct operations upon the closing of the transaction  whereas we recognize premium revenue from agency operations upon the reporting of such premiums by the agent 
premiums from agents are typically remitted to us after the closing of the real estate transaction  with the average time between closing and reporting for being approximately days 
we license title production and accounting software from third parties  including some competitors  some of which is critical to the operation of our business 
insured risk on policies in force the amount of the insured risk or face amount of insurance under a title insurance policy is generally equal to either the purchase price of the property or the amount of the loan secured by the property 
the insurer is also responsible for the cost of defending the insured title against covered claims 
the insurer s actual exposure at any time is significantly less than the total face amount of policies in force because the risk on an owner s policy is often reduced over time as a result of subsequent transfers of the property and the reissuance of title insurance by other title insurance underwriters  and the coverage of a lender s policy is reduced and eventually terminated as a result of payment of the mortgage loan 
because of these factors  the total liability of a title underwriter on outstanding policies cannot be precisely ascertained 
in the ordinary course of business  our underwriting subsidiaries represent and defend the interests of their insureds  and our consolidated financial statements provide for estimated losses and loss adjustment expenses arising from claims 
title insurers are sometimes subject to unusual claims such as claims of indian tribes to land formerly inhabited by them  claims resulting from fraud and defalcation  claims from large classes of claimants and other claims arising outside the insurance contract  including but not limited to  alleged negligence in search  examination or closing  alleged improper claims handling  alleged bad faith  alleged collection of excess premiums from certain consumers alleged to be entitled to a re issue rate  and alleged improper charges for recording and other fees 
the damages alleged in such claims arising outside the insurance contract may exceed the stated liability limits of the policies involved 
standard poor s s p  a division of the mcgraw hill companies  inc  has assigned a financial strength rating of a to our title insurance operations 
according to s p  an insurer rated a has strong financial security characteristics  but is somewhat more likely to be affected by adverse business conditions than are insurers with higher ratings  and the minus rating indicates relative standing within the a category 
s p assigns a ratings outlook along with its letter ratings to indicate its expectations of trends that relate to the financial strength rating for the rated company 
the ratings outlook assigned by s p may be either positive  stable or negative 
according to s p  our ratings outlook is stable 
fitch  inc fitch has assigned an a rating to our financial strength 
according to fitch  an a rating is assigned to those companies that possess strong capacity to meet policyholder and contract obligations  where risk factors are moderate and the impact of any adverse business and economic factors is expected to be small 
fitch also assigns a ratings outlook along with its letter ratings to indicate its expectations of trends that relate to the financial strength rating for the rated company 
the ratings outlook assigned by fitch may be either positive  stable or negative 
according to fitch  our ratings outlook is stable 
the s p and fitch ratings are not designed for the protection of investors and do not constitute recommendations to buy  sell or hold any security 
additionally  both fitch and s p have assigned senior debt ratings to our convertible debentures due and they have been assigned ratings of bbb and bbb  respectively 
we place a high priority on maintaining effective quality assurance and claims administration programs 
our quality assurance program focuses on quality control  claims prevention and product risk assessment for our independent agencies 
the claims administration program focuses on improving liability analysis  prompt  fair and effective handling of claims  early evaluation of settlement or litigation with first and third party claimants and appropriate use of adr alternative dispute resolution in claims processing 
in addition  to reduce the incidence of agency defalcations  we established due diligence requirements in connection with the appointment of new agents  procedures for renewing existing agents and an agency audit program 
we continue to refine our systems for maintaining effective quality assurance and claims administration programs 
facultative reinsurance and coinsurance our title insurance subsidiaries distribute large title insurance risks by entering into facultative reinsurance agreements with other title insurance companies the reinsurer 
in facultative reinsurance agreements  the reinsurer assumes a portion of the risk that the primary title insurance company the ceding company or ceder decides not to retain in consideration of a premium 
the ceder  however  remains liable to the insured under the policy for the total risk  whether or not the reinsurer meets its obligation 
reinsurance agreements may be entered into with related title insurance companies and or with unaffiliated title insurance companies 
when facultative reinsurance agreements are entered into  a primary risk generally in the amount of million is retained by the ceder 
we enter into reinsurance arrangements both as the reinsurer and the ceder 
we generally purchase facultative reinsurance from unaffiliated reinsurers based upon our review of the underwriting risks  the retention laws of the state where the property is located and the state where the ceding company is domiciled  and the retention limitations imposed by the customer 
we utilize coinsurance to enable us to provide coverage in amounts greater than we would be willing or able to undertake individually 
in coinsurance transactions  generally  each individual underwriting company issues a separate policy and assumes a portion of the overall total risk 
each coinsurer is liable only for the particular portion of the risk it assumes 
our title insurance subsidiaries enter into facultative reinsurance and coinsurance arrangements with most of the larger participants in the title insurance market  and such arrangements are not concentrated with any single title insurance company 
revenue and claims from facultative reinsurance are not material to our business as a whole 
the exposure on assumed reinsurance risks is reduced due to the ceding company s retention of a significant primary risk 
in addition  the exposure under these agreements generally ceases upon a transfer of the property and  with respect to insured loans  is decreased by reductions in mortgage loan balances 
for these reasons  the actual exposure is much less than the total reinsurance our title insurance subsidiaries have assumed 
loss reserves on assumed reinsurance business are maintained on a basis consistent with reserves for direct business 
we maintain excess of loss catastrophic insurance through lloyd s of london totaling million 
the lloyd s policy provides fidelity and title loss coverage up to million with a million deductible for title losses and a lesser deductible for other losses 
we have not paid as reinsurer or recovered as ceder any material reinsured losses under a facultative reinsurance agreement during the three year period ended december  title operations revenue the table below sets forth  for the years ended december   and  the approximate title operating revenue and percentages of our total title revenue for the five states representing the largest percentages of such revenue and for all other states and countries combined revenue by state dollars in millions california florida texas new york arizona other total title revenue title operating revenues represented percent  percent and percent of our total consolidated operating revenues for the years ended december   and sales and marketing the title insurance market for sales and marketing purposes  we generally distinguish between residential and commercial real estate transactions 
residential real estate business results from the construction  sale  resale and refinancing of residential properties  while commercial real estate business results from similar activities with respect to properties with a business or commercial use 
although precise data is not available to compare the percentage of our total premium revenue derived from residential versus commercial real estate transactions  approximately percent of such revenue in resulted from policies providing coverage of million or less which tend to be residential and approximately percent of such revenue resulted from policies providing coverage in excess of million which tend to be commercial 
residential transactions our primary source of residential business is from the local real estate community  such as attorneys  real estate brokers and developers  financial institutions  mortgage brokers and independent escrow agents 
we serve the residential market through two major distribution channels direct company owned offices and title insurance agents 
maintenance and expansion of these referral sources is integral to our marketing strategy for local residential business 
because most of our residential business arises from these local relationships  we are committed to providing an array of service offerings to these customers that  along with title insurance and closing services  provide a more complete solution to their residential real estate transaction needs 
commercial transactions our commercial services division specializes in coordinating  underwriting and closing complex commercial and multi property transactions 
as part of the implementation of our customer focused strategy  in we began aligning our local commercial offices with our national commercial offices 
as of december   we have personnel providing commercial transaction expertise in offices in geographic markets in the united states 
each office is focused on providing transaction and support services to national and local commercial accounts 
the transaction and support services benefit both company offices as well as independent agents who handle substantial commercial transactions 
in addition  we believe we are one of the more strongly capitalized title insurers in the industry  with an aggregate statutory equity of million as of december  our financial strength is an important factor in marketing our commercial title business capabilities  enabling it to underwrite larger title policies and retain higher levels of risk without purchasing reinsurance from a third party 
our financial strength  as evidenced by the ratings from s p and fitch  is important in competing for commercial title insurance business 
see additional information on our financial strength ratings in the section entitled insured risk on policies in force above 
marketing strategy we continue our transition from title insurance product delivery to providing multiple real estate transaction services 
this strategy entails becoming more of a single source provider of the multiple products and services involved in real estate transactions 
we continue to differentiate ourselves based on customer service and to expand a branding process to identify all of our operations under the landamerica name 
in  we continued to focus on customer service initiatives  including supporting our superior service guarantee in most of our branch offices that provides for the refund of the escrow fee when a residential customer is not satisfied with our service  supporting lenderxtra sm  a flexible approach to product bundling that allows national lenders to create customized service packages that include lenderxtraorder  our online platform that allows real time  instant price quotes and order conversion for bundled lender services  enhancing our agentextra sm program as a standard for delivering customized business and marketing solutions to our national network of agents  introducing in select markets landamclosing 
com  a web based site for opening and closing orders and the management of documents by our residential customers  and supporting the landamerica commercial connection  a web based site for opening and closing orders and the management of documents by our commercial customers 
customers as of december   no single agent was responsible for more than percent of our title insurance revenue 
in addition  our title insurance business is not dependent upon any single customer 
the loss of any independent agent or customer would not have a material adverse effect on us 
competition the business of providing real estate transaction services is very competitive 
competition for residential title insurance business is based primarily on price and quality of service 
service quality is based upon a number of factors  including the ability to respond quickly and accurately to customers and technological capabilities resulting in the delivery of a readily accessible  efficient and reliable product 
with respect to national and regional lenders  service quality includes a large distribution network and the ability to deliver a broad array of real estate services quickly  efficiently and through a single point of contact 
competition for commercial title business is based primarily on price  service  expertise in complex transactions and the size and financial strength of the insurer 
title insurance underwriters also compete for agents on the basis of service and commission levels 
for each of these customer groups  we have increased our emphasis on service levels and the variety of services and products we provide 
our principal competitors are other major title insurance underwriters and their agency networks 
our principal competitors during were fidelity national title group  inc which was spun off from fidelity national financial  inc in october fnt  old republic international corporation  stewart information services  inc and the first american corporation 
while there are approximately title insurance underwriting companies licensed in the united states that generate percent of the industry s underwriting market  the top five companies consisting of us and our four principal competitors and their consolidated subsidiaries accounted for approximately percent of the title insurance underwriting market in  the latest date for which information is available  based on public filings made by those companies 
our title insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the insurance authorities and enforcement of laws by other governmental authorities of the states in which they do business 
our title insurance subsidiaries are subject to compliance with the real estate settlement procedures act respa on one to four family residential transactions which is primarily enforced by the us department of housing and urban development 
see regulation 
within this regulatory framework  we compete with respect to premium rates  coverage  risk evaluation  service and business development 
state regulatory authorities impose underwriting limits on title insurers based primarily on levels of available capital and surplus 
we have underwriting limits that are comparable to our four principal competitors 
while such limits may theoretically hinder our title insurance subsidiaries assumption of a particular large underwriting liability  in practice we have established our own internal risk limits at levels substantially lower than those allowed by state law 
in addition  we may spread the risk of a large underwriting liability over our three principal title underwriting subsidiaries 
therefore  we do not consider statutory capital based risk limits to be a significant factor in the amount of underwriting we may undertake 
business strategy our long term objective is to enhance our position as a premier provider and manager of integrated real estate transaction services while maximizing our profitability throughout the real estate market cycle 
to accomplish this objective  we are pursuing various business initiatives designed to broaden our market position and provide the framework to enhance growth and maximize profitability 
focusing on the customer we have a customer focused strategy to increase intimacy with our customers 
in conjunction with that strategy  we have leadership positions and teams to support our primary customer groups agents  residential  commercial and national lenders 
with the objective of fostering customer loyalty  these leaders and teams are responsible for consistent service quality and operational excellence by providing common support platforms and structures for the various markets in which we operate 
our shared support resources are organized to provide direct support to our customer focused operations 
production and process improvement is a shared resource providing title production services to our teams that support our primary customer groups 
technology resources focus on providing superior customer service and increasing our operational efficiency through electronic business solutions and technology support 
our other shared resources  such as human resources and legal  provide direct support to our internal customers through dedicated business partners 
expanding title insurance distribution capabilities and broadening real estate transaction services offerings we seek to increase our share of the title insurance market by expanding and enhancing our distribution channels through the hiring and retention of experienced industry professionals with strong local relationships  the opening of new offices in markets with the potential for significant transaction volume  acquisitions of title insurance agencies or underwriters and selectively engaging in title insurance agency joint ventures in order to strengthen our presence in particularly attractive markets 
in the case of the acquisition of agencies or small to medium size underwriters  we review the agency s or underwriter s profitability  location  growth potential in its existing market  claims experience and  in the case of an underwriter  the adequacy of its reserves 
in  we acquired two title agencies and one escrow company 
throughout our title customer base  there is demand for providers of multiple  diverse real estate transaction services 
in particular  the large national mortgage lenders expect that necessary services related to the mortgage financing process will be available from and billed by a single source 
our strategy is to continue to expand both our array of real estate transaction products and services available to lenders and other title customers and the distribution channels through which they are offered 
maintaining commercial real estate market strength participation in the commercial real estate market partially offsets some of the cyclicality of the residential real estate market  where transaction volumes are more susceptible to changes in interest rates 
we maintain our presence in the commercial real estate market primarily due to the high quality service that we provide and our expertise in handling complex transactions  the financial strength ratings of our underwriting subsidiaries and our strong capital position 
in particular  the combined capital position of our three principal underwriting subsidiaries enables us to underwrite large commercial policies while purchasing less facultative reinsurance  thus increasing profitability 
reducing costs and expenses losses resulting from claims under title insurance policies represent a relatively small part of our overall costs 
operating costs constitute the largest portion of expenses relating to providing title insurance and are relatively high compared to other types of insurers 
we utilize a production unit model in which our three principal title operating subsidiaries share a single back office processing center in a geographic region while continuing to market from separate storefronts under different operating names 
in  we expanded our production unit model by aligning our title production units under one division 
the production division is responsible for the delivery of title products to our direct company owned offices and title insurance agents 
we provide escrow support from several centralized locations  thereby increasing service levels and improving efficiency 
we have also implemented out sourcing and off shoring initiatives to streamline operations in areas where it has been determined that these initiatives will be cost efficient  improve customer service  and provide value to our shareholders 
enhancing cost control flexibility we manage our personnel and other operational expenses to reflect changes in the level of activity in the real estate market 
as a result  our employee base expands and contracts over time 
personnel and administrative costs in the title operations segment do not decrease as rapidly as transaction volumes decrease due to our inability to change headcount in direct correlation to volume changes 
any acquisition also expands our employee base 
in order to manage personnel costs more efficiently throughout the real estate cycle  we use temporary or part time employees where appropriate to staff operations so we can respond more rapidly to changes in real estate activity 
regulation the title insurance business is regulated by state regulatory authorities that possess broad powers relating to the granting and revoking of licenses  and the type and amount of investments which our title insurance subsidiaries may make 
these state authorities also regulate insurance rates  forms of policies  claims handling procedures and the form and content of required annual statements  and have the power to audit and examine financial and other records and the market conduct of these companies 
other governmental authorities have the power to enforce state and federal laws to which our title insurance subsidiaries are subject  including but not limited to  state anti rebate and anti kickback statutes and respa 
some states require title insurers to own or lease title plants 
a substantial portion of the assets of our title underwriting subsidiaries consists of their portfolios of investment securities 
each of these subsidiaries is required by the laws of its state of domicile to maintain assets of a statutorily defined quality and amount 
see investment policies below 
under state laws  certain levels of capital and surplus must be maintained and certain amounts of portfolio securities must be segregated or deposited with appropriate state officials 
various state statutes require title insurers to defer a portion of all premiums in a reserve for the protection of policyholders and to segregate investments in a corresponding amount 
state regulatory policies also restrict the amount of dividends and distributions that title insurance companies may pay to their shareholders without prior regulatory approval 
generally  all of the title underwriters that meet certain financial thresholds are required to engage independent auditors to audit their statutory basis financial statements which  along with the auditor s report  must be filed with the state insurance regulators 
the national association of insurance commissioners the naic has adopted model legislation that if enacted by individual states would regulate title insurers and agents nationally and would change certain statutory reporting requirements 
the model legislation also would require title insurers to audit agents periodically and require licensed agents to maintain professional liability insurance 
a number of states have adopted legislation similar to some of the provisions contained in the naic model legislation 
we cannot predict whether all or any portion of the proposed legislation or any other legislation further regulating title insurers and agents will be adopted in any other states or federally 
also  the naic has adopted an instruction requiring an annual certification of reserve adequacy by a qualified actuary 
because all of the states in which our title insurance subsidiaries are domiciled require adherence to naic filing procedures  each such subsidiary  unless it qualifies for an exemption  must file an actuarial opinion with respect to the adequacy of its reserves 
many state insurance regulatory laws intended primarily for the protection of policyholders contain provisions that require advance approval by state agencies of any change in control of an insurance company or insurance holding company that is domiciled or  in some cases  doing business in that state 
under such current laws  any future transaction that would constitute a change in control would generally require approval by the state insurance departments of arizona  california  new jersey  pennsylvania  tennessee  texas and virginia 
such a requirement could have the effect of delaying or preventing certain transactions affecting the control or the ownership of our common stock  including transactions that could be advantageous to our shareholders 
cyclicality and seasonality the title insurance business is closely related to the overall level of residential and commercial real estate activity  which is generally affected by the relative strength or weakness of the united states economy 
in addition  title insurance volumes fluctuate based on the effect that changes in interest rates have on the level of real estate activity 
periods of increasing interest rates usually have an adverse impact on real estate activity and therefore premium and fee revenue 
in contrast  real estate activity usually increases when interest rates fall 
during  interest rates continued to remain at relatively low levels in comparison to interest rates in the united states over the past three years 
prior to  residential real estate activity has been generally slower in the winter  when fewer families buy or sell homes  with increased volumes in the spring and summer 
residential refinancing activity is generally more uniform throughout the seasons  but is subject to interest rate variability 
we typically report our lowest revenue in the first quarter  with revenue increasing into the second quarter and through the third quarter 
the fourth quarter customarily may be as strong as the third quarter  depending on the level of activity in the commercial real estate market 
due to an unusually low interest rate environment in the last three years  our results have not followed the typical seasonal patterns 
in  and  our fourth quarter revenue was stronger than the third quarter 
in and  this increase was primarily due to an increase in commercial real estate activity and refinance activity 
in  the increase in fourth quarter revenue was due to an increase in commercial real estate activity and other direct revenue 
revenue for was more in line with our typical historical results 
environmental matters title insurance policies specifically exclude any liability for environmental risks or contamination 
policies issued before  while not specifically addressing environmental risks  are not considered to provide any coverage for such matters  and we have not experienced and do not expect any significant expenses related to environmental claims 
through our subsidiaries  we sometimes act as a temporary title holder to real estate under a nominee holding agreement and sometimes participate in title holding agreements involving tax deferred exchanges 
our customers in such situations generally are financially strong entities from whom we secure indemnification for potential environmental and other claims 
in other situations where we might acquire title to real estate  we will generally require that an appropriate environmental assessment be made to evaluate and avoid any potential liability 
lender services products and services the lender services segment focuses on mortgage lenders as a distinct customer base for certain of our products and services  which include real estate tax processing  flood zone certifications  consumer mortgage credit reporting  default management services  and mortgage loan subservicing 
in  lender services reorganized the management of the independent operations described below to represent the products and services offered by and manage the operations of those entities under the lender services umbrella with focus on the three lines of business of its lender customers loan origination  loan servicing  and subservicing 
tax services landamerica tax flood services  inc latf offers real estate tax processing services to mortgage lenders 
latf monitors and reports real estate property tax data needed by mortgage lenders on properties securing loans made by such mortgage lenders 
during the lending process  latf can advise lenders whether any delinquent taxes are associated with the property 
where the lender requires an escrow for the payment of taxes by borrowers during the term of the loan  latf determines the timing and amount of the tax payment due on the property and interfaces with the loan servicing department of the mortgage lender and the various local taxing authorities to facilitate the timely payment of real property taxes 
services performed for mortgage lenders vary significantly  as some lenders prefer complete outsourcing of all tax service functions to latf while other lenders prefer to perform their own tax services and purchase data from latf 
we believe that the trend among large lenders recently has been to perform certain functions of their own tax services  known as insourcing 
latf has developed a series of products to provide those lenders with the data and other tools they need to insource tax service functions 
four mortgage lending customers account for approximately percent of latf s gross revenue 
latf competes on the basis of price and service with its three main competitors in the tax service business the first american corporation  fidelity national financial corporation and zc sterling insurance agency  inc flood zone certifications through latf  we provide mortgage lenders with information to determine if property that is to be used to secure a loan is located in a special flood hazard area as defined by the us federal emergency management agency fema 
if the structure is in a special flood hazard area  the borrower is required to purchase flood insurance prior to closing of the transaction 
latf s flood service includes an initial flood zone determination report provided to the lender at the origination of the loan and subsequent notifications to the lender during the term of the loan of any changes in a property s flood zone status brought about by changes in flood insurance rate maps by fema 
although there are numerous suppliers of flood zone certification services  the largest competitors of latf with whom it competes on the basis of price and service are the first american corporation and fidelity national financial  inc in  we launched an enhanced latfnet  a web based order entry and reporting system for our tax and flood customers 
consumer mortgage credit reporting we provide consumer mortgage credit reporting services through landamerica credit services  inc lacs 
lacs is a nationwide provider of consumer credit reports and income  employment  and tax return verifications to lenders engaged in mortgage origination 
lacs s technology interfaces with many loan origination systems and permits hours  days a week monitoring and response 
our credit information is obtained using technology linked to the three major credit repositories equifax  experian and trans union 
in addition  through lacs s bureau direct  a borrower s erroneous credit information can be updated at each of the three major credit repositories in hours or less  thereby reducing the necessary paperwork and time required by the borrower and the lender seeking to close a consumer s lending transaction 
although there are numerous suppliers of credit reporting services  the largest competitors of lacs are the first american corporation and kroll factual data  inc default management our subsidiary  landamerica default services company lads  provides comprehensive default management services to lenders and mortgage servicing operations 
these services consist of customized reports  broker price opinions and appraisals  foreclosure  management of properties acquired at foreclosure  bankruptcy services  reconveyance processing and lien release 
although there are numerous suppliers of default management services  the largest competitors of lads with whom it competes on the basis of price and service are the first american corporation and fidelity national title group  inc mortgage loan subservicing we provide loan subservicing services through our subsidiary  loancare servicing center  inc loancare  a national mortgage loan subservicer 
loancare is an approved servicer with the federal national mortgage association  the federal home loan mortgage corporation  the government national mortgage association  the federal housing administration  the veterans administration  several nationwide financial institutions  and a number of private investors 
our loan subservicing services are offered through interim and private label subservicing programs 
interim subservicing is utilized by lenders selling loans in the secondary market pending the transfer of the loans and the related servicing rights to a permanent purchaser investor 
the private label subservicing program is utilized by lenders wishing to promote the relationship between themselves and their borrowers 
although there are numerous providers of loan subservicing services  the largest competitors of loancare with whom it competes on the basis of price and service are cenlar fsb  gmac mortgage corporation  and countrywide home loans  inc portions of our lender services segment have seasonal trends similar to our title operations segment  particularly in our tax and flood and credit servicing businesses 
however  due to the nature of the revenue deferrals made in this segment  as noted above  the impact on our results of operations will differ 
in instances where we receive cash in advance for services for real estate tax payment and flood certification services  the revenue is deferred and amortized ratably over the anticipated life of the loan servicing 
this ratable amortization has the impact of reducing the volatility in revenue related to this segment  however  loss of a customer may accelerate recognition of revenue in certain periods resulting in one time volatility 
financial services the financial services segment includes orange county bancorp and its wholly owned subsidiary  centennial bank  a california industrial bank we acquired in november centennial 
centennial s primary business is the origination and bulk purchase of commercial real estate loans in the southern california market 
deposits are solicited through the internet for both certificates of deposit and passbook savings accounts 
as an industrial bank  centennial does not accept demand deposits  such as checking accounts  that provide for payment to third parties 
centennial does not offer banking services such as credit cards or automated teller machines 
we utilize centennial to hold a portion of our escrow deposits 
the following is a summary of certain information relating to centennial s deposits  loans and allowances for loan losses for the last five years 
as noted above  information related to periods prior to november   have not been included in our financial position and results of operations as we acquired the bank effective november  at december   centennial held million in total deposits 
certificates of deposit and passbook savings accounts represented percent and percent  respectively  of total deposits as of that date 
at december   centennial had million of outstanding loans which is percent of total deposits 
the average loan balance outstanding at december  was million 
centennial makes loans only on a secured basis  at loan to value percentages typically no greater than percent

loans may be returned to accrual status when all principal and interest amounts contractually due including arrearages are reasonably assured of repayment within an acceptable period of time  in accordance with the contractual payment terms of interest and principal 
while a loan is classified as non accrual and future collectibility of the recorded loan balance is doubtful  collections of both interest and principal are generally applied as a reduction to principal outstanding

a loan is charged off against the allowance for loan losses when we believe that collectibility of the principal is unlikely 
the allowance is an amount that we believe is adequate to absorb estimable and probable losses on existing loans and contracts 
we take into consideration changes in the nature and volume of our portfolio  overall portfolio quality  prior loss experience  review of specific problem loans and contracts  regulatory guidelines and current economic conditions that may affect the borrower s ability to pay

investment policies we earn investment income from our portfolio consisting primarily of fixed maturity debt securities issued principally by corporations and united states  state and local jurisdictions  as well as by united states government agencies

our portfolio is managed to comply with the various state regulatory requirements while maximizing net after tax yield 
during  we changed our guidelines to permit a percent allocation to non reit common stocks in unaffiliated entities 
our investment portfolio is managed by professional investment advisors under guidelines that govern the types of permissible investments  investment quality  maturity  duration  and concentration of issuer 
these guidelines and our investment strategies are established and periodically reexamined by the investment funds committee of our board of directors 
this committee also reviews the performance of the investment advisors on a quarterly basis 
see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
centennial s loan portfolio consists primarily of moderately sized commercial real estate loans to individuals  corporations  llcs and partnerships 
loan applications go through a rigorous underwriting process before being submitted for approval to the loan committee of centennial s board of directors 
although the vast majority of loans are secured by real estate located in california  the portfolio is well diversified by borrower  property location and property type 
loans typically meet maximum loan to value requirements of percent 
operating income and rental income generated by the real estate of the borrower generally results in a debt coverage ratio in excess of x 
monthly loan portfolio performance reports are reviewed by centennial s board of directors 
employees as of december   we had approximately  full time and  part time employees 
our relationship with our employees is good 
no employees are covered by any collective bargaining agreements  and we are not aware of any union organizing activity relating to our employees 
item a 
risk factors our business is subject to various risks  including the risks described below 
our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks 
please note that additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business and operations 
our results of operations and financial condition are susceptible to changes in mortgage interest rates and general economic conditions 
the demand for our title insurance and other real estate transaction products and services is dependent upon  among other things  the volume of commercial and residential real estate transactions  including mortgage refinancing transactions 
the volume of these transactions has historically been influenced by factors such as interest rates and the state of the overall economy 
when interest rates are increasing or during an economic downturn or recession  real estate activity typically declines and we tend to experience lower revenue and profitability 
foreign hostilities could change the demand for real estate transactions 
the cyclical nature of our business has caused fluctuations in revenue and profitability in the past and is expected to do so in the future 
in addition  changes in interest rates may have an adverse impact on our return on invested cash  the market value of our investment portfolio and interest paid on our bank debt 
our operating revenue for the year ended december  increased by percent over the prior year  primarily due to a favorable mortgage interest rate environment and strong commercial transactions 
while in mortgage interest rates continued to remain at relatively low levels  we have experienced a decline in refinancing transactions since the third quarter of when mortgage interest rates began to moderately increase 
for fiscal year  we expect that the level of refinancing transactions will be substantially below the levels experienced in recent years 
we are subject to government regulation 
we are subject to federal and state laws and regulations that are administered and enforced by insurance regulators and other governmental authorities 
these laws and regulations are generally intended for the protection of policyholders and consumers rather than security holders 
the nature and extent of these laws and regulations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction  and their applicability varies from subsidiary to subsidiary  but typically involve prior approval of the acquisition and control of an insurance company or of any company controlling an insurance company  regulation of certain transactions  including dividend payments  entered into by an insurance company with any of its affiliates  approval of premium rates for insurance  standards of solvency and minimum amounts of capital surplus that must be maintained  limitations on types and amounts of investments  restrictions on the size of risks that may be insured by a single company  licensing of insurers  agents  inspectors  appraisers  home warranty  loan subservicing and other companies and or employees and independent contractors  deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders  approval of policy forms  methods of accounting  establishing reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses  regulation of underwriting  marketing and business practices  regulation of reinsurance  regulation of escrow accounts  regulation regarding the use of personal information  and filing of annual and other reports with respect to financial condition and other matters 
centennial is subject to regulation and supervision by the federal reserve bank  the federal deposit insurance corporation and the california department of financial institutions 
banking regulations are intended primarily to protect depositors and the federal deposit insurance funds and not shareholders 
regulatory requirements affect  among other things  our banking subsidiary s practices  capital level  investment practices  dividend policies and growth 
these laws and regulations are subject to change and may impede  impose burdensome conditions on  or cause rate adjustments or other actions that could materially and adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  state regulatory examiners perform periodic examinations of insurance companies 
we can make no assurances regarding the potential impact of state or federal laws  regulations  policies or interpretations that may change the nature or scope of title insurance or other regulation 
heightened regulatory scrutiny of us and the title insurance industry could materially and adversely affect our business  operating results  and financial condition 
we are and have in the past been subject to information requests and subpoenas from various regulatory authorities relating to investigations of our business practices and the title insurance industry 
multiple states are specifically investigating captive reinsurance  a practice where the reinsurer is owned by another entity who helps place the initial request for title insurance 
the government accountability office is studying the title insurance product  market  pricing  business practices  and potential regulatory changes 
multiple states have announced their intent to examine pricing levels and competition in the title insurance industry with a view to determining whether prices are too high  and if so  to implement rate reductions 
rate reductions for our title insurance products could result in decreased levels of revenue 
if we fail to reduce our staffing and other costs to a level consistent with decreased revenues  there could be a material and adverse effect on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
any restrictions imposed or actions taken by states with respect to us or the title insurance industry in general may adversely affect our business  operating results  and financial condition 
we may not be able to fuel our growth through acquisitions 
our growth has been facilitated by acquisitions  which may or may not be available on acceptable terms in the future  and which  if consummated  may or may not be advantageous to us 
while we expect to continue making acquisitions or entering into joint ventures as part of our long term business strategy to expand the services we provide and their distribution  no assurances can be given that we will do so or that we will continue to acquire businesses at the levels previously experienced 
we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or complete acquisitions on satisfactory terms 
our competitors also have adopted the strategy of expanding and diversifying through acquisitions  and as a result  we may be forced to pay more to acquire companies 
our inability to integrate and manage successfully our acquired businesses could adversely affect our business  operating results  and financial condition 
our acquisitions and joint ventures may or may not be outside of our traditional business operations 
the process of integrating any acquired business involves a number of special risks  including our inexperience in managing businesses that provide products and services beyond our traditional business  new regulatory requirements  diversion of management s attention  failure to retain key acquired personnel resulting from changes in compensation  reporting relationships  future prospects  or the direction of the business  increased costs to improve managerial  operational  financial and administrative systems  legal liabilities  amortization of acquired intangible assets  and failure in the implementation of controls  procedures and policies appropriate for a larger public company that the acquired business lacked prior to acquisition 
in addition  there can be no assurance that acquired businesses will achieve anticipated levels of revenue  earnings or performance 
our failure to manage acquisitions successfully could materially and adversely affect our business  operating results  and financial condition 
regulatory non compliance  fraud or defalcations by our title insurance agents or employees could adversely affect our business  operating results  and financial condition 
our title insurance agents are entities that often represent more than one title insurance underwriter and operate their businesses independently  but subject to various underwriting guidelines from their title underwriter s 
in addition to potential liability on policies written by our agents  governmental authorities or litigants may seek to assign liability to us for the actions of our agents in circumstances where they were acting outside the scope of their authority as agents 
in certain circumstances  we may incur losses for the fraud  defalcation  regulatory noncompliance and other misconduct of our agents and employees 
to the extent that any loss is substantial  there could be a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
competition in our industry affects our revenue 
the business of providing real estate transaction products and services is very competitive 
competition for residential title insurance business is based primarily on price and quality of service 
with respect to national and regional mortgage lenders  service quality includes a large distribution network and the ability to deliver a broad array of real estate services quickly  efficiently and through a single point of contact 
competition for commercial title business is based primarily on price  service  expertise in complex transactions and the size and financial strength of the insurer 
title insurance underwriters also compete for agents on the basis of service and commission levels 
although we are one of the largest providers of real estate transaction products and services in the united states  four other companies fnt  the first american corporation  old republic international corporation and stewart information services  inc have the size  capital base and agency networks to compete effectively with our products and services 
in addition  some of our competitors may have  or will have in the future  greater capital and other resources than us 
competition among the major providers of real estate transaction products and services and any new entrants could materially and adversely affect our business  operating results  and financial condition 
significant industry changes and new product and service introductions require timely and cost effective responses 
as a national provider of real estate transaction products and services  we participate in an industry that is subject to significant change  frequent new product and service introductions and evolving industry standards 
in addition  alternatives to traditional title insurance  such as lien protection products  have emerged in recent years 
we believe that our future success will depend on our ability to anticipate changes in technology and customer preferences and to offer products and services that meet evolving standards on a timely and cost effective basis 
the development and implementation of new products and services may require significant capital expenditures and other resources 
there is a risk that customers may not accept our new product and service offerings and we may not successfully identify new product and service opportunities nor develop and introduce new products and services in a timely and cost effective manner 
in addition  products and services that our competitors and other real estate industry participants develop or introduce may render certain of our products and services obsolete or noncompetitive 
we license software and technology from third parties  including some competitors  and incorporate it into or sell it in conjunction with our own software products  some of which is critical to the operation of our business 
if any of the third party software vendors were to change product offerings  increase prices or terminate our licenses  we might need to seek alternative vendors and incur additional internal or external development costs to ensure continued performance of our products 
such alternatives may not be available on attractive terms  or may not be as widely accepted or as effective as the software provided by our existing vendors 
if the cost of licensing or maintaining these third party software products or other technology significantly increases  our gross margin levels could significantly decrease 
further  our third party vendors may not have the capacity to develop and support software and systems that are necessary to process large volumes of transactions 
in addition  interruption in functionality of our products could adversely affect future sales of licenses and services 
advances in technology could also reduce the useful lives of our products  preventing us from recovering fully our investment in particular products and services 
as a result  our inability to anticipate industry changes and to respond with competitive and profitable products and services could materially and adversely affect our business  operating results  and financial condition 
our litigation risks include substantial claims by large classes of claimants 
from time to time we are involved in litigation arising in the ordinary course of our business 
in addition  we currently are and have in the past been subject to claims and litigation not arising in the ordinary course of business from large classes of claimants seeking substantial damages 
material pending legal proceedings not arising in the ordinary course of business are disclosed in our filings with the securities and exchange commission 
see part i  item legal proceedings set forth elsewhere in this report 
an unfavorable outcome in any class action suit or other claim  inquiry  investigation or litigation against us could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
key accounting and essential product delivery systems are concentrated in a few locations 
our corporate headquarters  accounting and technology operations are concentrated in richmond  virginia  and at our agency services center located in louisville  kentucky 
these critical business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters  fire  power shortages  and other events beyond our control 
although we are upgrading our disaster recovery functionality and have prepared a business continuity plan  a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business operations or systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and  as a result  there could be a material and adverse effect on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws  our shareholder rights plan and applicable state corporation and insurance laws could limit another party s ability to acquire us and could deprive shareholders of the opportunity to obtain a takeover premium for shares of common stock owned by them 
provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws may make it difficult for another company to acquire us and for shareholders to receive any related takeover premium for our common stock 
these provisions include  among other things a staggered board of directors in which the board of directors is divided into three classes  with one class elected each year to serve a three year term  the absence of cumulative voting in the election of directors  the removal of directors only for cause and only upon the affirmative vote of the holders of at least percent of the outstanding shares entitled to vote  a vote of at least percent of the outstanding shares entitled to vote is required for the approval of a merger or consolidation with  or a sale  lease or exchange of substantially all our assets to  any shareholder that directly or indirectly owns or controls percent or more of the voting power of us  and the ability of our board of directors to issue up to  shares of preferred stock  the terms of which may be determined by our board of directors at the time of issuance without further action by shareholders 
the issuance of any preferred stock could materially and adversely affect the rights of holders of our common stock and could reduce the value of our common stock 
in addition  specific rights granted to future holders of preferred stock could be used to restrict our ability to merge with  or sell assets to  a third party 
the ability of our board of directors to issue preferred stock could delay  discourage  prevent or make it more difficult or costly to acquire us or effect a change in control in our board of directors 
in addition  our board of directors has adopted a shareholder rights plan that could result in substantial dilution to persons or groups that acquire beneficial ownership of  or announce a tender offer for  percent or more of our common stock 
in connection with the rights plan  the board of directors has issued rights that attach to each share of common stock and authorized the issuance of  shares of series a junior participating preferred stock 
the shareholder rights plan expires on august  the laws of virginia also contain provisions designed to deter certain takeovers of virginia corporations 
the affiliated transaction provisions of virginia law prohibit  subject to certain exceptions  a virginia corporation from engaging in specified transactions with the beneficial owner of more than percent of any class of the corporation s voting securities for a period of three years following the date upon which the shareholder acquires the requisite number of securities 
the types of transactions covered by the law include certain mergers  share exchanges  material dispositions of corporate assets not in the ordinary course of business  dissolutions  reclassifications and recapitalizations 
other provisions of virginia corporation law generally deny voting rights to shares of a public corporation acquired in a control share acquisition  which is an acquisition by any person of beneficial ownership of shares that meet or exceed a specified threshold percentage percent  percent or percent of the total votes entitled to be cast for the election of directors  unless approved by a majority vote of all outstanding shares other than those held by the acquiring person 
although our charter currently makes these provisions inapplicable to acquisitions of shares of our common stock  these provisions could become applicable in the future if an amendment to our charter is approved by our board of directors and shareholders 
many state insurance regulatory laws intended primarily for the protection of policyholders contain provisions that require advance approval by state agencies of any change in control of an insurance company or insurance holding company that is domiciled or  in some cases  doing business in that state 
under such current laws  any future transaction that would constitute a change in control would generally require approval by the state insurance departments of arizona  california  new jersey  pennsylvania  tennessee  texas and virginia 
such a requirement could have the effect of delaying or preventing certain transactions affecting the control or the ownership of our common stock  including transactions that could be advantageous to our shareholders 
our future success depends on our ability to continue to attract and retain qualified employees 
our success depends upon our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled technical  managerial  sales and marketing personnel 
if our efforts in these areas are not successful  our costs may increase  development and sales efforts may be hindered and our customer service may suffer 
although we invest significant resources in recruiting and retaining employees  there is intense competition for personnel in the title insurance industry 
from time to time  we experience difficulties in locating enough highly qualified candidates in desired geographic locations  or with required industry specific expertise 
our conduct of business in foreign markets creates financial and operational risks and uncertainties that may materially and adversely affect our business  operating results  and financial condition 
we currently provide title insurance and other real estate transaction products and services in foreign countries 
as of december   we conducted business in a number of foreign markets  including mexico  canada  the caribbean  latin america  and europe 
in certain countries where we do business  our products and services have a limited history and are not well established 
as a result  market acceptance of our products and services is uncertain  and we may not be able to successfully implement our business plan 
government regulations may determine how we operate in various countries  which could limit our growth and strategy plans 
our foreign business is subject to potential changes in political and economic conditions in the local markets in which they operate  which could adversely affect their performance 
we are also subject to foreign taxes in the countries in which we operate  and changes in tax laws or the interpretation of tax laws may reduce our earnings or may increase our tax cost

item properties we own an office building and adjacent real estate in richmond  virginia that is currently used for our corporate offices 
this property consists of approximately  square feet of office space and parking facilities 
we issued a press release on january  announcing our intent to sell that property and to relocate and consolidate our national headquarters and other shared resources operations into a larger leased facility in the richmond metropolitan area 
see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in addition  we and our subsidiary  landamerica tax and flood  inc latf  own certain properties that  in the aggregate  are not material to our business taken as a whole 
our subsidiaries conduct their business operations primarily in leased office space 
as of december   we had numerous leases for our branch offices and subsidiaries throughout the states in which we operate 
our title plants constitute a principal asset 
title plants consist of copies of public records  maps  documents  previous reports  and policies indexed to specific properties in an area 
the title plants are generally located at the office which serves a particular locality or in service centers serving multiple localities in major metropolitan areas 
they enable title personnel to examine title matters relating to a specific parcel of real property as reflected in the title plant  and eliminate or reduce the need for a separate search of the public records 
they contain material dating back a number of years and are updated with the exception of certain title plants through the addition of copies of documents filed of record which affect real property 
we maintain title plants covering many of the areas in which we operate  although certain offices utilize title plants jointly owned and maintained with other title insurers 
we capitalize only the initial cost of title plants 
the cost of maintaining such plants is charged to expense as incurred 
the title plants and title examination procedures have been automated and computerized to a large extent in many areas 
on february   we entered into an agreement containing consent order the consent order with the federal trade commission the ftc in connection with the acquisition of commonwealth and transnation 
the consent order required  and we completed  the divestiture of certain title plants in localities named in the consent order 
seven of such localities were in florida  three were in michigan  and one each was in washington  dc and st 
louis  missouri 
pursuant to the terms of the consent order  we may not acquire  without prior notice to the ftc  any interest in a title plant in any of the named localities for a period of years following the date of the consent order 
we believe that our properties are maintained in good operating condition and are suitable and adequate for our purposes 
item legal proceedings general we are involved in certain litigation arising in the ordinary course of our businesses 
although the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be ascertained at this time and the results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty  we believe  based on current knowledge  that the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations

regulatory investigations and inquiries we have received certain information requests and subpoenas from various regulatory authorities relating to our business practices and the title insurance industry 
as detailed below  a number of these inquiries focus on captive reinsurance  among other matters 
captive reinsurance involves the provision of reinsurance by a reinsurance company that is owned by another entity  typically a lender  developer or other party that is a provider of real estate related services

specifically  we have received the following regulatory inquiries in  the office of the attorney general of the state of new york nyag initiated an investigation into the business practices of companies engaged in the title insurance business 
we have received subpoenas and requests from the nyag seeking information and documents related to certain industry business practices  including  among other things  competitive market practices  the compensation of title insurance agents and producers by underwriters and captive and other reinsurance arrangements  and we continued to respond to those subpoenas and requests in in addition  the insurance department of the state of new york also examined the reinsurance arrangements of transnation title insurance company of new york as part of its financial examination of that company for the fiscal year ending december  we also received initial inquiries in from  and continued to respond in to  inquiries regarding the title industry s business practices from the following state agencies the california department of insurance and the colorado division of insurance regarding captive reinsurance  the insurance departments of north carolina and pennsylvania as part of their review of competitive market practices and agent compensation in the title insurance industry  and the state of washington office of insurance commissioner regarding captive reinsurance  potential illegal inducements and rebates by title insurance companies and title insurance rates 
additionally  in  we received and responded to inquiries regarding the title industry s business practices from the following state agencies the california department of real estate regarding captive reinsurance  the california department of insurance regarding our community development and investment  california title plants  and examinations of our adherence to filed premium rates and claims handling practices  the colorado attorney general regarding captive reinsurance  the colorado department of insurance regarding affiliated business arrangements  the connecticut department of insurance regarding producer compensation and captive reinsurance arrangements  the florida department of financial services regarding affiliated business arrangements  the hawaii insurance division regarding producer compensation arrangements and captive reinsurance  the idaho department of insurance regarding captive reinsurance and premium splits between agent and underwriter  the massachusetts attorney general regarding reinsurance and the title insurance market  the minnesota department of commerce regarding captive and other reinsurance arrangements  the tennessee department of insurance regarding producer compensation arrangements and competitive market practices of title insurance company of america  and requiring the submission of an attestation regarding any finite reinsurance arrangements existing in that state  and regulatory departments from seven other states regarding captive reinsurance arrangements

in  we have received and are in the process of responding to an administrative subpoena from the minnesota department of commerce with regard to a market examination 
we also reached agreements with the insurance departments of the states of california and arizona in and virginia in to settle filed or potential claims regarding captive reinsurance and other regulatory matters  without admitting any liability 
in june  we established reserves of million to cover anticipated exposure to regulatory matters nationwide  an amount which includes the settlement with the california  arizona and virginia departments of insurance 
based on these settlements  we released million of this reserve back into earnings in fiscal year the remaining reserve at december  was approximately million 
apart from the above referenced inquiries  multiple states have announced their intent to examine pricing levels and competition in the title insurance industry  with a view to determining whether prices are too high  and if so  to implement rate reductions 
in support of these efforts  the insurance departments of the states of florida and california have issued data calls  and the nevada department of insurance has requested copies of rate manuals 
in connection with its bi annual rate hearing  the texas department of insurance has issued subpoenas and deposition questions seeking information regarding business practices  including captive reinsurance  that may have the effect of raising prices to texas consumers 
we may receive additional subpoenas and or requests for information in the future from state or federal government agencies 
we will evaluate  and we intend to cooperate in connection with  all such subpoenas and requests 
based on the information known to management at this time  it is not possible to predict the outcome of any of the governmental inquiries and investigations into the title insurance industry s market  business practices  pricing levels  and other matters described above  that are not subject to any settlement  or the market s response thereto

because we are a holding company  our ability to pay dividends will depend largely on the earnings of  and cash flow available from  our subsidiaries

for information on risks and uncertainties related to our business that may make past performance not indicative of future results  or cause actual results to differ materially from any forward looking statements made by us  see forward looking and cautionary statements  and part i  item a  risk factors 
executive overview our long term goal is to enhance our position as one of the largest providers of real estate transaction services 
to accomplish this objective  we have expanded our operations through internal growth and selective strategic acquisitions 
our business operations are organized under three primary business segments title operations  lender services and financial services 
other operating business segments not required to be reported separately are reported in a category called corporate and other 
these groupings of business operations are consistent with the way we view our business results and consistent with financial accounting standards board release no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
our dominant business operation continues to be our title operations segment which accounted for percent and percent of our operating revenue in and  respectively 
title operations our title operations segment is influenced by the level of real estate activity and the cost and availability of mortgage funds 
the demand for our title insurance products and services is dependent upon  among other things  the volume of residential and commercial real estate transactions  including mortgage refinancing transactions 
the volume of these transactions has historically been influenced by factors such as interest rates and the state of the overall economy 
for example  when interest rates are increasing or the economy is experiencing a downturn or recession  real estate activity typically declines and we experience lower revenue and profitability 
the cyclical nature of our business has caused fluctuations in revenue and profitability in the past and is expected to do so in the future 
in addition to cyclicality in our title business  we also generally experience seasonality 
in  and  our results did not follow their typical seasonal pattern due to an unusually low interest rate environment 
results for are more in line with our normal seasonality 
see cyclicality and seasonality below 
revenue from our title operations segment includes title premiums  escrow fees and fees for other ancillary services 
premiums and fees are determined both by competition and by state regulation 
in addition  revenue from our title operations segment is affected by our sales and marketing efforts 
revenue from title operations owned by us is recognized at the time the real estate transaction closes 
there can be a several month delay between the time that a title order is opened and the real estate transaction closes 
consequently  expenses may be incurred related to a direct title order in advance of revenue being recognized 
operating revenue from independent agents is recognized when we receive notification from the agent that a policy has been issued 
agent notification typically occurs later than the closing of the real estate transaction 
the delay in notification varies from year to year  from agent to agent and between regions of the country 
during  we experienced an average delay between closing and reporting by agents of approximately days 
the delay in notification by agents defers revenue recognition and may also create a lag between changes in general real estate activity and the impact of such changes on the portion of our title operations segment revenue attributable to agents 
our profit margins are affected by several factors  including the volume of real estate transactions and mortgage refinance activity  type of title policies issued and amount of liability insured 
volume is an important determinant of profitability because we  like any other real estate services company  have a significant level of fixed costs arising from personnel  occupancy costs and maintenance of title plants 
while we utilize title orders opened as a forward looking indicator of business volume  our results are impacted during times of increasing or decreasing volumes since we cannot immediately match our staffing requirements to changes in our business volumes 
the amount of liability insured is also a determinant of profitability 
because premiums are based on the face amount of the policy  larger policies generate higher premiums although expenses of issuance do not necessarily increase in proportion to policy size 
in addition  cancellations affect profitability because costs incurred both in opening and in processing orders typically are not offset by fees 
our largest expense is commissions paid to agents 
we regularly review the profitability of our agents  and adjust commission levels or cancel certain agents where profitability objectives are not being met and expand operations where acceptable levels of profitability are available 
we continually monitor our operating expenses which are the sum of salaries and employee benefits  agency commissions and other expenses exclusive of interest  amortization and certain other items as a percentage of operating revenue 
generally  title insurance claims rates are lower than other types of insurance because title insurance policies insure against prior events affecting the quality of real estate titles rather than against unforeseen  and therefore less predictable  future events 
see critical accounting estimates policy and contract claims below for further discussion 
in addition  we may be subject to claims and litigation other than in the ordinary course of business 
in  we settled certain outstanding litigation resulting in a charge to earnings of approximately million in the second quarter 
in  we received requests for information and subpoenas from certain states seeking information relating to investigations of our business practices and the title insurance industry 
multiple states are specifically investigating captive reinsurance 
in june  we established reserves of million to cover anticipated exposure to regulatory matters nationwide  an amount which includes the settlement with the california  arizona and virginia departments of insurance 
based on these settlements  we released million of this reserve back into earnings in fiscal the remaining reserve at december  was approximately million 
we may receive additional requests for information and or subpoenas in the future 
we expect to cooperate with all such requests or subpoenas 
state investigations may pose a significant challenge in for a discussion of pending material legal proceedings  including regulatory investigations and inquiries  see item legal proceedings 
operating revenue in increased percent over which reflected increased revenue achieved through acquisitions and higher levels of buy sell activity partially offset by reduced refinance activity 
operating revenue in benefited from record setting levels of commercial activity 
for fiscal year  we expect interest rates to rise and growth to continue through acquisitions  however  as interest rates rise  the volume of refinance activity is expected to continue to decline consistent with the cyclical nature of the title insurance business 
buy sell activity is expected to remain fairly stable 
to counter this trend  we will continue our sales enhancement process to spur organic sales growth 
the sales process trains our sales personnel to effectively market our title insurance and related products and services to our customers 
operating results for the years ended through should not be viewed as indicative of results for any future period 
we continually evaluate our cost structure in relation to anticipated changes in business levels 
in response to declining mortgage volumes  we implemented a cost reduction program begun in the fourth quarter of aimed at reducing staffing and cost levels within existing operations to a level more consistent with anticipated transaction volumes 
as a result  in the first quarter of  we announced plans to further reduce our cost structure within existing operations by at least million on an annualized basis 
at june   we had implemented reductions to achieve at least the targeted cost savings 
although our staffing and cost levels were reduced as a result of the aforementioned plans  we saw an overall increase in salaries and employee benefits and general and administrative expenses during and during  the increases were primarily due to our acquisitions 
during  the increase in salaries and employee benefits was attributable to the increase in business volume and the increase in general and administrative expenses was due to legal and settlement costs discussed above 
in  we will continue our evaluation and integration of acquisitions 
we completed three acquisitions in the title operations segment during and will evaluate potential acquisition opportunities as they arise 
lender services our lender services segment provides services to regional and national lending institutions which complement those offered in our title insurance business 
these services consist primarily of real estate tax processing and flood zone certifications  consumer mortgage credit reporting  default management services  and mortgage loan subservicing 
with the exception of a portion of default management  the services provided by this segment are the result of businesses acquired by us during and in august  we initially entered the credit information business for the mortgage lending industry through our acquisition of info holding company  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of lacs 
in october  we entered the business of providing flood certification and real estate tax services to mortgage lenders by purchasing latf  one of the largest tax and flood service companies in the united states 
in december  we purchased loancare  a mortgage loan subservicer 
in addition  during  we expanded the national scope of our businesses in these areas through the purchase of one flood certification business  four credit reporting businesses and one default management business 
the lender services segment currently realizes approximately half of its reported revenue through service revenue associated with tracking and reporting of real estate tax payments and flood zone certifications related to mortgage loans for lending institutions 
our servicing agreements typically call for us to service the mortgage loan until cancellation or sale 
the lenders pay for these services at the time they add a loan to their servicing portfolio 
we defer a significant portion of the revenue received for these services to account for the life of loan servicing aspects of the contracts 
as a result  revenue reported in the financial statements represents the amortization of both current and prior service fees and is not representative of new contract sales levels 
expenses on the other hand are charged to the income statement as incurred and are not deferred 
thus  an understanding of the levels of deferred revenue or new contract cash received in this area is critical to understanding the relative strength of the underlying business related to tax and flood services 
the estimated life of loans is reviewed regularly to determine if there have been changes in contract lives and or changes in the number or timing of prepayments  and adjusted to reflect current trends 
we are required in certain instances to reimburse part of the fees should the lender sell the loan to another party 
see further discussion in critical accounting estimates below 
revenue in mortgage credit reporting  default management services and loan subservicing are recognized when the report or service is delivered to the customer 
the lender services segment has the opportunity to leverage our title operations segment business relationships to cross sell services to other financial institutions 
a significant challenge for these businesses is their integration into our overall structure without jeopardizing their current business relationships 
during we began offering a bundled product solution  primarily to our national lender customers  which includes products offered by the title operations segment and businesses included in lender services 
we expect to continue expanding organically and by acquisition in this segment and to focus on the realization of cross selling opportunities 
during  we made significant improvements to the sales and account management process to help client generation and retention activities 
for example  we consolidated our sales force from five independent groups to two one targeting servicing relationships  and the other origination relationships 
we believe this change will leverage our top sales executives over a wider product set  and result in a stronger and more robust sales effort 
financial services the business reported in this segment includes centennial  a california industrial bank acquisition we made in november centennial s primary business is the origination and bulk purchase of commercial real estate loans in the southern california market and is dependent on the viability of the commercial real estate market in southern california 
deposits are solicited through the internet for both certificates of deposit and passbook savings accounts 
as an industrial bank  centennial does not accept demand deposits  such as checking accounts  that provide for payment to third parties 
centennial does not offer banking services such as credit cards or automated teller machines 
we utilize centennial to hold a portion of our escrow deposits 
we anticipate expanding our utilization of centennial to facilitate escrow balance transactions 
corporate and other this group includes businesses that are not significant enough in size to be reported as separate segments as well as the unallocated portion of the corporate expenses related to our corporate offices in richmond  virginia and unallocated interest expense 
the businesses reported in this group provide commercial and residential inspections  commercial appraisals  valuations and due diligence services  and home warranties 
our assessment business is managed by landamerica assessment corporation  our subsidiary that was acquired in  and is headquartered in california 
this business provides due diligence services to commercial customers throughout the united states  canada  mexico  the caribbean and europe 
revenue is recognized upon completion of the services to the customer 
our commercial and residential inspection services are run by our subsidiary landamerica property inspection services  inc  formerly known as inspectech  inc this business is highly dependent on the real estate industry and the levels of residential home sales and refinancing transactions 
a flat fee is charged for each transaction which is generally collected at the time of service 
our commercial appraisal and valuation operation is run by our subsidiary landamerica valuation corporation  formerly known as landamerica commercial appraisal corporation 
this business is highly dependent on the commercial real estate market 
a fee is charged based on the type and complexity of work performed 
in september  we purchased bhw  headquartered in california  which provides and services home warranty contracts in california  texas  arizona  colorado  nevada  new mexico  and oklahoma 
fees charged by this business are deferred upon receipt and amortized over the life of the underlying contract which is generally one year 
critical accounting estimates this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our accompanying consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
we consider the following accounting estimates to be critical in preparing and understanding such statements 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
significant accounting policies are disclosed in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
policy and contract claims our recorded liability for claim losses includes reserves for known claims and for losses that have been incurred but have not yet been reported  net of recoveries 
reserves for known claims include the estimated amount of the claim and the costs required to settle the claim 
a provision for estimated claims that are incurred but not yet reported is established at the time premium revenue is recognized based on reported claims  historical loss experience and other factors  including industry trends 
provisions for title losses as a percentage of title operating revenues were percent for  percent for  and percent for a change of percent in this percentage would have changed the provision for title losses and pretax earnings by approximately million for the year ended december  we review our loss provision rates periodically and adjust as experience develops or new information becomes known 
claims payment experience has historically extended for more than years after the issuance of a policy 
due to the length of time over which claim payments are made and regularly occurring changes in underlying economic conditions  these estimates are subject to variability 
our independent actuaries perform projections of required reserves at year end and as considered necessary during the year 
these projections are compared to recorded reserves to evaluate the adequacy of such recorded reserves and any necessary adjustments are included in current expenses 
purchase accounting and goodwill and long lived assets valuations during the years ended december  and  we completed and acquisitions  respectively 
these acquisitions were intended to grow our title operations and expand our real estate transaction services portfolio 
as a result of these acquisitions  we assigned fair values to the assets and liabilities purchased and increased the amount of goodwill and other intangibles recorded on our balance sheet 
we utilize the services of an independent appraisal company to assist with the allocation of purchase price to acquired assets including goodwill and liabilities 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangibles  which required that we discontinue amortizing goodwill and begin assessing the recoverability of goodwill for each of our reporting units 
reporting units are business components of an operating segment  and goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit which benefits from the synergies arising from each business acquisition 
we test for the recoverability of goodwill annually or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of our reporting units  including goodwill  may exceed their fair values 
the fair value of the reporting units is determined using cash flow analysis which projects the future cash flows produced by the reporting units and discounts those cash flows to the present value 
the projection of future cash flows is necessarily dependent upon assumptions on the future levels of income as well as business trends  prospects and market and economic conditions 
when the fair value is less than the carrying value for the net assets of the reporting unit  including goodwill  impairment loss may be charged to operations 
based on our annual analysis  no impairment was identified for the year ending december  our intangible assets primarily include capitalized customer relations and non competition arrangements which are amortized over their useful lives 
pursuant to sfas no 
 tests for impairment must be performed for intangible assets that are amortizable with definite lives if conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
such conditions may include a loss of a significant customer or a change in the assessment of future operations 
during  latf ceased providing future tax services in two states  california and colorado  for one of its largest tax and flood customers 
as a result of the loss of business  we conducted an impairment test of latf s long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  using estimated future cash flows 
we determined that latf s customer relationship intangible was impaired by million  which has been reflected in our results of operations for the year ended december  see further details in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we also review the status of our title plants at least annually 
as a result of these reviews  we periodically determine that a title plant will no longer be used or has been abandoned at which time we take a charge to earnings 
during  we identified title plants in the title operations segment with an aggregate book value of million that will not continue to be used or maintained 
accordingly  we recorded an impairment loss of million  which is reflected in write off of intangible and other long lived assets in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
there were no material impairments of title plants identified in we anticipate that additional charges in future periods may be taken as state and local courts and municipalities continue to automate their property records and make them available through electronic media 
deferred tax assets many deductions for tax return purposes cannot be taken until the expenses are actually paid  rather than when the expenses are recorded under generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
in these circumstances  under gaap  we accrue for the tax benefit expected to be received in future years if  in our judgment  it is more likely than not that we will receive such benefits 
the most significant factor in this determination is the projected future timing and amounts of taxable income 
if we determine that it is no longer more likely than not that an asset will be utilized  we would record a valuation allowance which would reduce net income in the period recorded 
deferred tax assets created from tax benefits expected to be realized at december  and relate primarily to policy and contract claims  goodwill  pension liability  deferred service arrangements  allowance for doubtful accounts  employee benefit plans  tax and flood claims and convertible debt offset by deferred tax liabilities primarily related to other intangibles  unrealized gains on our investment portfolio  title plants  fixed assets and capitalized system development software 
based upon our historical results of operations  our existing financial condition and our assessment of all other available evidence  we believe that these assets will more likely than not be realized 
see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
pension and other postretirement benefits we have pension and other retirement benefit plans covering a portion of our employees 
these plans are valued annually by an actuary who employs significant assumptions that are particularly important when determining our projected liabilities for pension and other postretirement benefits 
payments related to these benefits will be made by us over a lengthy period and the projected liability will be impacted by assumptions which include inflation  investment returns and market interest rates  changes in the benefit obligations and laws and regulations covering the benefit obligations 
one significant assumption is the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
a lower expected return on plan assets increases the amount of pension expense 
the use of expected long term rates of return may result in recognized returns that are greater or less than actual returns in any given year 
over time the expected returns are used to approximate actual long term returns which result in a pattern of expense recognition that more closely matches the service lives of typical employees 
we use long term and actual historical returns  current and targeted asset mix and future estimates of long term investment returns to develop our long term return for plan assets 
our anticipated rate of return was percent as of the valuation date 
another significant assumption in valuing the pension liability is the discount rate 
in general  the liability increases as the discount rate decreases and conversely  the liability decreases as the discount rate increases 
the discount rate utilized is based on rates on high quality fixed income debt instruments available at the end of each valuation period 
we utilized a discount rate of percent in determining our benefit obligations 
changing the discount rate or long term rate of return would result in the following impact on the pension benefit liability projected benefit obligation in millions increase of in discount rate decrease of in discount rate additionally  assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the other postretirement benefits 
a one percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects one percentage point increase one percentage point decrease in millions effect on total of service and interest cost effect on postretirement benefit obligation effective december   we ceased future accruals to the retirement plan accounts of all plan participants in our cash balance pension plan the plan  other than annual interest credits on account balances  which caused the accrued benefits of participants to be fully vested as of december  and limited participation in the plan to those individuals who were participants of december  these were conforming changes to our benefit restoration plan 
see further information in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
as a result of the change  we adopted curtailment accounting for the plan as specified under fas no 
the curtailment resulted in a one time gain of approximately million and increased the minimum pension liability by million at december  deferred service arrangements when we acquired the tax and flood and home warranty companies  all of their assets and liabilities were adjusted to fair value in accordance with purchase method accounting 
in making these adjustments  each entity s deferred revenue account  representing amounts which had been deferred and would have been amortized over the remaining lives of the contracts for the provision of real estate tax monitoring  flood certification services  and home warranty services existing at the acquisition date  was eliminated 
the deferred revenue account was replaced with an account called deferred service obligations representing the estimated fair value of the obligation to provide the required services over the remaining life of the subject contracts 
this account  established as of the acquisition date  is being amortized over the remaining lives of existing contracts 
as previously noted  real estate tax monitoring  flood certification fees  and home warranty service fees received on new contracts entered into since the acquisition dates are deferred and amortized over the estimated lives of the contracts to which they relate 
the sum of amortization of the initial deferred service obligation and amortization related to fees accrued on new contracts represent the earned fee amount for the period 
the estimated remaining contractual life for real estate tax monitoring services and flood certification services can vary depending on a number of factors  including but not limited to  type of loan  lender  credit quality of the borrower  interest rates  and portfolio turnover 
we evaluate the portfolio of loans under service quarterly to determine the appropriate portfolio life for loans under service 
an increase decrease of six months in the average service life for all loans serviced would result in the following approximate changes to revenue recognized for real estate tax and flood monitoring revenue revenue recognized in millions increase of months decrease of months cyclicality and seasonality the title insurance business is closely related to the overall level of residential and commercial real estate activity  which is generally affected by the relative strength or weakness of the united states economy 
in addition  title insurance volumes fluctuate based on the effect that changes in interest rates have on the level of real estate activity 
periods of increasing interest rates usually have an adverse impact on real estate activity and therefore premium and fee revenue 
in contrast  real estate activity usually increases when interest rates fall 
during  interest rates continued to remain at relatively low levels in comparison to interest rates in the united states over the past three years 
prior to  residential real estate activity has been generally slower in the winter  when fewer families buy or sell homes  with increased volumes in the spring and summer 
residential refinancing activity is generally more uniform throughout the seasons  but is subject to interest rate variability 
we typically report our lowest revenue in the first quarter  with revenue increasing into the second quarter and through the third quarter 
the fourth quarter customarily may be as strong as the third quarter  depending on the level of activity in the commercial real estate market 
due to an unusually low interest rate environment in the last three years  our results have not followed the typical seasonal patterns 
in  and  our fourth quarter revenue was stronger than the third quarter 
in and  this increase was primarily due to an increase in commercial real estate activity and refinance activity 
in  the increase in fourth quarter revenue was due to an increase in commercial real estate activity and in other direct revenue 
revenue for was more in line with our typical historical results 
portions of our lender services segment have seasonal trends similar to our title operations segment  particularly in our tax and flood and credit servicing businesses 
however  due to the nature of the revenue deferrals made in this segment  as noted above  the impact on our results of operations will differ 
in instances where we receive cash in advance for services for real estate tax payment and flood certification services  the revenue is deferred and amortized ratably over the anticipated life of the loan servicing 
this ratable amortization has the impact of reducing the volatility in revenue related to this segment  however  loss of a customer may accelerate recognition of revenue in certain periods resulting in one time volatility

results of operations operating revenue a summary of our operating revenue at december   and is as follows dollars in millions title operations direct operations agency operations lender services financial services corporate and other total title operations operating revenue from direct title operations increased million  or percent  in over acquisitions completed during and contributed approximately million to the increase in operating revenue from direct operations for during  we continued to experience strong commercial and buy sell activity 
title insurance revenue from commercial operations  which we have typically defined as being premiums from policies providing coverage over million in liability  was million for  an increase of percent over refinance activity was lower year over year due to moderate increases in the interest rate environment in closed orders from direct title operations were  in with an average fee per closed order which includes title insurance premiums and other revenue related to completed transactions by direct operations of approximately  compared to  in with an average fee per closed order of approximately  closed orders from acquisitions were approximately  in before the impact of acquisitions  the decrease in the number of title policies issued by our direct operations in was due to lower refinance transactions as compared to the reduction in refinancing transactions shifted the mix of business toward fewer refinancing title polices  which tend to have lower premiums per policy  and more purchase title policies which tend to have higher premiums per policy 
in addition  the increase in commercial activity and increases in home prices also served to increase the average fee per closed order in operating revenue from agency title operations increased by million  or percent  in compared to this increase was due to growth in the agency business  particularly in certain southeastern and northeastern markets  partially offset by acquisitions of title agencies reflected as direct revenue in the first half of and reduced levels of refinancing activity 
an additional factor is the timing in the reporting of transactions by agents 
the timing of policy reporting  and therefore revenue reporting by agents  varies from year to year  from agent to agent and between regions of the country 
operating revenue from direct title operations increased million  or percent in over acquisitions completed during and in this segment contributed million in over before the impact of acquisitions  increased levels of commercial activity were more than offset by a reduction in residential refinancing transactions 
closed orders from direct title operations were  and  during and  respectively 
the reduction in refinancing transactions in resulted in a decrease in the number of title policies issued by our direct operations compared to the average fee per closed order in was approximately  compared to an average fee per closed order in of approximately  closed orders from acquisitions completed during and were approximately  in the reduction in refinancing transactions changed the mix of business toward fewer refinancing title policies and more purchase title policies  which have more revenue per policy associated with them 
in addition  the increase in commercial activity also served to increase the average fee per closed order in operating revenue from agency title operations decreased by percent in compared to this decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in refinancing activity discussed above 
an additional factor is the timing in the reporting of transactions by agents 
the timing of policy reporting  and therefore revenue reporting  by agents  varies from year to year  from agent to agent and between regions of the country 
we anticipate that title operations segment revenue will decrease in from levels due to expected lower refinance and home purchase activity resulting from anticipated higher interest rates 
lender services operating revenue in the lender services segment increased million  or percent in compared to acquisitions completed during contributed approximately million to the increase in operating revenue for the real estate tax processing and flood zone certification business receives cash in advance to provide service over the life of the loan 
we are required to defer a significant portion of the revenue received for these services over the anticipated service life of contracts 
as a result  revenue reported in the financial statements represents the amortization of both current and prior service fees 
in  real estate tax processing and flood certification services revenue was made up of gross receipts of million  reduced by deferred recognition of revenue for million of these receipts and increased by the recognition into revenue of approximately million of our previously deferred service arrangements 
when customers terminate their contracts early  the deferred revenue related to those contracts is recognized immediately 
the recognition of deferred revenue from terminated tax servicing contracts in our tax and flood business contributed approximately million to the increase in operating revenue for the service life of our portfolio has not significantly increased compared to the expected service life of the portfolio increases with an increasing mortgage interest rate environment because loans tend to be outstanding longer in periods when interest rates increase 
this reduces the amount of deferred service arrangements that is amortized into revenue for each period on our life of loan products 
if interest rates vary from the current expected trend  the estimated service life is expected to increase or decrease inversely to changes in interest rates 
in addition  operating revenue for was negatively impacted by lower volume in the credit services and tax and flood businesses as a result of the loss  of certain customers partially offset by increased volume in the default services business 
operating revenue in the lender services segment increased million  or percent in compared to this increase was primarily driven by the purchase of our tax and flood business  latf  in october  and the purchase of our credit services business lacs in august our tax and flood revenue increased million in over revenue from our credit services business increased million in over reflecting a full year of operating revenue from our original acquisition in august and the impact of acquisitions we made to this business in in  our real estate tax processing and flood certification services revenue was made up of gross receipts of million  reduced by deferred recognition of revenue for million of these receipts and increased by the recognition into revenue of approximately million of our previously deferred service arrangements 
the service life of our portfolio increased percent compared to corporate and other operating revenue in corporate and other increased by approximately million  or percent  from over acquisitions completed during and contributed approximately million to the increase in operating revenue in before the impact of these acquisitions  operating revenue increased due to stronger volume in the home warranty  commercial appraisal and assessment businesses 
operating revenue in corporate and other increased by approximately million  or percent  from over the increase in revenue in over is primarily due to the acquisitions in residential inspection  commercial appraisal and assessment and home warranty businesses 
investment and other income investment and other income was million in  million in and million in investment and other income increased million  or percent  in compared to the financial services segment generated million of additional investment income during compared to  which was due to higher balances in the portfolio of loans receivable and investments and higher returns 
the remaining increase in investment and other income was due to increased yields and higher invested balances in our remaining investment portfolio 
investment and other income increased million  or percent  in compared to and is primarily due to the acquisition of centennial in december which resulted in increased interest income of million in our investment earnings are primarily derived from our fixed maturity securities as well as loans receivable related to centennial 
we anticipate that investment and other income will increase in over due to higher loan balances  increased deposits of our escrow accounts at centennial and higher interest rates 
net realized investment gains net realized investment gains totaled million in  million in and million in the decrease in net realized investment gains from to was primarily due to higher interest rates and repositioning of our investment portfolio toward equity securities and responding to market changes 
the decrease in net realized investment gains from to was primarily due to the timing of the repositioning of a portion of our investments to fund  in part  the acquisitions of latf and lacs 
agents commissions a summary of agents commissions and related revenue in the title operations segment is as follows dollars in millions agents commissions agent revenue retained by agents the commission rate paid to agents varies by geographic area in which the commission was paid and by individual agent agreement 
during  we experienced an increase in agency revenue concentrated in states where the agency commission rates are lower than our average rate 
salaries and employee benefits a summary of our salaries and employee benefits expenses is as follows dollars in millions title operations lender services financial services corporate and other total title operations our title operations segment accounted for approximately percent of our total salaries and other personnel expenses in in particular  the non agency or direct operations portion of the title operations segment is labor intensive and  as a result  salaries and employee benefits are a significant component of variable expense for this segment 
we manage personnel expenses to reflect changes in the level of activity in the real estate market 
as a result  our employee base expands and contracts over time 
in order to manage personnel costs more effectively throughout the real estate cycle  we use temporary or part time employees where appropriate to staff operations so that we can respond promptly to changes in real estate activity 
we continuously monitor personnel levels in connection with changes in real estate transaction volumes 
depending on the speed and severity of change in real estate activity  we may not be able in the short run to match decreasing levels of title orders with reduced staffing levels 
as a result  in periods of declining activity  personnel costs as a percentage of revenue  may increase 
salaries and employee benefit expenses in the title operations segment increased million  or percent  in over the addition of personnel as the result of acquisitions completed during and increased salary and employee benefit expenses by million for before the impact of these acquisitions  increased salary and employee benefit expenses in primarily related to compensation increases associated with the increase in operating revenue and increased staffing as a result of higher commercial and buy sell activity which is more labor intensive than refinance activity 
average full time equivalent fte counts were  including related to acquisitions in versus  including  related to acquisitions in the increase in ftes was as a result of increased buy sell and commercial transactions year over year which tend to be more labor intensive than refinance transactions 
title operations salaries and employee benefit expenses increased by million  or percent  in over the addition of personnel as the result of acquisitions was million for  offset by reduced staffing levels in other operations from lower business volume 
additionally  there was a net increase of million in pension and postretirement benefit expenses 
for additional information regarding the impact of our pension plans on results of operations  see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
average fte counts were  in including  related to acquisitions that year versus  in lender services lender services personnel costs tend to increase during periods of increased sales volume and decrease when sales volume is lower 
this is the case because a significant amount of work is required to set up new accounts 
once accounts are established  monitoring and maintenance activities are less labor intensive 
salaries and employee benefit expenses in the lender services segment increased million  or percent in acquisitions completed during contributed approximately million to the increase during before the impact of these acquisitions  salaries and employee benefit expenses decreased due to reductions in fte counts in the credit services and tax and flood businesses as a result of lower business volumes partially offset by increased ftes in the default services business 
salaries and employee benefit expenses increased million  or percent in over due to acquisitions made in and early financial services salary and employee benefit expenses for the financial services segment were essentially flat from to financial services salaries and benefit expenses increased million in over due to our acquisition of centennial in december corporate and other salary and employee benefit expenses for the corporate and other segment increased million  or percent  in over incremental salary and employee benefit expenses from acquisitions completed during and were approximately million in salaries and benefit expenses increased million in  or percent  over approximately half of the increase  or million  was related to acquisitions  with the remainder due to increases at the corporate operations level due to continued infrastructure growth and compliance with the sarbanes oxley act 
provision for title policy and contract claims the provision for title policy and contract claims includes an estimate of known and anticipated claims 
a provision for estimated claims that are incurred but not yet reported is established at the time premium revenue is recognized based on reported claims  historical loss experience and other factors  including industry trends 
provisions for title losses as a percentage of title operating revenues were percent for  percent for  and percent for the loss percentage increase in compared to the loss percentage in reflects a higher estimated loss rate for the policy year and the negative impact of two large claims totaling approximately million  partially offset by a favorable adjustment to prior year loss reserves 
in  a favorable adjustment to the loss rate was attributable to a favorable adjustment to prior year loss reserves 
the prior year favorable adjustments in and resulted from lower than expected payment levels on policies issued in prior years that included a high proportion of refinance business 
adverse development on prior year loss reserves during was attributable to a few large claims 
we review our loss provision rates periodically and adjust the rates as experience develops or new information becomes known 
write off of intangible and other long lived assets in  we wrote off a portion of the customer relationship intangible related to the acquisition of our tax and flood business in and a non solicitation intangible related to one of our title acquisitions 
for further details  see note  impairment and exit and termination charges to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we identified title plants in and title plants and that will not continue to be used or maintained 
as a result  we took charges to earnings of million in and million in to reflect the diminution in value associated with these plants 
we did not have any material charges related to title plants in we anticipate that a result of the trend toward automation of property records by municipalities and courts  we will continue to record charges related to diminution of value of our title plants in future periods 
exit and termination costs there were no significant exit and termination costs in see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in the first quarter of  we announced plans to reduce our cost structure by at least million on an annualized basis within existing operations 
as a result of this initiative  we identified offices that we would consolidate into other offices during we accrued million for the facility downsizing costs of these offices in as well as million in severance payments related to these office consolidations 
in  we consolidated certain office space 
we incurred charges of approximately million in the fourth quarter of related to our decision to consolidate office space in two markets 
this charge was offset by a reduction of million related to the accrual 
amortization amortization expense increased by million in compared to and million in compared to these increases were the result of acquisitions by us in and acquired businesses added million to amortizable intangible assets in and million in we are amortizing the intangible assets acquired as part of these businesses over their estimated useful lives 
interest expense interest expense increased by million in over and by million in over the increase in interest expense in was due to increases in interest bearing deposits and borrowings at centennial and convertible debt issued in may the increase in interest expense in was related to our acquisition of centennial in december of million and the remainder of the increase in was related to our issuance in november of million of our percent senior convertible debentures due used to fund a portion of the acquisitions in and our issuance of million of our percent senior convertible debentures due issued in may used in part to repay amounts borrowed to fund our acquisition of county title holding corp  the parent company of southland title corporation 
premium taxes insurers are generally not subject to state income or franchise taxes 
they are  however  subject to a premium tax on certain operating revenue  depending on the state 
tax rates and the amounts that are subject to tax vary from state to state 
premium taxes as a percentage of total title insurance revenue remained relatively constant during the last three years 
this percentage was percent for  percent for and percent for general  administrative and other a summary of general  administrative and other expenses is as follows dollars in millions title operations lender services financial services corporate and other total title operations general and administrative expenses for the title operations segment increased by million or percent in compared to incremental costs from acquisitions completed during and contributed million of the increase in before the impact of these acquisitions  the increase in general and administrative expenses for was due to increased order volume and increased legal costs of million 
the increased legal costs included previously announced charges for legal reserves for regulatory matters of million 
general and administrative expenses for the title operations segment increased by million or percent in as compared to this increase is primarily related to acquisitions that occurred during early and of million and legal settlements of million  partially offset by lower costs associated with lower business volumes 
lender services general and administrative expenses for the lender services segment increased million  or percent  in from and million  or percent in from before the impact of acquisitions completed during  general and administrative expenses decreased percent in over as a result of lower business volumes 
the increase in general and administrative expenses in over was primarily due to the purchase of latf and lacs in financial services general and administrative expenses for the financial services segment decreased by million in from and increased million in from due to the acquisition of centennial in november corporate and other general and administrative expenses in the corporate and other segment increased by million  or percent  in from the increase in these expenses is primarily related to the impact of acquisitions completed during and and increased expenses associated with higher volume in the commercial appraisal and assessment businesses 
general and administrative expenses increased by million  or percent  in from the increase in these expenses is primarily related to the impact of acquisitions completed during and operating income title operations the title operations segment reported pretax income of million in  million in  and million in pretax income in this segment from compared to was positively impacted by increased operating revenue from higher buy sell and commercial volumes and from our growth through acquisitions during and these increases were partially offset by increases in litigation costs 
pretax income in this segment from compared to was positively impacted by growth through acquisitions during offset by increases in litigation  and personnel and administrative costs 
personnel and administrative costs did not decrease as rapidly as transaction volumes decreased due both to our inability to reduce headcount in proportion to volume changes and the acquisitions of agents throughout and during the latter portion of additionally  the title operations segment reported reduced income in from its investment portfolio due primarily to the liquidation of securities in the third quarter to fund in part the acquisition of latf and lacs 
see net realized investment gains on page lender services the lender services segment had pretax income loss of million in  million in and million in pretax loss in reflects the write off of a portion of the customer relationship intangible related to the acquisition of our tax and flood business partially offset by acceleration of deferred revenue 
pretax loss income in and was impacted by the acquisitions made in the third and fourth quarters of we evaluate the results of our lender services segment on the basis of pretax income before net revenue deferrals and amortization prbda 
adjusted operating revenue represents operating revenue adjusted for the impact of net revenue deferrals 
prbda margin represents prbda divided by operating revenue adjusted for net revenue deferrals 
prbda and prbda margin are not measures of performance defined by gaap and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for operating income or cash flows provided by operating activities  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
prbda and prbda margin  as presented  may not be comparable to the calculation of similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
we believe that prbda and prbda margins provide useful information to investors because they are indicators of operating and cash flow performance for those businesses where we have life of loan servicing requirements  which have been burdened in the short run with amortization expense related to intangibles acquired with the businesses 
while amortization expense is an operating expense under gaap  this expense represents the non current allocation of intangible assets acquired in prior periods 
additionally  while net revenue deferrals are a reduction of revenue and profits in the current period  these reductions represent a non cash allocation of revenue to future periods for ongoing monitoring of certain of our flood and tax servicing products 
reconciliations of these financial measures to lender services operating results are as follows december  dollars in millions operating revenue add net revenue deferrals adjusted operating revenue operating income before taxes change in net revenue deferrals add back amortization expense write off of intangible and other long lived assets prbda prdba to adjusted operating revenue margin financial services the financial services segment reported pretax income of million in  million in and million in the increase in pretax income from to was due to growth in the loans receivable and investment portfolios  which exceeded the increase in interest bearing liabilities 
the increase in pretax income from to was due to the purchase of centennial in november corporate and other the corporate and other segment reported pretax losses of million in  million in and million in the corporate and other segment includes unallocated corporate expenses and our home warranty  residential inspection  and commercial appraisal and assessment businesses 
the decrease in pretax losses from to was primarily due to the impact of acquisitions completed during and the increase in pretax losses from to was due to increased interest expense as a result of debt issuances in may and november and due to increased salary and employee benefit expenses from infrastructure growth and compliance with the sarbanes oxley act 
income taxes our effective income tax rate  which includes a provision for state income and franchise taxes for non insurance subsidiaries  was percent for  percent for and percent for the differences in the effective tax rate were primarily due to changes in the ratio of permanent differences to income before taxes and the mix of state taxes related to our non insurance subsidiaries 
net income we reported net income for of million or per share on a diluted basis  compared to million  or per share on a diluted basis  for  and million  or per share on a diluted basis  for adjusted net income for was million  or per share on a diluted basis  compared to million for  or per share on a diluted basis  and million for  or per share on a diluted basis 
to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a gaap basis  we use additional non gaap measures of operating revenue  income before income taxes  net income  and earnings per common share assuming dilution  adjusted to exclude certain costs  expenses  gains or losses we believe appropriate to enhance an overall understanding of our past financial performance and also our prospects for the future 
these adjustments to our gaap results are made with the intent of providing both management and investors a more complete understanding of our underlying operational results and trends and our marketplace performance 
in addition  these non gaap results are among the primary indicators management uses as a basis for planning and forecasting future periods 
adjusted operating revenue  income before income taxes  adjusted net income  and adjusted earnings per common share assuming dilution are not measures of performance defined by gaap and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for operating revenue  income before income taxes  net income  or earnings per common share assuming dilution  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
reconciliations of these financial measures to consolidated operating results are as follows reconciliation of non gaap measures years ended december  restated restated in millions  except per share data operating revenue  as reported deduct recognition of deferred income adjusted operating revenue income before income taxes  as reported add back write off of intangible and other long lived assets regulatory legal reserve settlement of class action suit deduct recognition of deferred income adjusted income before income taxes net income  as reported add back write off of intangible and other long lived assets regulatory legal reserve settlement of class action suit deduct recognition of deferred income adjusted net income net income per common share assuming dilution  as reported add back write off of intangible and other long lived assets regulatory legal reserve settlement of class action suit deduct recognition of deferred income adjusted net income per common share assuming dilution liquidity and capital resources cash provided by operating activities for  and  respectively  was million  million and million 
the principal non operating uses of cash and cash equivalents for  and were acquisitions  capital expenditures  additions to the investment portfolio and loans receivable  stock repurchases and the repayment of debt 
the principal non operating sources of cash were proceeds from our investment portfolio and deposits in  the issuance in of our million percent senior convertible debentures due  the issuance in of our million percent convertible senior debentures due together  the convertible debentures and the proceeds from the sales and maturities of certain investments 
the net of all activities was to increase cash by million  million and million for  and  respectively 
as of december   we held cash of million and investments of  million 
as noted above  our operating results and cash flows are heavily dependent on the real estate market  particularly in the title operations segment 
while we have continued to diversify our products and services portfolio over the last several years  a significant downturn in the real estate market would adversely impact our cash flows 
our business is labor intensive 
changes to the real estate market are monitored closely  and staffing levels are adjusted accordingly 
there is typically a lag between changes in the real estate market and changes in personnel levels resulting in higher personnel costs in periods where the real estate market declines in advance of headcount reductions 
the lender services segment provides real estate tax payment and flood certification services for the life of loans for which we receive cash at loan closing 
this revenue related to the long term servicing is deferred and amortized over the life of the loan 
as a result  our cash flows in the lender services segment are greater than reported earnings 
revenue  cash receipts and loans in our financial services segment are dependent on the ability of the bank to attract deposits and qualified commercial customers 
we believe that our product diversification efforts along with our management of operating expenses and significant working capital position will aid our ability to manage cash resources through declines in the real estate market 
we do not match maturities of our investments with anticipated claims payments  which may result in our having periods in which cash flows from operations are positively or negatively impacted by the difference between the liability for claims being established and the actual payment stream 
as opposed to insurance companies where claims account for a substantial portion of premiums  our title insurance claims typically average approximately percent to percent of title insurance operating revenue 
additionally  the time period in which we are liable for a claim is long  with potential claims being paid over years after a title policy is issued and the timing of claims payments may vary from period to period 
over the past several years  exclusive of our operating cash flows  our investment income returns plus maturities of fixed obligation securities have resulted in a maturity and investment income to claims payment ratio in excess of two times 
we consider our investment portfolio as available for sale 
we review the status of each security quarterly to determine whether an other than temporary impairment otti has occurred 
our criteria include whether the fair value of the security is less than percent of its amortized cost  the investment grade of the security and how long the security has been in an unrealized loss position 
all of our securities that have had an unrealized loss in excess of year are investment grade  long term bonds that we have the ability and intent to hold to recovery 
consequently  we recorded no otti loss in or we slowed our acquisition pace in compared to the two previous years 
we focused on deepening rather than broadening our service offerings and completed only three acquisitions with an aggregate purchase price of approximately million in new title operations and six acquisitions with an aggregate purchase price of approximately million in expanded services 
the purchases were funded through a mixture of cash  invested cash and investments 
we will continue to selectively evaluate additional acquisitions should attractive candidates be identified 
in and  we issued convertible senior debentures totaling million and million  respectively 
these debentures are convertible only upon the occurrence of certain events  which we currently view as remote 
in february  we made an irrevocable election under the terms of our debentures to satisfy in cash percent of the principal amount of the debentures converted after february  prior to the election  we had the ability to make payment upon conversion for the principal amount of the debentures in cash or shares of our common stock 
in  certain senior notes will mature in august it is our intention to refinance these notes at prevailing market rates 
in  we amended our employee retirement savings plans 
the changes to our employee retirement savings program included amendments to the plan effective december  to cease future accruals to the retirement plan accounts of all plan participants other than annual interest credits on account balances  to cause the accrued benefits of participants to be fully vested as of december  and to limit participation in the plan to those individuals who were participants as of december  there were conforming changes to our benefit restoration plan 
amendments to our savings and stock ownership plan effective january  to comply with the safe harbor provisions of sections k and m of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
the amendment provided immediate vesting on all of our matching contributions made after january   removed the one year waiting period for new participants to receive matching contributions and increased the matching contributions that we will make to employee accounts under the plan 
adoption of a new employee stock purchase plan was approved by our shareholders at the annual meeting of shareholders and became effective july  the plan replaced our previous employee stock purchase plan and permits employees to purchase stock at a discount of percent of the fair market value of our common stock 
the plan initially authorizes the purchase of  shares of our common stock 
based on these changes  we anticipate a reduction in company wide pension expense of approximately million in we anticipate a contribution of between million and million to the plan in additionally  we anticipate that our contribution requirements after will decline 
the board of directors approved one year authorization programs allocating million for and million for to repurchase up to  shares or percent of our existing common stock over the following twelve months 
during the first three quarters of  we repurchased the entire  authorized shares for as a result  in december  the board of directors approved a program expiring february which authorized us to repurchase up to  additional shares at a cost not to exceed million 
during the fourth quarter  we fully executed the share repurchase program announced in december in october  the board of directors approved a program expiring at the end of july to repurchase an additional  shares 
we maintain an executive voluntary deferral plan and an outside directors deferral plan 
these plans allow executives and directors to defer eligible compensation into deferred stock units or a cash account bearing interest at a fixed rate of return 
we funded the purchase of  shares of common stock related to these plans in the shares are held in a trust to be used for payments to participants under the plans 
the trustee held  shares at december  further information on these plans can be found in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
centennial maintains an allowance for loan losses related to our loans receivable 
during  we did not experience a significant change in the underlying components of the allowance for loan losses or the balance in total 
there have been no significant changes in the underlying rationale for our provision for loan losses or significant changes in asset quality 
off balance sheet arrangements we administer escrow and trust deposits as a service to our customers 
these deposits totaled billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
our escrow and trust deposits are not considered assets and are not included in the accompanying balance sheets 
however  we remain contingently liable for the disposition of these deposits 
we have begun depositing a portion of these escrow and trust deposits in centennial 
of the billion in escrow  we have deposited million in centennial and those assets and liabilities have been reflected on the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
additionally  we facilitate tax deferred property exchanges for customers pursuant to section of the internal revenue code 
as a facilitator and intermediary  we hold the proceeds from sales transactions until a qualified acquisition occurs 
these deposits totaled  million and  million at december  and  respectively 
similarly  we also facilitate tax deferred reverse exchanges pursuant to revenue procedure these exchanges require us  using the customer s funds  to acquire qualifying property on behalf of the customer and take temporary title to the customer s property until a qualifying acquisition occurs 
reverse property exchanges totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
due to the structure utilized to facilitate these transactions  like kind exchanges and reverse exchanges are not considered assets of landamerica and are not included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
however  we remain contingently liable for the transfers of property  disbursement of proceeds and the return on the proceeds at the agreed upon rate 
in the ordinary course of business  we enter into business arrangements that fall within the scope of fin no 
 guarantors accounting and disclosure requirements including guarantees of indebtedness of others  and fin no 
 variable interest entities  both of which we adopted in there were no arrangements in these categories that are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our current or future operations  financial condition or results of operations

contractual obligations a summary of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments is as follows payment due by period in millions contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total obligations we included all purchase obligations in excess of  in value irrespective of their termination dates 
these include annually renewable corporate insurance programs  payments required under software licensing agreements  vehicle leasing arrangements  annual line of credit availability fees and fees to certain joint venture partners 
purchase obligations not exceeding  were not material to us  either individually or in the aggregate 
we have no required employer contributions to our cash balance pension plan at this time 
however  we anticipate contributing between million and million to the plan during our policy and contract claims loss reserve projected annual payments as of december  were as follows thereafter total dollars in millions policy and contract claims loss reserve percentage of total as of december   we had a policy and contract claims reserve of million 
the amounts and timing of these obligations are estimated and are not set contractually 
nonetheless  based on historical insurance claim experience  we anticipate the above payment patterns 
while we believe that historical loss payments are a reasonable source for projecting future claim payments  there is significant inherent uncertainty in this payment pattern estimate 
changes in claim reporting patterns  claim settlement patterns  judicial decisions  legislation  economic conditions and other factors could affect the timing and amount of actual claims payments 
interest rate risk the following table provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
for investment securities and loans receivable  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
actual cash flows could differ from the expected amounts

we also have long term debt of million bearing interest at an average rate of percent at december  our debt portfolio is primarily fixed rate obligations and not subject to variability 
additionally  we have interest bearing passbook and certificate of deposit liabilities of million bearing interest at an average rate of percent at december  which are subject to change based on short term united states interest rates and availability of funds 
a percent change in the interest rate for deposits would affect income before income taxes by approximately million annually 
the remaining million of deposit liabilities related to escrow balances are non interest bearing
