item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates the accompanying management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventory reserves  impairments of investments in marketable securities and investments accounted for by the equity method  the recoverability of other long lived assets including goodwill and other intangible assets  pension and other post retirement benefit obligations and the underlying actuarial assumptions related thereto  the realization of deferred income tax assets and accruals for litigation  income tax and other contingencies 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
actual results may differ from previously estimated amounts under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements o the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments and other factors 
the company takes into consideration the current financial condition of its customers  the age of the outstanding balance and the current economic environment when assessing the adequacy of the allowance 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
during  and the net amount written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of the balance of the allowance for doubtful accounts as of the beginning of the year ranged from to 
o the company provides reserves for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventories equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated net realizable value using assumptions about future demand for its products and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory reserves may be required 
the company also provides reserves for tools and supplies inventory based generally on both historical and expected future usage requirements 
o the company recognizes an impairment charge associated with its long lived assets  including property and equipment  whenever it determines that recovery of such long lived asset is not probable 
such determination is made in accordance with the applicable gaap requirements associated with the long lived asset  and is based upon  among other things  estimates of the amount of future net cash flows to be generated by the long lived asset and estimates of the current fair value of the asset 
adverse changes in such estimates of future net cash flows or estimates of fair value could result in an inability to recover the carrying value of the long lived asset  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge to be recognized in the future 
under applicable gaap sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  property and equipment is not assessed for impairment unless certain impairment indicators  as defined  are present 
during  no such impairment indicators  as defined  were present 
o the company maintains various defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefits other than pensions opeb 
the amounts recognized as defined benefit pension and opeb expenses  and the reported amounts of prepaid and accrued pension costs and accrued opeb costs  are actuarially determined based on several assumptions  including discount rates  expected rates of returns on plan assets and expected health care trend rates 
variances from these actuarially assumed rates will result in increases or decreases  as applicable  in the recognized pension and opeb obligations  pension and opeb expenses and funding requirements 
these assumptions are more fully described below under assumptions on defined benefit pension plans and opeb plans 
o the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred income tax assets to the amount that is believed to be realized under the more likely than not recognition criteria 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  it is possible that in the future the company may change its estimate of the amount of the deferred income tax assets that would more likely than not be realized in the future  resulting in an adjustment to the deferred income tax asset valuation allowance that would either increase or decrease  as applicable  reported net income in the period such change in estimate was made 
for example  the company has substantial net operating loss carryforwards in germany the equivalent of million for german corporate purposes and million for german trade tax purposes at december  
during  the company concluded that the more likely than not recognition criteria had been met with respect to the income tax benefit associated with the company s net operating loss carryforwards in germany 
prior to the complete utilization of such carryforwards  it is possible that the company might conclude in the future that the benefit of such carryforwards would no longer meet the more likely than not recognition criteria  at which point the company would be required to recognize a valuation allowance against the then remaining tax benefit associated with the carryforwards 
in addition  the company makes an evaluation at the end of each reporting period as to whether or not some or all of the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries are permanently reinvested as that term is defined in gaap 
while the company may have concluded in the past that some of such undistributed earnings are permanently reinvested  facts and circumstances can change in the future  and it is possible that a change in facts and circumstances  such as a change in the expectation regarding the capital needs of its foreign subsidiaries  could result in a conclusion that some or all of such undistributed earnings are no longer permanently reinvested 
in such an event  the company would be required to recognize a deferred income tax liability in an amount equal to the estimated incremental us income tax and withholding tax liability that would be generated if all of such previously considered permanently reinvested undistributed earnings were distributed to the us o the company records accruals for legal  income tax and other contingencies and commitments when estimated future expenditures associated with such contingencies become probable  and the amounts can be reasonably estimated 
however  new information may become available  or circumstances such as applicable laws and regulations may change  thereby resulting in an increase or decrease in the amount required to be accrued for such matters and therefore a decrease or increase in reported net income in the period of such change 
income from operations are impacted by certain of these significant judgments and estimates  such as allowance for doubtful accounts  reserves for obsolete or unmarketable inventories  impairment of equity method investees  and other long lived assets  defined benefit pension and opeb plans and loss accruals 
in addition  other income and expense items are impacted by the significant judgments and estimates for deferred income tax asset valuation allowances and loss accruals 
executive summary the company reported net income of million  or per diluted share  in compared to million  or per diluted share  in and million  or per diluted share  in the company s diluted earnings per share increased from to as the unfavorable effect of lower income from operations and higher interest expense in was more than offset by the favorable effect of a non cash income tax benefit in the company s diluted earnings per share decreased from to as the favorable effect of higher income from operations and lower interest expense in was more than offset by the favorable effect of the non cash income tax benefit recognized in net income in includes i a third quarter non cash income tax charge of

net income in includes an income tax benefit relating to the refund of prior year german income taxes of 
per diluted share 
each of these items is more fully discussed below and or in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the company currently expects income from operations will be lower in compared to  as the favorable effect of anticipated modest improvements in sales volumes and average tio selling prices are expected to be more than offset by the effect of higher production costs  particularly raw material and energy costs 
relative changes in the company s tio sales and operating income during the past three years are primarily due to i relative changes in tio sales and production volumes  ii relative changes in tio average selling prices and iii relative changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
selling prices in billing currencies for tio  the company s principal product  were generally increasing during the first quarter of  flat during the second quarter of  decreasing during the third and fourth quarters of and the first quarter of  flat during the second quarter of  increasing during the last half of and first half of and decreasing during the last half of results of operations years ended december  change in millions  except selling price data net sales    cost of sales gross margin selling  general and administrative expense currency transaction gains losses  net contract dispute settlement corporate expense other operating income expense  net

excluding the effect of fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies  kronos average tio selling prices in billing currencies were higher in as compared to when translated from billing currencies into us dollars using actual foreign currency exchange rates prevailing during the respective periods  kronos average tio selling prices in increased as compared to see effects of foreign currency exchange rates below for a discussion of the impact of relative changes in currency exchange rates on kronos operations 
kronos tio sales volumes in decreased compared to  with volumes lower in all regions of the world 
approximately one half of kronos tio sales volumes were attributable to markets in europe  with attributable to north america and the balance to export markets 
overall worldwide demand for tio in is estimated to have declined by approximately from the exceptionally strong demand levels in the company attributes the decline in overall sales and its own sales to slower overall economic growth in and inventory destocking by its customers 
kronos income from operations comparisons were favorably impacted by higher production levels  which increased 
kronos operating rates were near full capacity in both periods  and kronos production volumes in set a new record for kronos  which was the fourth consecutive year record production volumes were achieved 
the company s cost of sales increased million less than in compared to as the effect of lower sales volumes was offset by higher raw material and maintenance costs 
however  the company s cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  decreased from in to in due primarily to the effects of higher average selling prices which more than offset higher costs 
the company s gross margins increased million from to due to the net effects of the aforementioned changes in sales and cost of sales during such periods 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were relatively consistent at for both and kronos income from operations increased million in as compared to  as the effect of higher average tio selling prices and higher production volumes more than offset the impact of lower sales volumes  higher raw material and maintenance costs in and the million of income related to a contract dispute settlement with a customer recognized in  as further discussed below 
see also effects of foreign currency exchange rates below for a discussion of the impact of relative changes in currency exchange rates on kronos operations 
on september   the chloride process tio facility operated by kronos owned joint venture  louisiana pigment company lpc  temporarily halted production due to hurricane rita 
although storm damage to core processing facilities was not extensive  a variety of factors  including loss of utilities  limited access and availability of employees and raw materials  prevented the resumption of partial operations until october  and full operations until late the joint venture expects the majority of its property damage and unabsorbed fixed costs for periods in which normal production levels were not achieved will be covered by insurance  and kronos believes insurance will cover its lost profits subject to applicable deductibles resulting from its share of the lost production from lpc 
insurance proceeds from the lost profit for product that kronos was not able to sell as a result of the loss of production from lpc  are expected to be recognized by kronos during  although the amount and timing of such insurance recoveries is not presently determinable 
the effect on kronos financial results will depend on the timing and amount of insurance recoveries 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  kronos sales increased million in as compared to as higher sales volumes and the favorable effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  which increased sales by approximately million as further discussed below  more than offset the impact of lower average tio selling prices 
excluding the effect of fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies  kronos average tio selling prices in billing currencies were lower in as compared to when translated from billing currencies into us dollars using actual foreign currency exchange rates prevailing during the respective periods  kronos average tio selling prices in increased as compared to see effects of foreign currency exchange rates below for a discussion of the impact of relative changes in currency exchange rates on kronos operations 
kronos tio sales volumes in increased compared to  as higher volumes in european and export markets more than offset lower volumes in canada 
approximately one half of kronos tio sales volumes were attributable to markets in europe  with attributable to north america and the balance to export markets 
demand for tio has remained strong throughout  and while kronos believes that the strong demand is largely attributable to the end use demand of its customers  it is possible that some portion of the strong demand resulted from customers increasing their inventory levels of tio in advance of implementation of announced or anticipated price increases 
kronos income from operations comparisons were also favorably impacted by higher production levels  which increased 
kronos operating rates were near full capacity in both periods  and kronos sales and production volumes in were both new records for kronos 
the company s cost of sales increased million in compared to due to higher raw material and maintenance costs as well as higher sales volumes and related effects of translating foreign currencies into the us dollar 
the company s cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  increased from in to in due primarily to the effects of lower average selling prices and higher costs 
the company s gross margins decreased million from to due to the net effects of the aforementioned changes in sales and cost of sales during such periods 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were relatively consistent from to  increasing marginally from to  and increasing proportionately with the increased sales and production volume 
kronos income from operations in includes million of income related to the settlement of a contract dispute with a customer 
as part of the settlement  the customer agreed to make payments to kronos through aggregating million 
the million gain recognized represents the present value of the future payments to be made by the customer to kronos 
the dispute with the customer concerned the customer s alleged past failure to purchase the required amount of tio from kronos under the terms of kronos contract with the customer 
under the settlement  the customer agreed to pay an aggregate of million to kronos through to resolve such dispute 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
kronos income from operations decreased million in as compared to  as the effect of lower average tio selling prices and higher raw material and maintenance costs more than offset the impact of higher sales and production volumes and the income from the contract dispute settlement 
see also effects of foreign currency exchange rates below for a discussion of the impact of relative changes in currency exchange rates on kronos operations 
effects of foreign currency exchange rates kronos sales are denominated in various currencies  including the us dollar  the euro  other major european currencies and the canadian dollar 
the disclosure of the percentage change in kronos average tio selling prices in billing currencies which excludes the effects of fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies is considered a non gaap financial measure under regulations of the sec 
the disclosure of the percentage change in kronos average tio selling prices using actual foreign currency exchange rates prevailing during the respective periods is considered the most directly comparable financial measure presented in accordance with gaap gaap measure 
kronos discloses percentage changes in its average tio prices in billing currencies because kronos believes such disclosure provides useful information to investors to allow them to analyze such changes without the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  thereby facilitating period to period comparisons of the relative changes in average selling prices in the actual various billing currencies 
generally  when the us dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies  the percentage change in average selling prices in billing currencies will be higher or lower  respectively  than such percentage changes would be using actual exchange rates prevailing during the respective periods 
the difference between the and increases in kronos average tio selling prices during and  respectively  as compared to the respective prior year using actual foreign currency exchange rates prevailing during the respective periods the gaap measure  and the decrease and increase in kronos average tio selling prices in billing currencies the non gaap measure during such periods is due to the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the above table presents i the percentage change in kronos average tio selling prices using actual foreign currency exchange rates prevailing during the respective periods the gaap measure  ii the percentage change in kronos average tio selling prices in billing currencies the non gaap measure and iii the percentage change due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates or the reconciling item between the non gaap measure and the gaap measure 
kronos has substantial operations and assets located outside the united states primarily in germany  belgium  norway and canada 
a significant amount of kronos sales generated from its non us operations are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  principally the euro  other major european currencies and the canadian dollar 
a portion of kronos sales generated from its non us operations are denominated in the non us dollar 
certain raw materials  primarily titanium containing feedstocks  are purchased in us dollars  while labor and other production costs are denominated primarily in local currencies 
consequently  the translated us dollar value of kronos foreign sales and operating results are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations which may favorably or adversely impact reported earnings and may affect the comparability of period to period operating results 
overall  fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies  primarily the euro  increased tio sales by a net million in as compared to  and increased sales by a net million in as compared to fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies similarly impacted kronos foreign currency denominated operating expenses 
kronos operating costs that are not denominated in the us dollar  when translated into us dollars  were higher in  and compared to the same periods of the respective prior years 
overall  currency exchange rate fluctuations resulted in net increases of million in kronos income from operations in each of and as compared to the respective prior year 
outlook kronos expects its income from operations in will be somewhat lower than  as the favorable effect of anticipated modest improvements in sales volumes and average tio selling prices are expected to be more than offset by the effect of higher production costs  particularly raw material and energy costs 
kronos expectations as to the future prospects of kronos and the tio industry are based upon a number of factors beyond kronos control  including worldwide growth of gross domestic product  competition in the marketplace  unexpected or earlier than expected capacity additions and technological advances 
if actual developments differ from kronos expectations  kronos results of operations could be unfavorably affected 
kronos efforts to debottleneck its production facilities to meet long term demand continue to prove successful 
such debottlenecking efforts included  among other things  the addition of finishing capacity in the german facility and equipment upgrades and enhancements in several locations to allow for reduced downtime for maintenance activities 
kronos production capacity has increased by approximately over the past ten years due to debottlenecking programs  with only moderate capital expenditures 
kronos believes its annual attainable production capacity for is approximately  metric tons  with some slight additional capacity expected to be available in through its continued debottlenecking efforts 
other income expense 
the following table sets forth certain information regarding other income and expense items 
years ended december  change in millions interest income from affiliates 

trade interest income 


other interest income 



securities transaction gain interest expense to affiliates other interest expense interest income fluctuates in part based upon the amount of funds invested and yields thereon 
aggregate interest income decreased slightly in compared to due to lower average funds available for investment 
as compared to  aggregate interest income in increased  due to higher average yields on invested funds 
the company expects interest income will be slightly higher in than due to higher average yields expected on invested funds 
securities transaction gain in relates to the sale of the company s passive interest in a norwegian smelting operation  which had a nominal carrying value for financial reporting purposes  for aggregate consideration of approximately million consisting of cash of million and inventory with a value of million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company has a significant amount of indebtedness denominated in the euro  including kii s euro denominated senior secured notes senior secured notes 
accordingly  the reported amount of interest expense will vary depending on relative changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
interest expense on indebtedness to third parties in was higher than due primarily to higher levels of outstanding indebtedness resulting from the issuance of an additional euro million principal amount of kii senior secured notes in november in addition  the increase in interest expense was due to relative changes in foreign currency exchange rates  which increased the us dollar equivalent of interest expense on the euro million principal amount of kii senior secured notes outstanding during all of  and by approximately million and by approximately million in as compared to the company did not report any interest expense to affiliates in as the million long term note payable to affiliates was fully repaid in see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company does not currently expect to report any material interest expense to affiliates in assuming interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates do not increase significantly from current levels  interest expense on third party indebtedness in is expected to be comparable to at december   approximately million of consolidated indebtedness  principally kii s senior secured notes  bears interest at fixed interest rates averaging million with a weighted average interest rate of  million with a weighted average fixed interest rate of 
the weighted average interest rate on million of outstanding variable rate borrowings at december  was million outstanding at  none outstanding 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
as noted above  kii has a significant amount of indebtedness denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
provision for income taxes 
the principal reasons for the difference between the company s effective income tax rates and the us federal statutory income tax rates are explained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company s income tax expense in includes the net non cash effects of i the aggregate favorable effects of recent developments with respect to certain non us income tax audits of kronos  principally in belgium and canada  of million 
per diluted share and ii the unfavorable effect with respect to the loss of certain income tax attributes of kronos in germany of million 
per diluted share 
at december   kronos had the equivalent of million and million of income tax loss carryforwards for german corporate and trade tax purposes  respectively  all of which have no expiration date 
as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements  kronos had previously provided a deferred income tax asset valuation allowance against substantially all of these tax loss carryforwards and other deductible temporary differences in germany because kronos did not believe they met the more likely than not recognition criteria 
during the first six months of  kronos reduced its deferred income tax asset valuation allowance by approximately million  primarily as a result of utilization of these german net operating loss carryforwards  the benefit of which had not previously been recognized 
at june   after considering all available evidence  kronos concluded that these german tax loss carryforwards and other deductible temporary differences now met the more likely than not recognition criteria 
under applicable gaap related to accounting for income taxes at interim periods  a change in estimate at an interim period resulting in a decrease in the valuation allowance is segregated into two components  the portion related to the remaining interim periods of the current year and the portion related to all future years 
the portion of the valuation allowance reversal related to the former is recognized over the remaining interim periods of the current year  and the portion of the valuation allowance related to the latter is recognized at the time the change in estimate is made 
accordingly  as of june   kronos reversed million of the valuation allowance the portion related to future years  and kronos reversed the remaining million during the last six months of prior to the complete utilization of such carryforwards  it is possible that the company might conclude in the future that the benefit of such carryforwards would no longer meet the more likely than not recognition criteria  at which point the company would be required to recognize a valuation allowance against the then remaining tax benefit associated with the carryforwards 
in january  the german federal government enacted new tax law amendments that limit the annual utilization of income tax loss carryforwards effective january  to of taxable income after the first euro million of taxable income 
the new law will have a significant effect on kronos cash tax payments in germany going forward  the extent of which will be dependent upon the level of taxable income earned in germany 
during  kronos reduced its deferred income tax asset valuation allowance by an aggregate of approximately million  primarily as a result of utilization of certain income tax attributes for which the benefit had not previously been recognized 
in addition  kronos recognized a million income tax benefit related to the net refund of certain prior year german income taxes 
in october  the american jobs creation act of was enacted into law 
the new law provided for a special deduction for certain dividends received from a controlled foreign corporation in in the third quarter of  the company completed its evaluation of this new provision and determined that it would not benefit from such special dividends received deduction

accounting principles newly adopted in and see note to the consolidated financial statements 
accounting principles not yet adopted 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
defined benefit pension plans 
the company maintains various defined benefit pension plans in the us  europe and canada 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company accounts for its defined benefit pension plans using sfas no 
 employer s accounting for pensions 
under sfas no 
 defined benefit pension plan expense and prepaid and accrued pension costs are each recognized based on certain actuarial assumptions  principally the assumed discount rate  the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed increase in future compensation levels 
the company recognized consolidated defined benefit pension plan expense of million in  million in and million in the amount of funding requirements for these defined benefit pension plans is generally based upon applicable regulations such as erisa in the us  and will generally differ from pension expense recognized under sfas no 
for financial reporting purposes 
contributions made by the company to all of its plans aggregated million in  million in and million in the discount rates the company utilizes for determining defined benefit pension expense and the related pension obligations are based on current interest rates earned on long term bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by recognized rating agencies in the applicable country where the defined benefit pension benefits are being paid 
in addition  the company receives advice about appropriate discount rates from the company s third party actuaries  who may in some cases utilize their own market indices 
the discount rates are adjusted as of each valuation date september th to reflect then current interest rates on such long term bonds 
such discount rates are used to determine the actuarial present value of the pension obligations as of december st of that year  and such discount rates are also used to determine the interest component of defined benefit pension expense for the following year 
at december   approximately   and of the projected benefit obligation related to company plans in germany  norway  canada and the us  respectively 
the company uses several different discount rate assumptions in determining its consolidated defined benefit pension plan obligations and expense because the company maintains defined benefit pension plans in several different countries in north america and europe and the interest rate environment differs from country to country 
the company used the following discount rates for its defined benefit pension plans discount rates used for obligations at obligations at obligations at december  and expense december  and expense december  and in in expense in germany norway canada us the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets represents the estimated average rate of earnings expected to be earned on the funds invested or to be invested in the plans assets provided to fund the benefit payments inherent in the projected benefit obligations 
unlike the discount rate  which is adjusted each year based on changes in current long term interest rates  the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets will not necessarily change based upon the actual  short term performance of the plan assets in any given year 
defined benefit pension expense each year is based upon the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets for each plan and the actual fair value of the plan assets as of the beginning of the year 
differences between the expected return on plan assets for a given year and the actual return are deferred and amortized over future periods based either upon the expected average remaining service life of the active plan participants for plans for which benefits are still being earned by active employees or the average remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants for plans for which benefits are not still being earned by active employees 
at december   approximately   and of the plan assets related to the company s plans in the germany  norway  canada and the us  respectively 
the company uses several different long term rates of return on plan asset assumptions in determining its consolidated defined benefit pension plan expense because the company maintains defined benefit pension plans in several different countries in north america and europe  the plan assets in different countries are invested in a different mix of investments and the long term rates of return for different investments differ from country to country 
in determining the expected long term rate of return on plan asset assumptions  the company considers the long term asset mix eg equity vs 
fixed income for the assets for each of its plans and the expected long term rates of return for such asset components 
in addition  the company receives advice about appropriate long term rates of return from the company s third party actuaries 
such assumed asset mixes are summarized below o in germany  the composition of the company s plan assets is established to satisfy the requirements of the german insurance commissioner 
the plan asset allocation at december  was to equity managers  to fixed income managers and to real estate  and  respectively 
o in norway  the company currently has a plan asset target allocation of to equity managers and to fixed income managers and the remainder primarily to cash and liquid investments 
the expected long term rate of return for such investments is approximately and to and  respectively 
the plan asset allocation at december  was to equity managers and to fixed income managers and the remainder primarily to cash and liquid investments  and  respectively 
o in canada  the company currently has a plan asset target allocation of to equity managers and to fixed income managers  with an expected long term rate of return for such investments to average approximately basis points above the applicable equity or fixed income index 
the current plan asset allocation at december  was to equity managers  to fixed income managers and to other investments  and nil  respectively 
o during  the plan assets in the us were invested in the combined master retirement trust cmrt  a collective investment trust sponsored by contran to permit the collective investment by certain master trusts which fund certain employee benefits plans sponsored by contran and certain of its affiliates 
harold simmons is the sole trustee of the cmrt 
the cmrt s long term investment objective is to provide a rate of return exceeding a composite of broad market equity and fixed income indices including the s p and certain russell indices utilizing both third party investment managers as well as investments directed by mr 
simmons 
during the year history of the cmrt through december   the average annual rate of return has been approximately with a return for 
at december  the asset mix of the cmrt was in us equity securities  in us fixed income securities  in international equity securities and in cash and other investments 
at december   the asset mix of the cmrt was in us equity securities  in us fixed income securities  in international equity securities and in cash and other investments 
the company regularly reviews its actual asset allocation for each of its plans  and will periodically rebalance the investments in each plan to more accurately reflect the targeted allocation when considered appropriate 
the company s assumed long term rates of return on plan assets for  and were as follows germany norway canada us the company currently expects to utilize the same long term rate of return on plan asset assumptions in as it used in for purposes of determining the defined benefit pension plan expense 
to the extent that a plan s particular pension benefit formula calculates the pension benefit in whole or in part based upon future compensation levels  the projected benefit obligations and the pension expense will be based in part upon expected increases in future compensation levels 
for all of the company s plans for which the benefit formula is so calculated  the company generally bases the assumed expected increase in future compensation levels upon average long term inflation rates for the applicable country 
in addition to the actuarial assumptions discussed above  because the company maintains defined benefit pension plans outside the us  the amount of recognized defined benefit pension expense and the amount of prepaid and accrued pension costs will vary based upon relative changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
as discussed above  assumed discount rates and rate of return on plan assets are re evaluated annually 
a reduction in the assumed discount rate generally results in an actuarial loss  as the actuarially determined present value of estimated future benefit payments will increase 
conversely  an increase in the assumed discount rate generally results in an actuarial gain 
in addition  an actual return on plan assets for a given year that is greater than the assumed return on plan assets results in an actuarial gain  while an actual return on plan assets that is less than the assumed return results in an actuarial loss 
other actual outcomes that differ from previous assumptions  such as individuals living longer or shorter than assumed in mortality tables which are also used to determine the actuarially determined present value of estimated future benefit payments  changes in such mortality table themselves or plan amendments  will also result in actuarial losses or gains 
under gaap  all of such actuarial gains and losses are not recognized in earnings currently  but instead are deferred and amortized into income in the future as part of net periodic defined benefit pension cost 
however  any actuarial gains generated in future periods would reduce the negative amortization effect of any cumulative unrecognized actuarial losses  while any actuarial losses generated in future periods would reduce the favorable amortization effect of any cumulative unrecognized actuarial gains 
during  all of the company s defined benefit pension plans generated a net actuarial loss of million 
this actuarial loss resulted primarily from the general overall reduction in the assumed discount rates as well as the unfavorable effect of using updated mortality tables which generally reflect individuals living longer than prior mortality tables used  partially offset by an actual return on plan assets in excess of the assumed return 
while actuarial gains and losses are deferred and amortized into income in future periods  as discussed above  gaap also requires that a minimum amount of accrued pension cost be recognized in a statement of financial position for any plans for which the accumulated benefit obligation is less than the fair value of plan assets 
to the extent gaap accounting would otherwise result in an accrued pension cost balance for such plans that was less than the excess of the aggregate accumulated benefit obligation over the value of the related plan assets  gaap then requires that such excess be recognized as a component of the consolidated accrued pension cost  with the offset to such additional accrued pension cost commonly referred to as an additional minimum liability recognized i first as an intangible asset up to specified amounts referred to as unrecognized net pension obligations in the company s balance sheet and then ii second as part of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
at december   and primarily as a result of the aggregate million actuarial loss generated during as discussed above  the amount of the additional minimum liability required to be recognized by the company increased by approximately million at december  as compared to december   resulting in the company recognized aggregate accrued pension cost current and noncurrent of million at december  as compared to million at december  based on the actuarial assumptions described above and the company s current expectation for what actual average foreign currency exchange rates will be during  the company expects its defined benefit pension expense will approximate million in in comparison  the company expects to be required to make approximately million of contributions to such plans during as noted above  defined benefit pension expense and the amounts recognized as accrued pension costs are based upon the actuarial assumptions discussed above 
the company believes all of the actuarial assumptions used are reasonable and appropriate 
if the company had lowered the assumed discount rate by basis points for all of its plans as of december   the company s aggregate projected benefit obligations would have increased by approximately million at that date  and the company s defined benefit pension expense would be expected to increase by approximately million during similarly  if the company lowered the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets by basis points for all of its plans  the company s defined benefit pension expense would be expected to increase by approximately  during opeb plans 
certain subsidiaries of the company in the us and canada currently provide certain health care and life insurance benefits for eligible retired employees 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company accounts for such opeb costs under sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
under sfas no 
 opeb expense and accrued opeb costs are based on certain actuarial assumptions  principally the assumed discount rate and the assumed rate of increases in future health care costs 
the company recognized consolidated opeb income of approximately  in and consolidated opeb cost of approximately  in and  in similar to defined benefit pension benefits  the amount of funding will differ from the expense recognized for financial reporting purposes  and contributions to the plans to cover benefit payments aggregated million in each of and and approximately million in substantially all of the company s accrued opeb cost relates to benefits being paid to current retirees and their dependents  and no material amount of opeb benefits are being earned by current employees 
as a result  the amount recognized for opeb expense for financial reporting purposes has been  and is expected to continue to be  significantly less than the amount of opeb benefit payments made each year 
accordingly  the amount of accrued opeb expense has been  and is expected to continue to  decline gradually 
the assumed discount rates the company utilizes for determining opeb expense and the related accrued opeb obligations are generally based on the same discount rates the company utilizes for its us and canadian defined benefit pension plans 
in estimating the health care cost trend rate  the company considers its actual health care cost experience  future benefit structures  industry trends and advice from its third party actuaries 
during each of the past three years  the company has assumed that the relative increase in health care costs will generally trend downward over the next several years  reflecting  among other things  assumed increases in efficiency in the health care system and industry wide cost containment initiatives 
for example  at december   the expected rate of increase in future health care costs ranges from in  declining to to in and thereafter 
based on the actuarial assumptions described above and the company s current expectation for what actual average foreign currency exchange rates will be during  the company expects its consolidated opeb expense will approximate  in in comparison  the company expects to be required to make approximately  of contributions to such plans during as noted above  opeb expense and the amount recognized as accrued opeb costs are based upon the actuarial assumptions discussed above 
the company believes all of the actuarial assumptions used are reasonable and appropriate 
if the company had lowered the assumed discount rate by basis points for all of its opeb plans as of december   the company s aggregate projected benefit obligations would have increased by approximately  at that date  and the company s opeb expense would be expected to increase by less than  during similarly  if the assumed future health care cost trend rate had been increased by basis points  the company s accumulated opeb obligations would have increased by approximately million at december   and opeb expense would have increased by  in liquidity and capital resources summary the company s primary source of liquidity on an ongoing basis is its cash flows from operating activities  which is generally used to i fund capital expenditures  ii repay short term indebtedness incurred primarily for working capital purposes and iii provide for the payment of dividends 
in addition  from time to time the company will incur indebtedness  generally to i fund short term working capital needs  ii refinance existing indebtedness or iii fund major capital expenditures or the acquisition of other assets outside the ordinary course of business 
also  the company may from time to time sell assets outside the ordinary course of business  the proceeds of which are generally used to i repay existing indebtedness including indebtedness which may have been collateralized by the assets sold  ii fund major capital expenditures or the acquisition of other assets outside the ordinary course of business or iii pay dividends 
at december   the company s indebtedness was substantially comprised of million related to kii s senior secured notes due in and million related to kronos us million revolving credit facility us credit facility due in september accordingly  the company does not currently expect that a significant amount of its cash flows from operating activities generated during will be required to be used to repay indebtedness during consolidated cash flows the company s consolidated cash flows for each of the past three years are presented below years ended december  in millions operating activities investing activities financing activities net cash provided by operating  investing and financing activities operating cash flows 
trends in cash flows from operating activities excluding the impact of significant asset dispositions and relative changes in assets and liabilities are generally similar to trends in the company s earnings 
however  certain items included in the determination of net income are non cash  and therefore such items have no impact on cash flows from operating activities 
non cash items included in the determination of net income include depreciation and amortization expense  non cash interest expense and deferred income taxes 
non cash interest expense relates to amortization of original issue discount or premium on certain indebtedness and amortization of deferred financing costs 
certain other items included in the determination of net income may have an impact on cash flows from operating activities  but the impact of such items on cash flows from operating activities will differ from their impact on net income 
for example  the amount of periodic defined benefit pension plan expense and periodic opeb expense depends upon a number of factors  including certain actuarial assumptions  and changes in such actuarial assumptions will result in a change in the reported expense 
in addition  the amount of such periodic expense generally differs from the outflows of cash required to be currently paid for such benefits 
certain other items included in the determination of net income have no impact on cash flows from operating activities  but such items do impact cash flows from investing activities although their impact on such cash flows differs from their impact on net income 
for example  realized gains and losses from the disposal of long lived assets are included in the determination of net income  although the proceeds from any such disposal are shown as part of cash flows from investing activities 
changes in product pricing  production volumes and customer demand  among other things  can significantly affect the liquidity of the company 
relative changes in assets and liabilities generally result from the timing of production  sales  purchases and income tax payments 
such relative changes can significantly impact the comparability of cash flow from operations from period to period  as the income statement impact of such items may occur in a different period from when the underlying cash transaction occurs 
for example  raw materials may be purchased in one period  but the payment for such raw materials may occur in a subsequent period 
similarly  inventory may be sold in one period  but the cash collection of the receivable may occur in a subsequent period 
relative changes in accounts receivable are affected by  among other things  the timing of sales and the collection of the resulting receivable 
relative changes in inventories  accounts payable and accrued liabilities are affected by  among other things  the timing of raw material purchases and the payment for such purchases and the relative difference between production volumes and sales volumes 
cash flows provided from operating activities decreased from million in to million in this million decrease was due primarily to the net effect of i lower net income of million  ii higher deferred income taxes of million  iii lower depreciation and amortization expense of approximately  iv lower net distributions from kronos tio manufacturing joint venture of million  v a higher amount of net cash used to fund changes in the company s inventories  receivables  payables  accruals and accounts with affiliates of million and vi higher cash paid for income taxes of million  due primarily to aggregate income tax refunds of million received in cash flows from operating activities increased from million in to million in this million increase was due primarily to the effect of i higher net income of million  ii a larger deferred income tax benefit of million  iii higher depreciation and amortization expense of million  iv higher net distributions from the tio manufacturing joint venture of million  v a higher amount of net cash generated from relative changes in the company s inventories  receivables  payables and accruals and accounts with affiliates of million in as compared to and vi higher cash received for income taxes of million 
the company s average days sales outstanding dso decreased from days at december  to days at december   due to the timing of collections 
at december   the average number of days in inventory dii increased to days from days at december  due to the effects of higher production volume and lower sales volume 
investing cash flows 
the company s capital expenditures were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in addition  the company purchased additional shares of its majority owned french subsidiary for  in  and the company received million in from the sale of its passive interest in a norwegian smelting operations 
the company s capital expenditures during the past three years include an aggregate of approximately million million in for the company s ongoing environmental protection and compliance programs 
the company s estimated capital expenditures are million and include approximately million in the area of environmental protection and compliance 
financing cash flows 
during  the company i repaid euro million million when repaid under its european credit facility  ii borrowed million and repaid million under its us credit facility and iii entered into additional capital lease agreements for certain mining equipment for the equivalent of approximately million 
during  i kii issued an additional euro million principal amount of it senior secured notes at of par equivalent to million when issued and ii kii s operating subsidiaries in germany and belgium borrowed an aggregate of euro million million when borrowed of borrowings under its european credit facility  of which euro million million when repaid were subsequently repaid 
on september   nl completed the acquisition of the shares of common stock of compx international inc previously held by valhi and valcor  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of valhi 
the purchase price for these shares was paid by nl s transfer to valhi and valcor of an aggregate million of nl s million long term note receivable from kronos 
in october  valcor distributed its note receivable from kronos to valhi  and subsequently kronos prepaid million on the note payable to valhi including accrued interest principally using available cash on hand 
in november  the remaining balances due under these notes were repaid primarily using the funds raised from the issuance of euro million principal amount of kii s senior secured notes  and the notes were cancelled 
in march  the company s operating subsidiaries in germany  belgium and norway borrowed euro million million when borrowed  in april  repaid nok million million when repaid and in the third quarter of  repaid euro million million when repaid under its european credit facility 
deferred financing costs of million paid in for the senior secured notes  the european credit facility and the company s us revolving credit facility are being amortized over the life of the respective agreements and are included in other noncurrent assets as of december  cash dividends paid during  and totaled million  million and million  respectively 
on february   the company s board of directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of 
per share to stockholders of record as of march  to be paid on march  the declaration and payment of future dividends is discretionary  and the amount  if any  will be dependent upon the company s results of operations  financial condition  contractual restrictions and other factors deemed relevant by the company s board of directors 
cash flows related to capital contributions and other transactions with affiliates aggregated a net cash inflow of million in such amounts related principally to loans that kronos made to affiliates such notes receivable from affiliates being reported as reductions to kronos stockholders equity  and therefore considered financing cash flows 
additionally  settlement of the above mentioned notes receivable from affiliates was not then currently contemplated in the foreseeable future 
provisions contained in certain of kronos credit agreements could result in the acceleration of the applicable indebtedness prior to its stated maturity 
for example  certain credit agreements allow the lender to accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness upon a change of control as defined of the borrower 
in addition  certain credit agreements could result in the acceleration of all or a portion of the indebtedness following a sale of assets outside the ordinary course of business 
kii s assets consist primarily of investments in its operating subsidiaries  and its ability to service its parent level obligations  including the senior secured notes  depends in large part upon the distribution of earnings of its subsidiaries  whether in the form of dividends  advances or payments on account of intercompany obligation  or otherwise 
none of its subsidiaries have guaranteed the senior secured notes  although kii has pledged of the common stock or other ownership interest of certain of its first tier operating subsidiaries as collateral of such senior secured notes

at december   the company had current cash and cash equivalents aggregating million million held by non us subsidiaries 
at december   the company s non us and non us subsidiaries had current restricted cash equivalents of million and noncurrent restricted marketable debt securities of million 
at december   certain of the company s subsidiaries had approximately million available for borrowing with approximately million available under non us credit facilities including approximately million under the european credit facility and million under its canadian credit facility and approximately million available under the us credit facility based on borrowing availability 
at december   kii had approximately million available for payment of dividends and other restricted payments as defined in the indenture for the senior secured notes 
based upon the company s expectations for the tio industry and anticipated demands on the company s cash resources as discussed herein  including debt refinancing expectations the company expects to have sufficient liquidity to meet its short term obligations defined as the twelve month period ending december  and its long term obligations defined as the five year period ending december   the time period for which the company generally does long term budgeting  including operations  capital expenditures  debt service and current dividend policy 
to the extent that actual developments differ from the company s expectations  the company s liquidity could be adversely affected 
legal proceedings and environmental matters 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for certain legal proceedings and environmental matters with respect to the company 
foreign operations 
as discussed above  the company has substantial operations located outside the united states for which the functional currency is not the us dollar 
as a result  the reported amount of the company s assets and liabilities related to its non us operations  and therefore the company s consolidated net assets  will fluctuate based upon changes in currency exchange rates 
at december   the company had substantial net assets denominated in the euro  canadian dollar  norwegian kroner and united kingdom pound sterling 
other 
the company periodically evaluates its liquidity requirements  alternative uses of capital  capital needs and availability of resources in view of  among other things  its dividend policy  its debt service and capital expenditure requirements and estimated future operating cash flows 
as a result of this process  the company in the past has sought  and in the future may seek  to reduce  refinance  repurchase or restructure indebtedness  raise additional capital  issue additional securities  repurchase shares of its common stock  modify its dividend policy  restructure ownership interests  sell interests in subsidiaries or other assets  or take a combination of such steps or other steps to manage its liquidity and capital resources 
in the normal course of its business  the company may review opportunities for the acquisition  divestiture  joint venture or other business combinations in the chemicals or other industries  as well as the acquisition of interests in related companies 
in the event of any such transaction  the company may consider using available cash  issuing equity securities or increasing its indebtedness to the extent permitted by the agreements governing the company s existing debt 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
non gaap financial measures 
in an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the company s results as determined by gaap  kronos has disclosed certain non gaap information which the company believes provides useful information to investors 
as discussed above  the company discloses percentage changes in its average tio prices in billing currencies  which excludes the effects of foreign currency translation 
such disclosure of the percentage change in kronos average tio selling price in billing currencies is considered a non gaap financial measure under regulations of the sec 
the disclosure of the percentage change in the company s average tio selling prices using actual foreign currency exchange rates prevailing during the respective periods is considered the most directly comparable gaap measure 
the company discloses percentage changes in its average tio prices in billing currencies because the company believes such disclosure provides useful information to investors to allow them to analyze such changes without the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  thereby facilitating period to period comparisons of the relative changes in average selling prices in the actual various billing currencies 
generally  when the us dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies  the percentage change in average selling prices in billing currencies will be higher or lower  respectively  than such percentage changes using actual exchange rates prevailing during the respective periods 
summary of debt and other contractual commitments as more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  the company is a party to various debt  lease and other agreements which contractually and unconditionally commit the company to pay certain amounts in the future 
see notes  and to the consolidated financial statements 
the company s obligation for the purchase of tio feedstock is more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements and above in business raw materials 
the following table summarizes such contractual commitments of the company and its consolidated subsidiaries as of december  by the type and date of payment 
payment due date and contractual commitment after total in millions third party indebtedness interest payments on third party indebtedness operating leases fixed asset acquisitions long term supply contracts for the purchase of tio feedstock estimated tax obligations primarily relates to kii s senior secured notes 
see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and note to the consolidated financial statements 
the timing and amount shown for the company s commitments related to indebtedness principal and interest  operating leases  fixed asset acquisitions  long term supply contracts and other are based upon the contractual payment amount and the contractual payment date for such commitments 
with respect to revolving credit facilities  the amount shown for indebtedness is based upon the actual amount outstanding at december   and the amount shown for interest for any outstanding variable rate indebtedness is based upon the december  interest rate and assumes that such variable rate indebtedness remains outstanding until the maturity of the facility 
the amount shown for income taxes is the consolidated amount of income taxes payable at december   which is assumed to be paid during a significant portion of the amount shown for indebtedness relates to kii s senior secured notes million at december  
such indebtedness is denominated in euro 
see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and note to the consolidated financial statements 
kronos contracts for the purchase of tio feedstock contain fixed quantities that kronos is required to purchase  although certain of these contracts allow for an upward or downward adjustment in the quantity purchased  generally no more than  based on the company s feedstock requirements 
the pricing under these agreements is generally based on a fixed price with price escalation clauses primarily based on consumer price indices  as defined in the respective contracts 
the timing and amount shown for the company s commitments related to the long term supply contracts for tio feedstock is based upon the company s current estimate of the quantity of material that will be purchased in each time period shown  and the payment that would be due based upon such estimated purchased quantity and an estimate of the effect of the price escalation clause 
the actual amount of material purchased  and the actual amount that would be payable by the company  may vary from such estimated amounts 
the above table does not reflect any amounts that the company might pay to fund its defined benefit pension plans and opeb plans  as the timing and amount of any such future fundings are unknown and dependent on  among other things  the future performance of defined benefit pension plan assets  interest rate assumptions and actual future retiree medical costs 
such defined benefit pension plans and opeb plans are discussed above in greater detail 
the table also does not reflect any amounts that the company might pay related to its asset retirement obligations as the terms and amounts of such future fundings are unknown 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
the above table also does not reflect any amounts the company might pay to acquire tio from its tio manufacturing joint venture  as the timing and amount of such purchases are unknown and dependent on  among other things  the amount of tio produced by the joint venture in the future and the joint venture s future cost of producing such tio however  the table does include amounts related to kronos share of the joint venture s ore requirements necessary to produce tio for kronos 
see item  business and note to the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general 
the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and equity security prices 
in the past  the company has periodically entered into currency forward contracts  interest rate swaps or other types of contracts in order to manage a portion of its interest rate market risk 
otherwise  the company does not generally enter into forward or option contracts to manage such market risks  nor does the company enter into any such contract or other type of derivative instrument for trading or speculative purposes 
other than as described below  the company was not a party to any material forward or derivative option contract related to foreign exchange rates  interest rates or equity security prices at december  and see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
interest rates 
the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  primarily related to indebtedness 
at december  and  substantially all of the company s aggregate indebtedness was comprised of fixed rate instruments 
the large percentage of fixed rate debt instruments minimizes earnings volatility that would result from changes in interest rates 
the following table presents principal amounts and weighted average interest rates for the company s aggregate outstanding indebtedness at december  at december  and  all outstanding fixed rate indebtedness was denominated in us dollars or the euro and the outstanding variable rate borrowings were denominated in euros 
information shown below for such foreign currency denominated indebtedness is presented in its us dollar equivalent at december  using an exchange rate of us dollars per euro 
certain norwegian kroner denominated capital leases totaling million in have been excluded from the table below 
amount carrying fair interest maturity indebtedness value value rate date in millions fixed rate indebtedness euro denominated kii senior secured notes variable rate indebtedness dollar denominated us credit facility at december   fixed rate indebtedness aggregated million fair value million with a weighted average interest rate of 
all of such fixed rate indebtedness was denominated in euros 
variable indebtedness at december  was million with a weighted average interest rate of foreign currency exchange rates 
the company is exposed to market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of manufacturing and selling its products worldwide 
earnings are primarily affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to the euro  the canadian dollar  the norwegian kroner and the united kingdom pound sterling 
as described above  at december   the company had the equivalent of million of outstanding euro denominated indebtedness the equivalent of million of euro denominated indebtedness 
the potential increase in the us dollar equivalent of the principal amount outstanding resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in exchange rates at such date would be approximately million at december  million 
certain of the company s sales generated by its non us operations are denominated in us dollars 
the company periodically uses currency forward contracts to manage a very nominal portion of foreign exchange rate risk associated with receivables denominated in a currency other than the holder s functional currency or similar exchange rate risk associated with future sales 
the company has not entered into these contracts for trading or speculative purposes in the past  nor does the company currently anticipate entering into such contracts for trading or speculative purposes in the future 
derivatives used to hedge forecasted transactions and specific cash flows associated with foreign currency denominated financial assets and liabilities which meet the criteria for hedge accounting are designated as cash flow hedges 
consequently  the effective portion of gains and losses is deferred as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and is recognized in earnings at the time the hedged item affects earnings 
contracts that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting are marked to market at each balance sheet date with any resulting gain or loss recognized in income currently as part of net currency transactions 
during and  the company has not used hedge accounting for any of its contracts 
at december   the company held a series of short term currency forward contracts  which mature at various dates through march   to exchange an aggregate of us million for an equivalent amount of canadian dollars at an exchange rate of cdn 
per us dollar 
at december   the actual exchange rate was cdn 
per us dollar 
the estimated fair value of such foreign currency forward contracts was not material at december  the company held no such currency forward contracts at december  and held no other significant derivative contracts at december  or other 
the company believes there may be a certain amount of incompleteness in the sensitivity analyses presented above 
for example  the hypothetical effect of changes in exchange rates discussed above ignores the potential effect on other variables which affect the company s results of operations and cash flows  such as demand for the company s products  sales volumes and selling prices and operating expenses 
accordingly  the amounts presented above are not necessarily an accurate reflection of the potential losses the company would incur assuming the hypothetical changes in exchange rates were actually to occur 
the above discussion and estimated sensitivity analysis amounts include forward looking statements of market risk which assume hypothetical changes in currency exchange rates 
actual future market conditions will likely differ materially from such assumptions 
accordingly  such forward looking statements should not be considered to be projections by the company of future events  gains or losses
