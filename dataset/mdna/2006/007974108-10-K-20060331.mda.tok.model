unless expressly stated or the context otherwise requires  the terms we  our  us  the company and advent refer to advent software  inc and its subsidiaries 
overview we offer integrated software solutions for automating and integrating data and work flows across the investment management organization  as well as the information flows between the investment management organization and external parties 
our products are intended to increase operational efficiency  improve the accuracy of client information and enable better decision making 
each solution focuses on specific mission critical functions of the investment management organization and is tailored to meet the needs of the particular client  as determined by size  assets under management and complexity of the investment environment 
fiscal was characterized by improved financial performance 
revenues of million were up percent from net income was million compared to a loss of million in  an absolute improvement of million 
we also generated million in operating cash flow in  up from million in we were very focused in on delivering many new products as well as upgrades to existing products 
in september  we launched advent portfolio exchange apx  our newest portfolio management and client reporting platform 
during the year we also launched new versions of axys  moxy  advent partner and geneva  as well as a new product to work with geneva  workflow manager 
workflow manager enables system integration and business process automation across multiple systems  addressing a key need of our largest customers 
we added new customers across all product areas during the year  including new geneva clients and new apx clients 
we are also offering geneva in a hosted environment through an agreement reached with paladyne systems  a provider of alternative investment solutions 
we continued our restructuring initiatives which we began in during  we exited one floor of a facility in new york city and recorded total restructuring charges of million 
we also continued to manage our expenses and streamline our operations  reducing headcount from at the end of fiscal to at the end of fiscal as a result  our total cost of revenues and operating expenses decreased to million in from million in during  we moved ahead with the transition in our business model to a term license model from a perpetual model 
under a perpetual pricing model  customers purchase a license to use our software indefinitely and we recognize all license revenue at the time of sale  maintenance is purchased under an annual renewable contract  and recognized ratably over the contract period 
under a term pricing model  customers purchase a license to use our software and receive maintenance for a limited period of time and we recognize the license revenue ratably over the length of the contract 
this has the effect of lowering license revenues in the early stages of the transition  but increasing the total potential value of the customer relationship 
for example  over an eight year period  a customer may enter into two or more contracts for the same software product and services under a term license model 
moving our core business new customer sales to term will have the effect of lowering our revenue growth in and over the next several years 
however  because our products are used by our customers for an average of eight years or more  we believe this change to our business model is extremely significant for the long term growth and value of the business 
during  we recognized approximately of license revenue from term licenses  and signed new term business with a total contract value for license and maintenance of million 
we recognized approximately of this million in bookings as revenue during fiscal  and expect the remainder to be recognized over approximately three years 
looking forward  we continue to focus on improving our long term profitability as we transition to a term license model 
while recent economic trends have been positive and our customers have been more willing to commit to new software purchases  improving our profitability will depend upon our introducing new products  licensing software to new and existing customers  selling services to new and existing customers and renewing maintenance contracts at similar levels to those we achieved during fiscal the success of our transition to a term license model will also depend on future renewal rates  which we will evaluate as our term license contracts expire 
we will continue our focus on aggressively managing costs 
we will also continue to invest in areas we deem appropriate 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements and related notes  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we review the accounting policies used in reporting our financial results on a regular basis 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our process used to develop estimates  including those related to product returns  accounts receivable  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
see note  summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of our accounting policies 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from software licenses  development fees  maintenance  other recurring revenues  professional services and other revenues 
in addition  we earn commissions from customers who use our broker dealer  second street securities  to soft dollar the purchase of non advent products and services with soft dollars 
soft dollaring enables the customers to use the commissions earned on trades to pay all or part of the fees owed to us for non advent products or services  which are initially paid for by second street securities 
the commission revenues earned from soft dollar purchases of non advent products or services are recorded as other revenues in professional services and other revenues on our consolidated statements of operations 
we offer a wide variety of products and services to a large number of financially sophisticated customers 
while many of our lower priced license transactions  maintenance contracts  subscription based transactions and professional services projects conform to a standard structure  many of our larger transactions are complex and may require significant review and judgment in our application of generally accepted accounting principles 
software license and development fees 
we recognize revenue from the licensing of software when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
we generally use a signed license agreement as evidence of an arrangement 
sales through our distributors are evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship together with binding order forms and signed contracts from the distributor s customers 
revenue is recognized once shipment to the distributor s customer has taken place and when all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
delivery occurs when product is delivered to a common carrier fob shipping point 
some of our arrangements include acceptance provisions  and if such acceptance provisions are provided  delivery is deemed to occur upon acceptance 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
we assess whether the collectibility of the resulting receivable is probable based on a number of factors  including the credit worthiness of the customer determined through review of credit reports  our transaction history with the customer  other available information and pertinent country risk if the customer is located outside the united states 
our standard payment terms are due at days or less unless the transaction is part of a soft dollar arrangement through our in house broker dealer subsidiary  second street securities  for which payment is then required within one year  however  payment terms may vary based on the country in which the agreement is executed 
software licenses are sold with maintenance and  frequently  professional services 
licenses 
we have continued our transition from selling mostly perpetual licenses to selling a mix of perpetual and term contracts  and we expect term license revenue to increase as a proportion of total license revenue in the future 
we recognized approximately  and of license revenue from term licenses during fiscal  and  respectively 
revenue recognition for software licensed under perpetual and term based license models differs depending on which type of contract a customer signs perpetual licenses we allocate revenue to delivered components  normally the license component of the arrangement  using the residual method  based on vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of fair value of the undelivered elements generally the maintenance and professional services components  which is specific to us 
we determine the fair value of the undelivered elements based on the historical evidence of the company s stand alone sales of these elements to third parties 
if vsoe of fair value does not exist for any undelivered elements  then the entire arrangement fee is deferred until delivery of that element has occurred 
term licenses term license contract prices include both the software license fees and maintenance fees  and  as a result  we typically allocate of the contract price to license revenue and to maintenance and recurring revenues  based on our assessment of the relative economic value of the two elements 
to date  we have offerred multi year term licenses by which a customer makes a binding commitment to license the software for a fixed multi year term typically three to five years 
for multi year term licenses we have not established vsoe of fair value for the term license and maintenance components  and  as a result  in situations where we are also performing related professional services  we defer all revenue and related expenses under the arrangement until the professional services are substantially complete 
at the point professional services are substantially completed  we recognize a pro rata amount of the term license and maintenance revenue  professional services fees earned and related expenses  based on the elapsed time from the start of the term license to the substantial completion of professional services 
the remaining deferred professional services revenue and related expenses are recognized ratably over the remaining contract length 
term license and maintenance revenue for the remaining contract years is recognized ratably over the remaining period of the contract 
when multi year term licenses are sold and do not include related professional services  we recognize the entire term license and maintenance revenue ratably over the period of the contract term 
in the future  we may offer single year term licenses 
revenue on delivered components will be allocated and recognized using the residual method  based on vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of fair value of the undelivered elements license  maintenance and professional services components  which is specific to us 
while fair value of the undelivered professional services component is based on the historical evidence of the company s stand alone sales of these components to third parties  vsoe for the term license and the related maintenance components will be determined by the stated optional renewal rate 
if vsoe of fair value does not exist for any undelivered elements  then the entire arrangement fee is deferred until delivery of that element has occurred 
development fees are derived from contracts that we have entered into with other companies  including customers and development partners 
agreements for which we receive development fees normally provide for the development of technologies and products that are expected to become part of our general product offerings in the future 
revenues for license development projects are recognized primarily using the percentage of completion method of accounting  based on costs incurred to date compared with the estimated cost of completion  or using the completed contract method  when the development project is finished 
if a customer buys our software and chooses to enter into a soft dollar arrangement through our in house broker dealer subsidiary  second street securities  the soft dollar arrangement does not change or modify the original fixed or determinable fee in the written contract 
the customer is required to pay the original fee for our software within one year 
if insufficient trading volume is generated to pay the entire original fee within one year  the customer is still required to render payment within one year 
if the customer chooses to use a third party broker dealer  the original payment terms apply  regardless of the arrangement with the third party broker dealer 
the option to soft dollar a transaction does not alter the underlying revenue recognition for the transaction  all the revenue recognition criteria listed in the software license section above must be assessed in determining how the revenue will be recognized 
our standard practice is to enforce our contract terms and not allow our customers to return software 
we have  however  allowed customers to return software on a limited case by case basis and have recorded sales returns reserves as offsets to revenue in the period the sales return becomes probable  in accordance with fasb statement no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists 
the estimates for returns are adjusted periodically based upon historical rates of returns and other related factors 
we do have two situations where we provide a contractual limited right of return to end user customers only in shrink wrap license agreements for advent products  and certain microedge products 
the shrink wrap license agreement for advent products provides for a right of return within seven days of delivery of the software 
certain microedge software license agreements allow for either a thirty day money back guarantee or a seven day right of return 
we recognize revenue on delivery since the fee is fixed or determinable  the buyer is obligated to pay  the risk of loss passes to the customer  and we have the ability to estimate returns 
our ability to estimate returns is based on a long history of experience with relatively homogenous transactions and the fact that the return period is short 
we have recorded a sales returns reserve contra revenue account to account for these situations based on our historical experience of million  million  and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
maintenance and other recurring revenues 
we offer annual maintenance programs that provide for technical support and updates to our software products 
maintenance fees are bundled under perpetual licenses in the initial licensing year and charged separately for renewals of annual maintenance in subsequent years 
fair value for maintenance is based upon renewal rates stated in the contracts or  in limited cases  separate sales of renewals to other customers 
generally  we recognize maintenance revenue ratably over the contract term  except in the case of multi year term license contracts which are described in the term licenses section above 
we recognized approximately  and of maintenance and other recurring revenue from term licenses during fiscal  and  respectively 
we offer other recurring revenue services that are either subscription based or transaction based  and primarily include the provision of software interfaces to  and the capability to download securities information from  third party data providers 
we recognize revenue from recurring revenue transactions either ratably over the subscription period or as the transactions occur 
professional services and other revenues 
we offer a variety of professional services that include project management  implementation  data conversion  integration  custom report writing and training 
fair value for professional services is based upon separate sales of these services by us to other customers 
our professional services are generally billed based on hourly rates together with reimbursement for travel and accommodation expenses 
our professional services and other revenue also include revenue from our annual user conferences 
we generally recognize revenue as these professional services are performed  except in the case of multi year term license contracts which are described in the term licenses section above 
certain professional services arrangements involve acceptance criteria 
in these cases  revenue and related expenses are recognized upon acceptance 
effective january   commission revenues received from soft dollar transactions for products and services not related to our products and services  are recorded as other revenues on a net basis as we are not the primary obligor in these transactions 
revenues from these soft dollar transactions are recognized on a trade date basis as securities transactions occur 
our ability to estimate returns for maintenance and professional services is based on a long history of experience with relatively homogenous transactions and the fact that the return period is short 
we have recorded a returns reserve contra revenue account to account for these situations based on our historical experience of million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
income taxes 
we account for worldwide income taxes under an asset and liability approach that requires the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between book and tax bases of assets and liabilities be recognized as deferred tax assets and liabilities 
generally accepted accounting principles require us to evaluate whether or not we will realize a benefit from net deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the net deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized 
significant factors considered by management in assessing the need for a valuation allowance include the following our historical operating results  the length of time over which the differences will be realized  tax planning opportunities  and expectations for future earnings 
in considering whether or not we will realize a benefit from net deferred tax assets  recent losses must be given substantially more weight than any projections of future profitability 
in  we determined that  under applicable accounting principles  based on our history of consecutive losses since the second quarter of  it was more likely than not that we would not realize any value for our net deferred tax assets 
accordingly  we established a valuation allowance equal to of the amount of these assets 
in fiscal and  we continued to maintain a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets except for a deferred tax asset of  in the united kingdom due to our history of losses through fiscal income tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent sufficient positive evidence materializes to support a reversal of  or decrease in  the valuation allowance 
a history of cumulative profitability is generally considered as sufficient positive evidence to support the more likely than not criterion for a decrease in or reversal of a valuation allowance 
impairment of long lived assets 
we review our goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year as of november and more frequently if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment loss has occurred 
we are required to test our goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level 
we have determined that we had five reporting units as of november  the test for goodwill impairment is a two step process the first step compares the fair value of each reporting unit with its respective carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of our reporting unit is considered not impaired  thus the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
the second step  used to measure the amount of impairment loss  compares the implied fair value of each reporting unit s goodwill with the respective carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the process for evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires judgment at many points during the test including future revenue forecasts  discount rates and various reporting unit allocations 
during  there were no events or circumstances which triggered an impairment review 
during the fourth quarter of  we completed our annual impairment test which did not indicate impairment 
therefore  the second step of the impairment test was not necessary to perform 
we review our other long lived assets including property and equipment and other intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative market or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
recoverability is measured by a comparison of the assets carrying amount to their expected future undiscounted net cash flows 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured based on the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
for example  demand for our techfi product line was significantly lower than expected and thus we discontinued certain products within our techfi product line in september as a result  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million in the third quarter of to write off the carrying value of certain techfi related intangible assets 
we hold minority interests in several privately held companies having operations or technology in areas within our strategic focus 
most of these investments can be considered as early stage investment opportunities and are classified as other assets and valued at the lower of cost or fair value on our consolidated balance sheets 
through december   one of these investments had been accounted for under the equity method of accounting as our chief executive officer was a member of this investee s board of directors 
effective december   our chief executive officer resigned her seat on this investee s board of directors and as a result  we no longer believe we have significant influence over this investee 
therefore  this investment is carried at the lower of cost or fair value at december  and  respectively  similar to our other investments 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
we estimate an investment s carrying value using a variety of valuation methodologies 
such methodologies include comparing the private company with publicly traded companies in similar lines of business  applying revenue multiples to estimated future operating results for the private company and estimating discounted cash flows for that company 
restructuring charges and related accruals 
since  we have developed and implemented formalized plans for restructuring our business to better align our resources to market conditions and recorded significant charges 
in connection with these plans  we recorded estimated expenses for severance and benefits  lease cancellations  asset write offs and other restructuring costs 
given the significance of  and the timing of the execution of such activities  this process is complex and involves periodic reassessments of estimates made at the time the original decisions were made  including evaluating real estate market conditions for expected vacancy periods and sub lease rents 
we continually evaluate the adequacy of the remaining liabilities under our restructuring initiatives 
although we believe that these estimates accurately reflect the costs of our restructuring plans  actual results may differ  thereby requiring us to record additional provisions or reverse a portion of such provisions 
acquisitions on may   we acquired the remaining independent distributor businesses from our independent european distributor  advent europe  in the united kingdom and switzerland  as well as certain assets of advent europe 
we made these acquisitions in order to gain direct control over all of our european operations  which we view as an increasingly important market 
the consideration of million consisted of million in cash   of assumed liabilities and  of closing costs 
a total of million of the cash consideration was paid at closing and the remaining million was paid by the company during the second quarter of in addition  we paid an earn out distribution of approximately million under a formula based on revenue bookings  which was recorded as additional goodwill in the second quarter of no further earn out distributions were earned or paid 
the acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and accordingly  the purchase price has been allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities acquired on the basis of their respective fair values on the acquisition date 
the amounts allocated to identifiable intangibles were determined based upon management s estimates using established valuation techniques 
the results of operations of advent united kingdom and advent switzerland are included in the consolidated statement of operations subsequent to the date of acquisition 
the following unaudited pro forma summary presents the consolidated results of operations as if the acquisitions had occurred at the beginning of the periods presented

reclassifications certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation to better reflect our view of the current business

restatement of financial statements in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended december   we determined that our previously issued financial statements contained in the company s annual report on form k a for the year ended december  should be restated to correct an error in those financial statements 
we did not adjust the amortization periods of certain leasehold improvements upon a change in the lease termination date at one of our facilities

license revenues are derived from the licensing of software products  while development fees are derived from development contracts that we have entered into with other companies  including customers and development partners 
maintenance and other recurring revenues are derived from maintenance fees charged in the initial licensing year  renewals of annual maintenance services in subsequent years and recurring revenues derived from our subscription based and transaction based services 
professional services and other revenues include fees for consulting  training services  soft dollaring of third party products and services and our user conferences 
net revenues increased in and due to growing information technology spending by our customers  as well as a general increase in demand for many of our products and services 
the increases reflected improving economic conditions and growth in the financial markets 
the growth in net revenues included increases in license and development fees  maintenance and recurring revenues  as well as increased revenue from international sales 
the increase in also reflected a higher level of professional services and other revenues 
after adverse economic conditions negatively impacted revenues across the industry in and  the economy stabilized in and continued to strengthen into  resulting in shorter sales cycles  growing investment in information technology projects  and a general increase in expenditures for software related services 
going forward  we expect normal seasonal weakness to impact revenues in the first quarter of  followed by modest growth as the year progresses 
however  we also expect a continued challenging business environment and limited ability to forecast revenue over the near term  particularly with respect to license revenue  as we continue our transition to a term license model 
international sales  which are based on the location to which the product is shipped  also contributed to our growth in and  representing of our net revenues in  compared to in and in we expect growth to continue in fiscal  especially in the emea region 
the revenues from customers in any single international country did not exceed of total revenues 
each of the major revenue categories has historically varied as a percentage of net revenues and we expect this variability to continue in future periods 
this variability is partially due to the timing of the introduction of new products  the relative size and timing of individual licenses  as well as the size of the implementation  the resulting proportion of the maintenance and professional services components of these license transactions and the amount of client use of pricing and related data 
license and development fees in thousands  except percentages license and development fees    percent of net revenues change over prior year   percent change over prior year the increase in license and development fee revenues in and primarily reflected the improving economic and industry conditions resulting in increased capital spending by our customers 
improving financial markets in these periods resulted in a more favorable business climate as our customers were more willing to commit to new software purchases as well as existing customer upgrades 
for each of the periods presented  the advent office including axys  moxy  partner and qube and geneva products accounted for the majority of license revenue 
license and development fee revenues in also reflected an increase in geneva related assets under administration aua revenues and increasing term license revenues as our transition to a term model continued 
our aua revenues increased by million during as a result of the growth in assets under administration of certain fund administration clients  whose geneva contracts provide for quarterly fees based on assets  resulting in significant recurring quarterly revenue 
while perpetual license revenue decreased million due to our transition towards selling more contracts on a term basis  revenue recognized from term license deals increased million 
the increase in was primarily due to higher license fees totaling million from sales of axys  partner  moxy  qube  geneva and other associated products  particularly with larger customers 
in addition  we had significant overall revenue growth from our microedge segment product lines of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
we typically license our products on a per server  per user basis with the price per customer varying based on the selection of the products licensed  the number of site installations  the number of authorized users  the size of the customer and the customer s line of business 
our pricing can vary in different market segments to maintain our competitive position 
we earn development fees when we provide product solutions that are not part of our standard product offering but that will be incorporated into our future releases 
for fiscal years  and  revenue from development fees has been or less of total license and development fees revenue 
for fiscal years  and  revenues generated from advent product and services paid for through soft dollar transactions engaged by our second street securities subsidiary represented less than of total license and development fees revenue 
we expect license and development fees revenues to be down slightly in as we continue our transition to a term model 
as we sell more products on a term license model  we defer a greater portion of license revenue over the term of the contract  instead of recognizing the license revenue up front 
the net effect  assuming most customers renew their contracts upon expiration of the initial term  is to build a long term license and maintenance stream and also enhance predictability over the long run 
maintenance and other recurring revenues in thousands  except percentages maintenance and other recurring revenues    percent of net revenues change over prior year   percent change over prior year the increase in maintenance and other recurring revenues in reflected new maintenance support contracts as a result of new license deals  price increases to our installed customer base  an increase in demand for our data services and an increase in our recurring revenue stream 
maintenance revenues increased by million to million in reflecting an increase in new maintenance support contracts as a result of the increase in the number of new license deals both perpetual and term and price increases to our installed customer base 
recurring revenues increased by million to million in primarily reflecting increases of million from a revenue sharing arrangement and increased revenue from our advent custodial data services of million 
maintenance revenues increased by million to million in due to higher volume and price increases 
recurring revenues increased by million to million in primarily reflecting an increase of million from a revenue sharing arrangement  increased revenue from our advent custodial data services of million offset partially by a decline in our overall outsourcing revenue of million 
we expect that maintenance and recurring revenues will continue to increase due to new maintenance contracts and price increases in  but at a lower growth rate than professional services and other revenues in thousands  except percentages professional services and other revenues    percent of net revenues change over prior year   percent change over prior year our consulting and other professional services revenues are generally proportional to sales of our software products  which increased in and the increase in professional services and other revenues in was primarily due to a general increase in volume of consulting and training services demanded as a result of higher license sales  resulting in general consulting and training revenues increasing by million 
the decrease in professional services and other revenue in was primarily due to lower revenues earned from third party products paid for through soft dollar transactions of approximately million  partially offset by increased revenue from our custom work of million as a result of higher license sales 
the decline in revenues from soft dollar transactions resulted from our change in revenue classification from our second street securities subsidiary when they engage in the soft dollaring of third party products 
effective january   we recognize revenue from these transactions on a net basis 
as a result  we recorded revenues on a net basis from soft dollaring of third party products in of million  which was a decrease of million from  when revenue was recognized on a gross basis 
we expect that professional services and other revenues will increase moderately in due to planned deferral into future periods of professional services revenues on term deals 
increases or decreases in consulting and other professional services revenues generally lag corresponding increases or decreases in license revenues by one quarter or more  and can also be affected by specific project milestone completions 
revenues by segment in thousands advent investment management    microedge    other    total    we have two reportable segments advent investment management aim and microedge 
aim derives revenues from the development  marketing and sale of software products  data interfaces and related maintenance and services that automate  integrate and support certain mission critical functions of investment management organizations 
microedge derives revenues from the sale of software and services for grant management  gifts matching and volunteer tracking for the grant making community worldwide

aim s revenue increases in and also reflected an increase in new maintenance support contracts as a result of new license deals and price increases for maintenance contracts from our installed customer base  partially offset by attrition from within our existing installed customer base 
we also had growth in international sales in both periods  partly attributable to our acquisitions in the uk and switzerland in may our assets under administration revenues increased by million in  as a result of the growth in assets under administration for our fund administration clients  where certain geneva contracts provide for quarterly fees based on assets  resulting in significant recurring revenue 
the technology spending patterns of organizations in microedge s primary markets independent foundations  community foundations and corporations are directly affected by economic fluctuations as foundation budgets are largely driven by endowment income 
given that endowments often contain market exposed components  they are significantly affected by the economy 
for instance  foundation spending decreases in an economic downturn 
community foundations are subject to similar influences  compounded by the fact that in many cases much of their ongoing funding and endowment comes from active donors who may increase or reduce their giving depending on the economic climate and the related effect on their income and wealth 
corporations typically fund charitable activities from operating budgets  and the allocation to charitable donations and supporting company charitable operations is often closely tied to a company s performance 
thus  corporate philanthropy and spending on related technology are correlated with company and overall economic performance 
the and increases in microedge revenues in fiscal and  respectively  also reflected the improved economic conditions and growth in the financial markets which resulted in increased charitable contributions 
this increase in charitable contributions received by the foundations sector in these periods enabled foundations to increase their information technology expenditures which resulted in the increase in microedge revenues

the increase in was primarily due to higher compensation expense of million as a result of our incurring a full year of payroll expense from additional headcount related to our acquisitions in the united kingdom and switzerland in may  and additional costs of million from our annual user conference 
the decrease in primarily reflected lower cost of revenues from third party products paid for through soft dollar transactions of million and a decrease in other outside service costs of million  partially offset by an increase in salaries of million related to increased consulting and services associated with our higher levels of revenue and increased headcount following our acquisitions in the united kingdom and switzerland  and an increase in bonuses of million 
the decline in cost of revenues from soft dollar transactions resulted from our change in revenue classification from our second street securities subsidiary when they engage in the soft dollaring of third party products 
other revenues and cost of revenues for fiscal have been changed to reflect revenue recognition on a net basis from these transactions 
this change impacted cost of professional services and other by a total of million in fiscal we anticipate cost of professional services and other revenues in to increase over as we expect to increase the number of implementations we perform  the majority of which will be sold on a term basis

marketing expenses increased million primarily as a result of our apx product launch 
these increases were partially offset by decreases of million in bad debt and royalty expenses and million in outside services associated with decreased utilization of external consultants 
the decrease in expenses in fiscal was due primarily to decreased compensation expense of million resulting from our restructuring activities initiated in to lower headcount by consolidating our sales organizations

once technological feasibility is reached  all software costs should be capitalized until the product is made available for general release to customers 
the capitalized costs will be amortized using the greater of the ratio of the products current gross revenues to the total of current expected gross revenues or on a straight line basis over the software s estimated economic life of approximately three years 
the decrease in was due primarily to the capitalization of software development costs of million during during  we had several major products  including apx  in their final beta phase 
the remaining decrease in product development expense in was due to lower compensation expense as a result of lower headcount from restructuring activities in and the decrease in expenses in was due primarily to a decline in compensation expense of million as a result of our restructuring activities initiated in and lower costs incurred for outside contractors of million 
we expect product development expenses in to increase moderately in support of continued and new product development compared with rapid technological advances in hardware and software development  evolving standards in computer hardware and software technology  changing customer needs and frequent new product introductions and enhancements characterize the software markets in which we compete

the increase in professional fees was primarily due to an increase in legal fees of million for various inquiries and disputes  including our ongoing litigation with the former shareholders of kinexus  costs of million to settle the claims of certain former members and employees of advent outsource data management  and additional accounting costs of million for our year end audit of financial statements and internal controls and other associated compliance costs 
the increase in personnel and related costs of million in was primarily due to severance for terminated employees and a full year of payroll expense from additional headcount related to our acquisitions of our remaining independent distributor businesses in the united kingdom and switzerland in may the increase in outside services of million was primarily due to costs associated with increased utilization of outside contractors 
the increase in computer and telecom expense was primarily due to a voice ip phone system that was implemented during these increases in general and administrative expenses during were partially offset by decreased facility expense as a result of our restructuring activities to reduce excess office space 
the increase in was primarily due to increased accounting and compliance costs associated with the sarbanes oxley act of million  fixed asset disposal losses of million  and a rent expense adjustment of million incurred in we expect general and administrative expenses to be down significantly in compared with  as we expect legal and professional fees to decrease in  and do not expect several items from to recur including certain severance payments  the advent outsource legal settlement of million and associated legal fees

our cash provided by operating activities generally follows the trend in our net revenues and operating results 
cash provided by operating activities of million during fiscal primarily consisted of our net income of million and non cash charges including depreciation and amortization of million 
other sources of cash included increases in accrued liabilities of million and deferred revenues of million 
the increase in accrued liabilities primarily reflected increases in accrued bonuses and accrued legal fees 
the increase in deferred revenues reflected new maintenance contracts  existing maintenance contracts renewed at higher prices  and more contracts signed on a term model 
these sources of cash were offset by net non operating gains on investments of million primarily resulting from a gain on sale of a private equity investment of million and decreases in deferred income taxes of million and income taxes payable of million 
the decrease in deferred income taxes reflected the amortization of foreign deferred tax liabilities

our net loss during fiscal was more than offset by non cash charges 
other sources of cash during fiscal included decreases in accounts receivable  prepaid and other assets  income taxes receivable and increases in accrued liabilities and deferred revenues 
the decrease in accounts receivable reflected strong collections during the year 
days sales outstanding decreased to at december  from at december  the decrease in prepaid and other assets reflected prepaid expense amortization and collection of a receivable for a litigation settlement recorded in the fourth quarter of the decrease in income taxes receivable reflected the receipt of a federal income tax refund 
the increase in accrued liabilities was primarily due to restructuring charges recorded for facilities vacated during the year 
the increase in deferred revenues reflected new maintenance contracts  existing maintenance contracts renewed at higher prices  and more contracts signed on a term model 
our net loss in was significantly offset by non cash charges 
significant sources of cash during included a decrease in accounts receivable 
we expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors including fluctuations in our net revenues and operating results  amount of revenue deferred resulting from our shift from a perpetual to term license model  collection of accounts receivable  and timing of payments

our liquidity and capital resources in any period could be affected by the exercise of outstanding stock options and issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
the resulting increase in the number of outstanding shares could also affect our per share results of operations 
however  we cannot predict the timing or amount of proceeds from the exercise of these securities  or whether they will be exercised at all 
furthermore  cash reserves may be used to continue our common stock repurchase activity 
at december   we had million in working capital  down from million at december  we currently have no significant capital commitments other than net commitments under our operating leases  which declined from million at december  to million at december   as a result of lease payments made during the course of fiscal and to a lesser extent sub leasing one floor of our new york facilities as part of our restructuring activities

as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
we have taken numerous actions over the last several years to strengthen our cash position and balance sheet and to improve our ability to generate positive cash flow from operating activities 
many of these actions were taken in the last half of in order to offset the negative impacts of the economic downturn and decreased information technology spending which negatively impacted our net revenues 
we expect that for the foreseeable future  our operating expenses will continue to constitute a significant use of cash flow 
in addition  we may use cash to fund acquisitions or invest in other businesses 
based upon our past performance and current expectations  we believe that our cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital needs  capital expenditures  investment requirements  stock repurchases and financing activities for the foreseeable future

sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values  beginning with the first interim or annual period after june   with early adoption encouraged 
the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
in april  the sec subsequently adopted a new rule delaying compliance with sfas r until the beginning of our next fiscal year  instead of the next reporting period  that begins after june  under the sec s recent rule  we are required to adopt sfas r in our first quarter of fiscal  beginning january  under sfas r  we must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at date of adoption 
the transition method includes prospective and retroactive adoption methods 
under the retroactive method  prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented 
the prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas r  while the retroactive method would record compensation expense for all unvested stock options and restricted stock beginning with the first period restated 
we will adopt the prospective method in the first quarter of fiscal and expect that the compensation charges under sfas r will have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations and earnings loss per share

this statement applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle and changes required by an accounting pronouncement where no specific transition provisions are included 
sfas requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
retrospective application is limited to the direct effects of the change  the indirect effects should be recognized in the period of the change 
this statement carries forward without change the guidance contained in opinion for reporting the correction of an error in previously issued financial statements and a change in accounting estimate 
however  sfas redefines restatement as the revising of previously issued financial statements to reflect the correction of an error

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
historically  much of our revenues and capital spending was transacted in us dollars 
however  since the acquisitions of advent denmark  advent norway  advent sweden  advent netherlands  and advent europe s remaining distributors in the united kingdom and switzerland  whose revenues  with the exception of geneva transactions and capital spending  are transacted in local country currencies  we have greater exposure to foreign currency fluctuations 
we do not believe that a hypothetical change in foreign currency exchange rates would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
our interest rate risk relates primarily to our investment portfolio  which consisted of million in cash equivalents and million in marketable securities as of december  an immediate sharp increase in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the fair value of our investment portfolio 
conversely  immediate sharp declines in interest rates could seriously harm interest earnings of our investment portfolio 
we do not currently use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio  nor hedge for these interest rate exposures 
by policy  we limit our exposure to longer term investments  and the majority of our investment portfolio at december  and had interest rate maturities of less than one year 
as a result of the relatively short duration of our portfolio  an immediate hypothetical parallel shift to the yield curve of plus basis points bps  bps and bps would result in a reduction of   and  respectively  in the market value of our investment portfolio as of december  we have also invested in several privately held companies  most of which can still be considered in the start up or development stages 
these non marketable investments are classified as other assets on our consolidated balance sheets 
our investments in privately held companies could be affected by an adverse movement in the financial markets for publicly traded equity securities  although the impact cannot be directly quantified 
these investments are inherently risky as the market for the technologies or products these privately held companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize 
it is our policy to review investments in privately held companies on a regular basis to evaluate the carrying amount and economic viability of these companies 
this policy includes  but is not limited to  reviewing each of the companies cash position  financing needs  earnings revenue outlook  operational performance  management ownership changes and competition 
the evaluation process is based on information that we request from these privately held companies
