item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction terra industries inc terra or the company produces and markets nitrogen products for agricultural and industrial markets with production facilities located in north america and the united kingdom 
during december  the company acquired mississippi chemical corporation mcc 
nitrogen products are commodity chemicals that are sold at prices reflecting global supply and demand conditions 
the nitrogen products industry has cycles of oversupply  resulting in lower prices and idled capacity  followed by supply shortages  resulting in high selling prices and higher industry wide 
table of contents production rates 
to be viable in this industry  a producer must be among the low cost suppliers in the markets it serves and have a financial position that can sustain it during periods of oversupply 
natural gas is the most significant raw material in the production of nitrogen products 
north american natural gas costs have increased substantially since since some of the company s products compete with nitrogen products imported from regions with lower natural gas costs  the company and other north american producers have not always been able to increase selling prices to levels necessary to cover the natural gas cost increases 
this has resulted in curtailments of north american nitrogen production 
these curtailments contributed to reductions in global nitrogen product supplies 
imports  most of which are produced at facilities with access to fixed price natural gas supplies  account for a significant portion of united states of america us nitrogen product supply 
imported products natural gas costs have been and could continue to be substantially lower than the delivered cost of natural gas to our facilities 
off shore producers are most competitive in regions close to north american points of entry for imports  including the gulf coast and east coast 
the company s sales volumes depend primarily on its plants operations and imports from plnl 
the company may purchase product from other manufacturers or importers for resale  however  gross margins on those volumes have historically been insignificant 
profitability and cash flows from the company s nitrogen products business are affected by the company s ability to manage its costs and expenses other than natural gas  most of which do not materially change for different levels of production or sales 
other factors affecting the company s nitrogen products results include the number of planted acres  transportation costs  weather conditions particularly during planting season  grain prices and other variables described in item business and item properties 
the company also produces methanol in the us similar to nitrogen products  methanol is a commodity chemical manufactured from natural gas 
consequently  natural gas costs and the supply demand balance for methanol significantly affect methanol earnings and cash flows 
a significant portion of us methanol demand is met by imports from regions with natural gas costs lower than those available to us producers 
us methanol demand has declined over the past year and is expected to continue to decline due to reduced us consumption of mtbe  a gasoline oxygenate and octane enhancer that uses methanol as a feedstock 
in december  the company entered into contracts with the methanex corporation methanex assigning it the company s sales contracts and providing it exclusive rights to all methanol production at the beaumont facility for five years as more fully described in item business and item properties 
as permitted under these contracts  methanex elected to shut down the beaumont facility as of december  as long as the beaumont  texas facility remains idle through the december termination of the methanex contract  the company may realize revenues relating to the facility of up to million per year due to million from annual amortization of deferred revenues plus one half of the annual cash margin based on the plant s methanol production capacity  methanol reference prices and natural gas costs 
due to the high cost of natural gas  there was no cash margin realized during during the fourth quarter of  the company temporarily suspended all production at the woodward  oklahoma facility  ammonia production at the yazoo city  mississippi facility and ammonia production at the billingham  teeside facility in the uk these temporary suspensions of production were due to the high cost of natural gas during the period 

table of contents overview of consolidated results the company s revenues were billion  billion and billion during  and  respectively 
terra generated net income loss of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
diluted income loss per share was  and in  and  respectively 
income loss from operations was in  million in and million in revenues for increased million as compared to  primarily due to the mississippi chemical corporation mcc acquisition in december and higher sales prices 
the sales prices were higher as a result of increased demand and lower supplies primarily due to reduced production capacity in north america 
costs associated with the mcc revenues and higher natural gas prices were the primary factors that increased cost of sales by million in as compared to the company recognized million of earnings from equity in unconsolidated affiliates during  primarily as a result of equity investments acquired in the mcc acquisition 
during  the company recorded a million loss million  net of tax on the early repayment of debt and an million gain million  net of tax on change in fair value of warrants issued 
the net income was increased by million of income tax benefits due to a favorable settlement with a foreign taxing authority 
the net income also included million attributable to an insurance recovery of product claim costs representing million of operating income less million of related income taxes and a million loss from the early retirement of long term debt representing million of losses less million of related income taxes 
during  the company recorded a million net charge for the impairment of its blytheville  arkansas facility representing a million impairment charge to operating income less million allocated to minority interest and million of income tax benefit 
the net loss was reduced by million of income tax benefits for a reduced assessment by a foreign taxing authority and reversals of tax reserves that had been provided in prior years 
other fluctuations to the company s income loss from continuing operations for  and were primarily related to increases in the selling prices of nitrogen products  decreases in methanol sales due to an exclusivity agreement with methanex and changes in the cost of natural gas  the company s primary raw material for manufacturing its products 
factors that affect operating results factors that may affect the company s operating results include the relative balance of supply and demand for nitrogen fertilizers  industrial nitrogen and methanol  the availability and cost of natural gas  the number of agriculture planted acres which is affected by both worldwide demand and government policies  the types of crops planted  the effect of general weather patterns on the timing and duration of field work for crop planting and harvesting  the effect of environmental legislation on supply and demand for the company s products  the availability of financing sources to fund seasonal working capital needs  and the potential for interruption to operations due to accidents or natural disasters 
the principal raw material used to produce nitrogen products and methanol is natural gas 
natural gas costs in and accounted for approximately and  respectively  of the company s total 
table of contents manufacturing costs and expenses 
a significant increase in the price of natural gas that is not hedged or recovered through an increase in the price of the company s nitrogen and methanol products would have an adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
a portion of global nitrogen products and methanol production is at facilities with access to fixed price natural gas supplies that have been  and could continue to be  substantially lower priced than natural gas costs at the company s north american and uk facilities 
the company s facility at point lisas nitrogen limited  an unconsolidated subsidiary  is located in trinidad with access to such lower cost natural gas 
the company enters into forward pricing contracts for some of its natural gas requirements when such arrangements would not result in costs greater than expected north american and uk selling prices for the company s finished products 
the company s december  forward positions covered of the company s expected natural gas requirements excluding the natural gas requirements of point lisas nitrogen limited which purchases its gas under contract with the natural gas company of trinidad and tobago 
prices for nitrogen products are influenced by the world supply and demand balance for ammonia and other nitrogen based products 
long term demand is affected by population growth and rising living standards that determine food consumption 
short term demand is affected by world economic conditions  international trade decisions and grain prices 
supply is affected by increasing worldwide capacity and the availability of nitrogen product exports from major producing regions such as the former soviet union  the middle east and south america 
methanol is used as a raw material in the production of formaldehyde  methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe  acetic acid and numerous other chemical derivatives 
the price of methanol is influenced by the supply and demand for each of these products 
environmental initiatives to ban or reduce the use of mtbe as a fuel additive  such as those currently underway in the united states  could affect demand for methanol 
weather can have a significant effect on demand for the company s nitrogen products 
weather conditions that delay or intermittently disrupt field work during the planting and growing seasons may cause agricultural customers to use forms of nitrogen fertilizer that are more or less favorable to the company s products 
weather conditions following harvest may delay or eliminate opportunities to apply fertilizer in the fall 
weather can also have an adverse effect on crop yields  which lowers the income of growers and could affect their ability to pay for crop inputs purchased from the company s dealer customers 
the company s nitrogen business segment is seasonal  with the majority of nitrogen products consumed during the second quarter in conjunction with spring planting activity 
due to the business seasonality and the relatively brief periods during which customers consume nitrogen products  the company and its customers generally build inventories during the second half of the year in order to ensure product availability during the peak sales season 
for the company s current level of sales  it may require lines of credit to fund inventory increases and to support customer credit terms 
the company believes that its credit facilities are adequate for expected sales levels 
the company s manufacturing operations may be subject to significant interruption if one or more of its facilities were to experience a major accident or were damaged by severe weather or other natural 
table of contents disaster 
the company currently maintains insurance  including business interruption insurance  which it believes is sufficient to allow it to recover from major damage to any of its facilities 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires estimates and judgments that affect the amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses as of the date of the financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that reflect significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
derivative and financial instruments the company enters into derivative financial instruments  including swaps  basis swaps and put and call options  to manage the effect of changes in natural gas costs  to manage the prices of its nitrogen products and to manage foreign currency risk 
the company reports the fair value of the derivatives on its balance sheet 
if the derivative is not designated as a hedging instrument  changes in fair value are recognized in earnings in the period of change 
if the derivative is designated as a hedge  and to the extent such hedge is determined to be effective  changes in fair value are either a offset by the change in fair value of the hedged asset or liability or b reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the period of change  and subsequently recognized in the determination of net income in the period the offsetting hedged transaction occurs 
if an instrument is settled early  any gains or losses are immediately recognized as adjustments to earnings 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of a transaction exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable  no obligations remain and collectibility is probable 
revenues are primarily comprised of sales of the company s products  including any realized hedging gains or losses related to nitrogen product derivatives  and are reduced by estimated discounts and trade allowances 
revenues include amounts related to shipping and handling charges to the company s customers 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value 
the cost of inventories is determined by using the first in  first out method 
the company performs a monthly analysis of its inventory balances to determine if the carrying amount of inventories exceeds their net realizable value 
the analysis of estimated realizable value is based on customer orders  market trends and historical pricing 
if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated net realizable value  the carrying amount is reduced to the estimated net realizable value 

table of contents equity investments equity investments are carried at original cost adjusted for the company s proportionate share of the investees income  losses and distributions 
the company periodically assesses the carrying value of its equity investment and will record a loss on equity investments when a decline in the fair value of the investment that is other than temporary exists 
pension assets and liabilities pension assets and liabilities are affected by the estimated market value of plan assets  estimates of the expected return on plan assets and discount rates 
actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets will affect the amount of pension expense ultimately recognized 
the company s pension projected benefit obligation was million at december   which was million higher than pension plan assets 
the december  liability was computed based on an average discount rate  which was based on yields for high quality corporate bonds with a maturity approximating the duration of the company s pension liability 
in addition  the pension liability for its uk pension plan  which includes provisions to adjust benefit payments for general inflation rates  was estimated based on an average annual inflation rate 
declines in comparable bond yields or higher uk inflation rates would increase the company s pension liability 
the company s net pension liability  after deduction of plan assets  could increase or decrease depending on the extent to which returns on pension plan assets are lower or higher than the discount rate 
post retirement benefits post retirement benefits are determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by assumptions including the discount rate and expected trends in health care costs 
changes in the discount rate and differences between actual and expected health care costs could affect the recorded amount of post retirement benefits expense ultimately recognized 
deferred income taxes deferred income tax assets and liabilities reflect a differences between financial statement carrying amounts and corresponding tax bases and b temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
deferred tax assets also include the expected benefits of carrying forward the company s net operating losses 
the company regularly reviews deferred tax assets for recoverability and reduces them if the company cannot sufficiently determine that they will be realized 
the company bases this determination on projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
at december   deferred tax assets representing future benefits for the company s us net operating loss carryforwards totaled million 
if there is a material change in the effective tax rates or time period when temporary differences become taxable or deductible  the company may have to additionally reduce all or a significant portion of its deferred tax assets 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets the company reviews and evaluates its long lived assets for impairment when events and changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of its asset may not be recoverable 
impairment is considered to exist if the total estimated future cash flows on an undiscounted basis are less than the carrying value of the asset 
future cash flows include estimates of production levels  pricing of the company s products  costs of natural gas and capital expenditures 
if the assets are impaired  a calculation of fair value is performed  if the fair value is less than the carrying value of the assets  the assets are reduced to their fair value 
during  events occurred that indicated that the carrying amount of the beaumont  texas assets may not be recoverable 
as of december   the beaumont assets had a carrying value  net of million of deferred revenues  of approximately million 
the company estimated the remaining useful life of the beaumont facility at years  assuming normal investment in maintenance and replacement capital throughout this year period 
the estimated cash flows over this year period were based on the company s best estimate of future market and operating conditions at december  the estimated cash flows exceeded the carrying value of the beaumont assets  therefore  no impairment charge was recorded 
the cash flow estimates were made with the assumption that the beaumont facility will remain idle through  the term of the company s contract with methanex  and that once restarted  the beaumont facility will produce at historic rates and selling prices will be adequate to realize historic margins 
results of continuing operations compared with consolidated results the company reported net income of million on revenues of billion compared with a net income of million on revenues of billion 
diluted income per share for was compared with for the net income included a million million  net of tax loss related to the early retirement of debt and a million million  net of tax gain relating to change in fair value of warrants 
the net income included million of income tax benefits due to a favorable settlement with a foreign taxing authority  million of income attributable to an insurance recovery of product claim costs representing million of operating income less million of related income taxes and a million loss from the early retirement of long term debt representing million of losses less million of related income taxes 
the company classifies its operations into two business segments nitrogen products and methanol 
the nitrogen products segment represents the sale of nitrogen products including that produced at the company s ammonia manufacturing and upgrading facilities 
the methanol segment represents sales of methanol including that produced at the company s two methanol manufacturing facilities

higher selling prices contributed million to revenues as the result of increased demand and lower fertilizer supplies due to reduced production capacity in north america 
sales volumes in were higher than those of the previous year due primarily to the mcc acquisition 
nitrogen products operating income decreased by million to million for from million for operating income in from the mcc business totaled million  but was more than offset by lower nitrogen margins on other operations and the absence of the million insurance recovery of product claim costs 
nitrogen margins declined principally as the result of increases to natural gas costs that outpaced selling price changes 
natural gas costs increased million from as unit costs  net of forward pricing gains and losses  and were per million british thermal units mmbtu during compared to mmbtu during as a result of forward price contracts  natural gas costs for the nitrogen products segment were million lower than spot prices 

table of contents methanol methanol revenues were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively

table of contents nitrogen products revenues increased by million to  million for compared with  million for primarily as the result of higher sales prices 
selling prices were higher as the result of increased demand and lower fertilizer supplies caused by industry wide production curtailments since mid price increases also reflected higher imported product costs as the result of us currency declines relative to other currencies and increased international freight rates 
sales volumes in were lower than those of the previous year due mostly to the blytheville production facility s permanent closure in may nitrogen products operating income  excluding charges for the impairment of long lived assets  increased by million to million for from million for higher selling prices and recovery of product claim costs contributed million and million  respectively  to operating income 
theses factors were partly offset by higher natural gas costs and increased expenses 
natural gas costs increased million from as unit costs  net of forward pricing gains and losses  were per million british thermal units during compared to mmbtu during as a result of forward price contracts  natural gas costs for the nitrogen products segment were million lower than spot prices 
selling  general and administrative expenses assigned to the nitrogen products business segment totaled million for compared to million for the increase is primarily due to incentive pay accruals based on net income  professional fees associated with sarbanes oxley compliance and changes in the allocation methods of centralized expense centers between the nitrogen products and methanol business segments 
during  million of the company s selling  general and administrative expenses were allocated to the methanol business segment 
those allocations were discontinued in as a result of contracts transferring the marketing rights for our methanol production to methanex 
impairment of long lived assets during  the company recorded a million charge for the impairment of the blytheville  arkansas facility as it concluded that future market conditions may not justify ongoing investment in the maintenance and replacement capital required to operate the blytheville facility for its established useful life 
the blytheville production capabilities were permanently closed in may methanol methanol revenues were million for the year ended december  approximately of methanol revenues were realized under a contract providing methanex with exclusive rights to all methanol production at our beaumont  texas facility 
that contract was executed in december and requires the company to sell the beaumont production to methanex at a price which will generally approximate cash production costs 
in addition  methanex pays the company one half of the cash margin attributable to beaumont s production based on realized methanol prices and actual natural gas costs 
other contract related revenues include amounts received at signing that are deferred and recognized over the life of the contract on a straight line basis

the company s pension obligation could increase or decrease based on actual uk inflation rates 
the company s cash contributions to pension plans were million in and are estimated at million in actual contributions could vary from these estimates depending on actual returns for plan assets  legislative changes to pension funding requirements and or plan amendments 
expenditures related to environmental  health and safety regulation compliance are primarily composed of operating costs that totaled million in because environmental  health and safety regulations are expected to continue to change and generally to be more restrictive than current requirements  the costs of compliance will likely increase 
the company does not expect compliance with such regulations will have a material adverse effect on the results of operations  financial position or net cash flows 
the company incurred million of capital expenditures to ensure compliance with environmental  health and safety regulations 
the company may be required to install additional air and water quality control equipment  such as low nitrous oxide burners  scrubbers  ammonia sensors and continuous emission monitors to continue to achieve compliance with the clean air act and similar requirements 
these equipment requirements typically apply to competitors as well 
the company estimates that the cost of complying with these existing requirements in  and and beyond will be less than million in the aggregate

sfas r requires measurement of all employee stock based compensation awards using a fair value method and the recording of such expense in the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  the adoption of sfas r requires additional accounting related to the income tax effects and disclosure regarding the cash flow effects resulting from share based payment arrangements 
in january  the united states securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 which provides supplemental implementation guidance for sfas r 
sfas r is effective for the company s first quarter of fiscal the company has selected the black scholes option pricing model as the most appropriate fair value method for its awards and will recognize compensation cost on a straight line basis over its awards vesting periods 
the adoption of sfas r will not have a material impact on the company s results of operation 
however  uncertainties  including the company s future stock based compensation strategy  stock price volatility  estimated forfeitures and employee stock option exercise behavior  make it difficult to determine whether the stock based compensation expense that the company will incur in future periods will be similar to the sfas pro forma disclosed in the notes to consolidated financial statements

table of contents the company s policy is to avoid unnecessary risk and to limit  to the extent practical  risks associated with operating activities 
the company s management may not engage in activities that expose the company to speculative or non operating risks and is expected to limit risks to acceptable levels 
the use of derivative financial instruments is consistent with the company s overall business objectives 
derivatives are used to manage operating risk within the limits established by our board of directors  and in response to identified exposures  provided they qualify as hedge activities 
as such  derivative financial instruments are used to manage exposure to interest rate fluctuations  to hedge specific assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency  to hedge firm commitments and forecasted natural gas purchase transactions  to set a floor for nitrogen selling prices and to protect against foreign exchange rate movements between different currencies that impact revenue and earnings expressed in us dollars 
the use of derivative financial instruments subjects the company to some inherent risks associated with future contractual commitments  including market and operational risks  credit risk associated with counterparties  product location basis differentials and market liquidity 
the company continuously monitors the valuation of identified risks and adjusts the portfolio based on current market conditions 
foreign currency fluctuations the company s policy is to manage risk associated with foreign currency fluctuations by entering into forward exchange and option contracts covering specific currency obligations or net foreign currency operating requirements  as appropriate 
such hedging is limited to the amounts and duration of the specific obligations being hedged and  in the case of operating requirements  no more than of the forecasted requirements 
the primary currencies to which the company is exposed are the canadian dollar and the british pound

north american natural gas requirements for are approximately million mmbtu 
the company has hedged of its expected north american requirements and none of its requirements beyond december  the fair value of these instruments is estimated based  in part  on quoted market prices from brokers  realized gains or losses and the company s computations 
these instruments and other natural gas positions fixed natural gas prices at million more than published prices for december  forward markets 
market risk is estimated as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in price 
as of december  the company s market risk exposure related to future natural gas requirements being hedged was million based on a sensitivity analysis 
changes in the market value of these derivative instruments have a high correlation to changes in the spot price of natural gas 
since the company enters into forward pricing agreements for only a portion of its natural gas requirements  this hypothetical adverse impact on natural gas derivative instruments could be more than offset by lower costs for all natural gas it purchases
