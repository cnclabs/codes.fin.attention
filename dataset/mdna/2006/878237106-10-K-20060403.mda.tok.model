item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a asset management 
while we sell products in various countries throughout the world  and product categories may vary from region to region  over the past three years  sales within our consolidated product categories have remained fairly consistent within the following ranges peripherals systems networking software we generated approximately of our consolidated net sales in fiscal from products purchased from hp compared to  and of consolidated net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
there were no other vendors that accounted for or more of our consolidated net sales in fiscal  or customers and services we purchase products directly from manufacturers and publishers in large quantities for sale to an active reseller base of more than  vars  direct marketers  retailers and corporate resellers 
while we sell products in various countries throughout the world  and customer channels may vary from region to region  over the past three years  sales within our consolidated customer channels have remained fairly consistent within the following ranges vars direct marketers and retailers corporate resellers no single customer accounted for more than five percent of our net sales during fiscal  or the market for vars is attractive because vars generally rely on distributors as their principal source of computer products and financing 
this reliance is due to vars typically lacking the resources to establish a large number of direct purchasing relationships or stock significant product inventories 
direct marketers  retailers and corporate resellers may establish direct relationships with manufacturers and publishers for their more popular products  but utilize distributors as the primary source for other product requirements and the alternative source for products acquired directly 
we have also developed special programs to meet the unique needs of direct marketers and retailers 
in addition to a strong product offering  we provide resellers a high level of customer service through our training and technical support  suite of electronic commerce tools including internet order entry and edi services  customized shipping documents  product configuration integration services and access to flexible financing programs 
we also provide services to our vendors by giving them the opportunity to participate in a number of special promotions  and marketing services targeted to the needs of our resellers 
while we believe that services such as these help to set us apart from our competition  they contribute less than to our overall revenues 

table of contents we provide our vendors with one of the largest bases of resellers throughout the americas and emea  delivering products to customers from our regionally located logistics centers 
we have located our logistics centers near our customers which enables us to deliver products on a timely basis  thereby reducing the customers need to invest in inventory see also item properties for further discussion of our locations and logistics centers 
sales and electronic commerce currently  our sales force consists of approximately  field and inside telemarketing sales representatives 
our sales force is provided comprehensive training regarding our policies and procedures and technical characteristics of our products 
these training programs are supplemented by product seminars offered by manufacturers and publishers 
field sales representatives are located in major metropolitan areas 
each field sales representative is supported by inside telemarketing sales teams covering a designated territory 
our team concept provides a strong personal relationship between our customers representatives and tech data 
territories with no field representation are serviced exclusively by the inside telemarketing sales teams 
customers typically call our inside sales teams on dedicated toll free numbers or contact us through various electronic methods to place orders 
if the product is in stock and the customer has available credit  customer orders are generally shipped the same day from the logistics center nearest the customer or the intended end user 
increasingly  customers rely upon our electronic ordering and information systems  in addition to our product catalogs and frequent mailings  as sources for product information  including availability and price 
our on line computer systems allow the inside sales teams to check current stocking levels in the company s logistics centers 
through our website  most customers can gain remote access to our information systems to check product availability and pricing and to place orders 
certain of our larger customers have edi services available whereby orders  order acknowledgments  invoices  inventory status reports  customized pricing information and other industry standard edi transactions are consummated on line  which improves efficiency and timeliness for ourselves and our customers 
during fiscal  approximately billion of our consolidated net sales originated from orders received electronically  compared to approximately billion in fiscal and approximately billion in fiscal competition we operate in a market characterized by intense competition  based upon such factors as product availability  credit availability  price  delivery and various services and support provided by the distributor to the customer 
we believe that we are well equipped to compete effectively with other distributors in all of these areas 
we compete against several distributors in the americas market  including ingram micro inc  synnex corp  and several regional and local distributors 
the competitive environment within emea is highly fragmented  with market share spread among many regional and local competitors such as actebis  and international distributors such as ingram micro inc and westcon comstor 
we also compete  in some cases  with manufacturers and publishers who sell directly to resellers and end users 
however  we may become a business partner to these companies by providing supply chain or other services tailored to the it market 
we believe manufacturers and publishers will generally continue to sell their products through distributors rather than directly due to our ability to provide suppliers with access to our broad customer base in a highly efficient manner 
our network of logistics centers and our sales and product management expertise worldwide allow our suppliers to benefit by lowering their selling and inventory costs 
employees on january   we had approximately  employees 
certain of our employees in various countries outside of the united states are subject to laws providing representation rights to employees on workers councils 
we consider relations with our employees to be good 
foreign and domestic operations and export sales we operate predominately in a single industry segment as a distributor of it products  logistics management  and other value added services 
while we operate primarily in one industry  because of our global presence  we manage our business based on our geographic segments 
our geographic segments include the americas united states  canada  latin america and export sales to the caribbean and emea europe  middle east  and export sales to africa 
in fiscal   and   and  respectively  of our consolidated net sales were derived from operations outside of the united states 

table of contents over the last three fiscal years  we have entered new markets or expanded our presence in existing markets and exited certain markets based upon our assessment of  among other factors  risk and earnings potential 
we continue to evaluate our risk exposure eg  risks surrounding currency rates  regulatory environments  political instability  etc 
and earnings potential around the world 
to the extent we decide to close additional operations  we may incur charges and operating losses related to such closures  write off a portion of our emea goodwill or recognize a portion of our accumulated other comprehensive income loss as a non operating foreign currency exchange gain or loss see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the geographical distribution of our net sales  operating income  depreciation and amortization  capital expenditures  identifiable assets and goodwill

table of contents item a 
risk factors the following are certain risk factors that could affect our business  financial position and results of operations 
these risk factors should be considered in connection with evaluating the forward looking statements contained in this annual report on form k because these factors could cause the actual results and conditions to differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
before you buy our common stock or other securities  you should know that making such an investment involves risks  including the risks described below 
the risks that have been highlighted below are not the only risks of our business 
if any of the risks actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected 
in that case  the trading price of our common stock or other securities could decline  and you may lose all or part of your investment 
certain risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our forward looking statements include the following competition the company operates in a highly competitive environment 
the computer wholesale distribution industry is characterized by intense competition  based primarily on product availability  credit availability  price  speed of delivery  ability to tailor specific solutions to customer needs  quality and depth of product lines and training  service and support 
weakness in demand in the market intensifies the competitive environment in which the company operates 
the company competes with a variety of regional  national and international wholesale distributors  some of which have greater financial resources than the company 
the company also faces competition from companies entering or expanding into the logistics and product fulfillment and e commerce supply chain services market 
narrow profit margins as a result of intense price competition in the industry  the company has narrow gross profit and operating profit margins 
these narrow margins magnify the impact on operating results attributed to variations in sales and operating costs 
future gross profit and operating margins may be adversely affected by changes in product mix  vendor pricing actions and competitive and economic pressures 
in addition  failure to attract new sources of business from expansion of products or services or entry into new markets may adversely affect future gross profit and operating margins 
dependence on information systems the company is highly dependent upon its internal computer and telecommunication systems to operate its business 
there can be no assurance that the company s information systems will not fail or experience disruptions  that the company will be able to attract and retain qualified personnel necessary for the operation of such systems  that the company will be able to expand and improve its information systems  that the company will be able to convert to new systems efficiently  or that the company will be able to integrate new programs effectively with its existing programs 
any of such problems could have an adverse effect on the company s business 
restructuring activities in may  the company initiated a restructuring program in the emea region 
we may experience delays or greater than expected costs in implementing our restructuring program  and our efforts may fail to achieve the desired improvements in our emea operating and gross profit margins 
changes in organizational structure  personnel  job duties and processes related to this restructuring program will require significant management resources and may reduce productivity during implementation of the program 
because the company operates with narrow operating margins and gross profit margins  lower productivity could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  particularly if it occurs during seasonal peaks in our business 
acquisitions as part of its growth strategy  the company pursues the acquisition of companies that either complement or expand its existing business 
as a result  the company regularly evaluates potential acquisition opportunities  which may be material in size and scope 
acquisitions involve a number of risks and uncertainties  including expansion into new geographic markets and business areas  the requirement to understand local business practices  the diversion of management s attention to the assimilation of the operations and personnel of the acquired companies  the possible requirement to upgrade the acquired companies management information systems to the company s standards  potential adverse short term effects on the company s operating results and the amortization or impairment of any acquired intangible assets 

table of contents exposure to natural disasters  war  and terrorism the company s headquarters facilities and some of its logistics centers as well as certain vendors and customers are located in areas prone to natural disasters such as floods  hurricanes  tornadoes  or earthquakes 
in addition  demand for the company s services is concentrated in major metropolitan areas 
adverse weather conditions  major electrical failures or other natural disasters in these major metropolitan areas may disrupt the company s business should its ability to distribute products be impacted by such an event 
the company operates in multiple geographic markets  several of which may be susceptible to acts of war and terrorism 
the company s business could be adversely affected should its ability to distribute products be impacted by such events 
the company and many of its suppliers receive parts and products from asia and operate in many parts of the world that may be susceptible to disease or epidemic that may disrupt the company s ability to receive or deliver products or other disruptions in operations 
dependence on independent shipping companies the company relies on arrangements with independent shipping companies  such as federal express and united parcel service  for the delivery of its products from vendors and to customers 
the failure or inability of these shipping companies to deliver products  or the unavailability of their shipping services  even temporarily  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the company may also be adversely affected by an increase in freight surcharges due to rising fuel costs and added security 
there can be no assurance that tech data will be able to pass along the full effect of an increase in these surcharges to its customers 
labor strikes the company s labor force is currently non union with the exception of employees of certain european and latin american subsidiaries  which are subject to collective bargaining or similar arrangements 
the company does business in certain foreign countries where labor disruption is more common than is experienced in the united states and some of the freight carriers used by the company are unionized 
a labor strike by a group of the company s employees  one of the company s freight carriers  one of its vendors  a general strike by civil service employees  or a governmental shutdown could have an adverse effect on the company s business 
many of the products the company sells are manufactured in countries other than the countries in which the company s logistics centers are located 
the inability to receive products into the logistics centers because of government action or labor disputes at critical ports of entry may have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
risk of declines in inventory value the company is subject to the risk that the value of its inventory will decline as a result of price reductions by vendors or technological obsolescence 
it is the policy of most of the company s vendors to protect distributors from the loss in value of inventory due to technological change or the vendors price reductions 
some vendors  however  may be unwilling or unable to pay the company for price protection claims or products returned to them under purchase agreements 
moreover  industry practices are sometimes not embodied in written agreements and do not protect the company in all cases from declines in inventory value 
no assurance can be given that such practices to protect distributors will continue  that unforeseen new product developments will not adversely affect the company  or that the company will be able to successfully manage its existing and future inventories 
product availability the company is dependent upon the supply of products available from its vendors 
the industry is characterized by periods of severe product shortages due to vendors difficulties in projecting demand for certain products distributed by the company 
when such product shortages occur  the company typically receives an allocation of product from the vendor 
there can be no assurance that vendors will be able to maintain an adequate supply of products to fulfill all of the company s customer orders on a timely basis 
failure to obtain adequate product supplies could have an adverse effect on the company s business 
vendor terms and conditions the company relies on various rebates  cash discounts  and cooperative marketing programs offered by its vendors to support expenses associated with distributing and marketing the vendors products 
currently  the rebates and purchase discounts offered by vendors are influenced by sales volumes and percentage increases in sales  and are subject to changes by the vendors 
additionally  certain of the company s vendors subsidize floorplan financing arrangements for the benefit of our customers 
terminations of a supply or services agreement or a significant change in supplier terms or conditions of sale could negatively affect our operating margins  revenue or the level of capital required to fund our operations 

table of contents the company receives a significant percentage of revenues from products it purchases from relatively few manufacturers 
as has historically been the case  a manufacturer may make rapid  significant and adverse changes in its sales terms and conditions  such as reducing the amount of price protection and return rights as well as reducing the level of purchase discounts and rebates they make available to us  or may merge with or acquire other significant manufacturers 
the company s gross margins could be materially and negatively impacted if the company is unable to pass through the impact of these changes to the company s customers or cannot develop systems to manage ongoing supplier programs 
in addition  the company s standard vendor distribution agreement permits termination without cause by either party upon days notice 
the loss of a relationship with any of the company s key vendors  a change in their strategy such as increasing direct sales  the merging of significant manufacturers  or significant changes in terms on their products may adversely effect the company s business 
loss of significant customers customers do not have an obligation to make purchases from the company 
in some cases  the company has made adjustments to its systems  vendor offerings  and processes  and made staffing decisions  in order to accommodate the needs of a significant customer 
in the event a significant customer decides to make its purchases from another distributor  experiences a significant change in demand from its own customer base  becomes financially unstable  or is acquired by another company  the company s receipt of revenues may be significantly affected  resulting in an adverse effect on the company s business 
customer credit exposure the company sells its products to a large customer base of value added resellers  direct marketers  retailers and corporate resellers 
the company finances a significant portion of such sales through trade credit 
as a result  the company s business could be adversely affected in the event of a deterioration of the financial condition of its customers  resulting in the customers inability to repay the company 
this risk may increase if there is a general economic downturn affecting a large number of the company s customers and in the event the company s customers do not adequately manage their business or properly disclose their financial condition 
need for liquidity and capital resources  fluctuations in interest rates the company s business requires substantial capital to operate and to finance accounts receivable and product inventory that are not financed by trade creditors 
the company has historically relied upon cash generated from operations  bank credit lines  trade credit from its vendors  proceeds from public offerings of its common stock and proceeds from debt offerings to satisfy its capital needs and finance growth 
the company utilizes various financing instruments such as receivables securitization  leases  revolving credit facilities and trade receivable purchase facilities 
as the financial markets change and new regulations come into effect  the cost of acquiring financing and the methods of financing may change 
changes in our credit rating or other market factors may increase our interest expense or other costs of capital  or capital may not be available to us on acceptable terms to fund our working capital needs 
the company will continue to need additional financing  including debt financing 
the inability to obtain such sources of capital could have an adverse effect on the company s business 
the company s credit facilities contain various financial and other covenants that may limit the company s ability to borrow or limit the company s flexibility in responding to business conditions 
these financing instruments involve variable rate debt  thus exposing the company to risk of fluctuations in interest rates 
such fluctuations in interest rates could have an adverse effect on the company s business 
foreign currency exchange risks  exposure to foreign markets the company conducts business in countries outside of the united states  which exposes the company to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company may enter into short term forward exchange or option contracts to hedge this risk  nevertheless  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse effect on the company s business 
in particular  the value of the company s equity investment in foreign countries may fluctuate based upon changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
these fluctuations  which are recorded in a cumulative translation adjustment account  may result in losses in the event a foreign subsidiary is sold or closed at a time when the foreign currency is weaker than when the company initially invested in the country 

table of contents the company s international operations are subject to other risks such as the imposition of governmental controls  export license requirements  restrictions on the export of certain technology  political instability  trade restrictions  tariff changes  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  changes in the interpretation and enforcement of laws in particular related to items such as duty and taxation  difficulties in collecting accounts receivable  longer collection periods and the impact of local economic conditions and practices 
there can be no assurance that these and other factors will not have an adverse effect on the company s business 
potential asset impairments from declines in operating performance the company assesses potential impairments to long lived assets  including property and equipment  certain deferred tax assets  certain intangible assets and other long lived assets  when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the company assesses potential impairments to indefinite lived intangible assets  including goodwill and deferred tax assets  at least annually and more frequently if current events and circumstances indicate a possible impairment 
the company s operations in the emea region have been considerably more challenging as a result of somewhat weaker demand in certain countries in europe and slowing it demand 
as a result  the company has launched a formal restructuring program for the emea region 
should the operating performance in emea not improve  the company may be required to recognize an impairment charge related to its long lived and or indefinite lived assets 
a significant impairment loss could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results for the period during which the impairment is recorded 
changes in income tax and other regulatory legislation the company operates in compliance with applicable laws and regulations 
when new legislation is enacted with minimal advance notice  or when new interpretations or applications of existing laws are made  the company may need to implement changes in its policies or structure 
in addition  recent legislation requires all member states of the european union to adopt the european directive ec regarding waste in electrical and electronic equipment weee directive and ec regarding restrictions of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment rohs directive into national law 
the manner and timing of adoption of these laws may impact the company as it remains unclear to what extent the company will be deemed a producer subject to compliance with these regulations and the financial costs and guarantees thereby required 
the company makes plans for its structure and operations based upon existing laws and anticipated future changes in the law 
the company is susceptible to unanticipated changes in legislation  especially relating to income and other taxes  import export laws  hazardous materials and electronic waste recovery legislation  and other laws related to trade  accounting  and business activities 
such changes in legislation  both domestic and international  may have a significant adverse effect on the company s business 
changes in accounting rules the company prepares its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
these accounting principles are subject to interpretation by the financial accounting standards board  the public company accounting oversight board  the securities and exchange commission  the american institute of certified public accountants and various other bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting policies 
a change in these policies or a new interpretation of an existing policy could have a significant effect on our reported results and may affect our reporting of transactions before a change is announced 

table of contents volatility of common stock price because of the foregoing factors  as well as other variables affecting the company s operating results  past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance  and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
in addition  the company s participation in a highly dynamic industry often results in significant volatility of the common stock price 
some of the factors that may affect the market price of the common stock  in addition to those discussed above  are changes in investment recommendations by securities analysts  changes in market valuations of competitors and key vendors  and fluctuations in the overall stock market  but particularly in the technology sector

table of contents overview tech data is a leading distributor of information technology it products  logistics management and other value added services 
we distribute microcomputer hardware and software products to value added resellers  corporate resellers  direct marketers and retailers 
our offering of value added customer services includes training and technical support  external financing options  configuration services  outbound telemarketing  marketing services and a suite of electronic commerce solutions 
we manage our business in two geographic segments the americas includes the united states  canada  latin america and export sales to the caribbean and emea includes europe  the middle east and export sales to africa 
our strategy is to leverage our efficient cost structure combined with our multiple service offerings to generate demand and cost efficiencies for our suppliers and customers around the world 
the it distribution industry in which we operate is characterized by narrow gross profit as a percentage of sales gross margin and narrow income from operations as a percentage of sales operating margin 
historically  our gross and operating margins have been impacted by intense price competition  as well as changes in terms and conditions with our suppliers  including those terms related to rebates and other incentives and price protection 
we expect these competitive pricing pressures to continue in the foreseeable future  and therefore  we will continue to evaluate our pricing policies and terms and conditions offered to our customers in response to changes in our vendors terms and conditions and the general market environment 
as we continue to evaluate our existing pricing policies and make future changes  if any  we may experience moderated sales growth or sales declines 
in addition  increased competition and changes in general economic conditions within the markets in which we conduct business may hinder our ability to maintain and or improve gross margin from its current level 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  in order to dedicate strategic efforts and resources to core growth opportunities  we made the decision to sell the emea training business the training business 
in march  we closed the sale of the training business to a third party for total cash consideration of million and million of additional consideration which is contingent upon the satisfaction of certain post closing conditions 
our results of operations for the training business have been reclassified and presented as income loss from discontinued operations  net of tax in our consolidated statement of operations for all periods presented 
the reclassification of the training business had the effect of reducing previously reported gross margin and sg a as a percentage of sales by approximately 
to 
of consolidated net sales for all periods restated 
the impact on previously reported operating margin was relatively insignificant 
the assets and liabilities of the training business have not been reclassified in our january  consolidated balance sheet as the net assets of the training business are less than of the total consolidated net assets of the company 
from a balance sheet perspective  we require working capital primarily to finance accounts receivable and inventory 
we have historically relied upon debt  trade credit from our vendors  and accounts receivable financing programs for our working capital needs 
we believe our balance sheet at january  was one of the strongest in the industry  with a debt to capital ratio calculated as total debt divided by the aggregate of total debt and total shareholders equity of 
our business continues to perform well in the americas  however  we have been disappointed with our results in emea 
in may  in response to a weaker demand environment in emea  we announced a formal restructuring program for our emea operations further discussed below 
we believe our challenges in the emea region over the last several quarters are the result of a combination of factors  including somewhat weaker demand conditions in certain countries  competitive pricing pressures  declining average selling prices and  most notably  the diverted focus of our management team in the region 
specifically  the combined effect of the completion of the final phases of our comprehensive it systems upgrade and harmonization project  further integration of our azlan operations and  most recently  the implementation of our emea restructuring program  diverted the focus of our management team in the region from executing appropriate pricing  purchasing and sales management practices 
we are beginning to see the benefits from our actions to restructure and optimize our operations in the emea region 
these actions have included engaging external consultants to provide a fresh perspective and detailed recommendations  such as the implementation of a new  simplified emea management organizational structure  assigning dedicated resources across the region to improve our pricing  purchasing and sales management practices  and implementing our restructuring program 
in addition  both the azlan integration and our it systems upgrade and harmonization project were substantially complete at the end of fiscal  which is expected to alleviate further diversion of management resources to these initiatives 

table of contents with respect to our restructuring program  we have recorded charges for workforce reductions and the optimization of facilities and systems 
excluding external consulting costs  total cash charges associated with the restructuring program are estimated to be in the range of million to million  comprised of to million related to workforce reductions and to million related to the optimization of facilities and systems 
we expect initiatives related to the restructuring program to generate annualized savings in the same range 
through january   the company has incurred million related to the restructuring program  comprised of approximately million related to workforce reductions and approximately million for facility costs 
the remaining charges are expected to be incurred over the next three quarters with all us dollar amounts being approximated using an exchange rate of 
euros per us dollar 
costs related to the restructuring program have been funded by operating cash flows and our credit facilities 
costs recorded in each quarter may vary depending upon the timing of certain actions 
the costs related to this restructuring program  other than the external consulting costs  are reflected within the consolidated statement of operations as restructuring charges  which is a component of operating income 
in addition  during the nine months ended january   the company incurred approximately million of external consulting costs related to the restructuring program 
these consulting costs are included in selling  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations 
the company expects to continue to incur external consulting costs related to the restructuring program in fiscal these consulting costs  along with the costs of internal personnel dedicated to the implementation of the restructuring program and other incremental costs indirectly related to the restructuring program  will partially offset the savings we expect to realize from the emea restructuring program during fiscal year see further discussion below and in note of notes to consolidated financial statements for related discussion of our restructuring program 
critical accounting policies and estimates the information included within md a is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures 
on an on going basis  we evaluate these estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventory  vendor incentives  goodwill and intangible assets  deferred taxes  and contingencies 
our estimates and judgments are based on currently available information  historical results  and other assumptions we believe are reasonable 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivable we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
in estimating the required allowance  we take into consideration the overall quality and aging of the receivable portfolio  the existence of credit insurance and specifically identified customer risks 
also influencing our estimates are the following the large number of customers and their dispersion across wide geographic areas  the fact that no single customer accounts for more than of our net sales  the value and adequacy of collateral received from customers  if any and our historical loss experience 
if actual customer performance were to deteriorate to an extent not expected by us  additional allowances may be required which could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial results 
inventory we value our inventory at the lower of its cost or market value  with cost being determined on the first in  first out method 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon an aging analysis of the inventory on hand  specifically known inventory related risks such as technological obsolescence and the nature of vendor terms surrounding price protection and product returns  foreign currency fluctuations for foreign sourced product  and assumptions about future demand 
market conditions or changes in terms and conditions by our vendors that are less favorable than those projected by management may require additional inventory write downs  which could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial results 
vendor incentives we receive incentives from vendors related to cooperative advertising allowances  infrastructure funding  volume rebates and other incentive agreements 
these incentives are generally under quarterly  semi annual or annual agreements with the vendors  however  some of these incentives are negotiated on an ad hoc basis to support specific programs mutually developed with the vendor 
unrestricted volume rebates and early payment discounts received from vendors are recorded as a reduction of inventory upon receipt of funds and as a reduction of cost of products sold as the related inventory is sold 
incentives received from vendors for specifically identified cooperative advertising programs and infrastructure funding are recorded as adjustments to selling  general and administrative expenses  and any reimbursement in excess of the related cost is recorded in the same manner as unrestricted volume rebates  as discussed above 

table of contents actual rebates may vary based on volume or other sales achievement levels  which could result in an increase or reduction in the estimated amounts previously accrued 
we also provide reserves for receivables on vendor programs for estimated losses resulting from vendors inability to pay or rejections of claims by vendors 
should amounts recorded as outstanding receivables from vendors be uncollectible  additional allowances may be required which could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial results 
goodwill  intangible assets and other long lived assets the carrying value of goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment and may also be reviewed more frequently if current events and circumstances indicate a possible impairment 
an impairment loss is charged to expense in the period identified 
we also examine the carrying value of our intangible assets with finite lives  which includes capitalized software and development costs  purchased intangibles  and other long lived assets as current events and circumstances warrant determining whether there are any impairment losses 
if indicators of impairment are present and future cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the assets carrying amount  an impairment loss is charged to expense in the period identified 
factors that may cause a goodwill  intangible asset or other long lived asset impairment include negative industry or economic trends and significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results 
our valuation methodologies include  but are not limited to  estimating the net present value of the projected cash flows of our reporting units 
if actual results are substantially lower than our projections underlying these assumptions  or if market discount rates substantially increase  our future valuations could be adversely affected  potentially resulting in future impairment charges 
income taxes we record valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
in assessing the adequacy of a recorded valuation allowance  we consider all positive and negative evidence and a variety of factors including  the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  historical and projected future taxable income  and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
if we determine we would be able to use a deferred tax asset in the future in excess of its net carrying value  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be made to reduce income tax expense  thereby increasing net income in the period such determination was made 
should we determine that we are unable to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be made to income tax expense  thereby reducing net income in the period such determination was made 
however  the recognition of any future tax benefit resulting from the reduction of the million valuation allowance associated with the purchase of azlan would be recorded as a reduction of goodwill 
contingencies we accrue for contingent obligations  including estimated legal costs  when the obligation is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable 
as facts concerning contingencies become known  we reassess our position and make appropriate adjustments to the financial statements 
estimates that are particularly sensitive to future changes include those related to tax  legal  and other regulatory matters such as imports and exports  the imposition of international governmental controls  changes in the interpretation and enforcement of international laws in particular related to items such as duty and taxation  and the impact of local economic conditions and practices  which are all subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation process

products purchased from hp generated  and of our net sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
there were no other manufacturers or publishers that accounted for or more of our net sales in the past three years

our performance in the americas is primarily due to stronger sales to direct marketers and retailers and a general improvement in demand for it products and services compared to the prior year  somewhat offset by declining average selling prices of many products we sell 
as previously discussed in this md a  our performance in emea can be attributed to a combination of factors  including somewhat weaker demand conditions in certain countries  competitive pricing pressures resulting in declining average selling prices and  most notably  the diverted focus of our management team in the region 
during fiscal  we saw our consolidated net sales grow to billion  a increase over fiscal this growth can be attributed to strong demand in both the americas and emea 
our performance within emea was further enhanced by the strengthening of the euro versus the us dollar  which contributed approximately half of the sales growth we reported in 
table of contents the region 
our sales growth in emea was also positively impacted in fiscal from the inclusion of twelve months of operations of azlan compared to including only ten months of operations in fiscal azlan  one of the leading european distributors of networking and communications equipment  was acquired by tech data in march our legacy operations ie  excluding azlan in emea also experienced sales growth in the high single digits  reflecting the strong demand for it products during the fiscal year 
gross profit gross profit as a percentage of net sales gross margin during fiscal was  a decrease from in fiscal the decrease in gross margin is primarily attributable to the highly competitive pricing environment and operational challenges in our emea operations  as discussed above  and to a much lesser extent  changes in customer and product mix in both emea and the americas 
we continuously evaluate our pricing policies and terms and conditions offered to our customers in response to changes in our vendors terms and conditions and the general market environment 
as we continue to evaluate our existing pricing policies and make future changes  if any  we may experience moderated sales growth or sales declines 
in addition  increased competition and changes in general economic conditions within the markets in which we conduct business may hinder our ability to maintain and or improve gross margin from its current level 
gross margin during fiscal was  compared to in fiscal this decrease is the result of the highly competitive pricing environment in both the americas and emea  partially offset by the effect of emerging issues task force no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor eitf issue no 

eitf issue no 
requires  under certain circumstances  consideration received from vendors be treated as a reduction of cost of goods sold and not as a reduction of selling  general and administrative expenses 
eitf issue no 
further requires the recognition of such consideration be deferred until the related inventory is sold 
as the guidance was applicable only to vendor arrangements entered into or modified subsequent to december   it was effective for all vendor arrangements throughout fiscal  however  it had only a partial impact during fiscal as a result  gross margin in fiscal included basis points of vendor consideration reclassified from selling  general and administrative expenses compared to basis points being reclassified in fiscal in addition to the impact of eitf issue no 
 the inclusion of a full twelve months of azlan s results which generates higher gross margins than our legacy operations in fiscal compared to ten months in fiscal also positively affected our gross margin comparisons on a year over year basis  however this impact was far less than the impact of eitf issue no 
operating expenses selling  general and administrative expenses sg a sg a as a percentage of net sales decreased to in fiscal  compared to in fiscal the decrease in sg a as a percentage of net sales in fiscal is the result of continuing cost savings initiatives and improvements in productivity  particularly in emea  where we are beginning to realize the benefits associated with our restructuring efforts 
also contributing to our decrease in sg a is a reduction in credit costs due to favorable credit experience and the positive resolution of contingencies associated with certain customer accounts 
we strive to continuously improve our business model through our constant monitoring of costs  including tight budgetary controls and productivity reviews 
these productivity reviews result in a variable cost model with an ability to better respond to changes in market demand compared to those companies with high fixed costs 
in absolute dollars  worldwide sg a decreased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in fiscal is primarily due to the benefits realized from the restructuring program and the decrease in credit costs  partially offset by million of external consulting costs incurred related to our emea restructuring program  an increase in labor costs in the americas to support the additional sales and  to a lesser extent  a stronger us dollar versus the euro in fiscal compared to fiscal sg a as a percentage of net sales decreased to in fiscal  compared to in fiscal this decrease is the result of continuing costs savings initiatives and improvements in productivity  offset in part by the effects of eitf issue no 
in absolute dollars  sg a increased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal this increase is attributable to the continued strengthening of the euro against the us dollar and the implementation of eitf issue no 
 as discussed above 
excluding these factors  sg a actually declined in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of our tight budgetary controls and productivity reviews 

table of contents restructuring charges as discussed earlier in this md a  in may  we announced a formal restructuring program to better align the emea operating cost structure with the current business environment 
in connection with this restructuring program  we continue to record charges for workforce reductions and the optimization of facilities and systems 
for the year ended january   we incurred million related to the restructuring program  comprised of approximately million related to workforce reductions and approximately million for facility costs 
special charges during fiscal  we incurred special charges of million  or 
of net sales  related to the closure of our education business in the united states and the restructuring of this business to a more variable cost based  outsourced model 
these charges primarily include costs associated with employee severance  facility lease terminations and the write off of fixed assets associated with the business 
interest expense  discount on sale of accounts receivable  interest income  foreign currency exchange gains losses interest expense increased to million in fiscal compared to million in the prior year 
the increase in interest expense during fiscal is primarily due to additional working capital requirements resulting from higher sales volume and an increase in our average short term borrowing rate compared to the prior fiscal year 
interest income increased to million in fiscal from million in the prior year 
the increase in interest income during fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily attributable to higher interest rates earned on short term cash investments compared to the prior fiscal year 
discounts on the sale of accounts receivable totaled million in fiscal the discount is associated with the accounts receivable purchase facility agreements executed in fiscal see further discussion below in this md a and in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in interest expense is primarily due to additional working capital requirements resulting from higher sales volume  as well as a higher interest rate environment in the us in fiscal compared to fiscal interest income decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease is primarily due to a decrease in cash available for investment in fiscal as compared to fiscal we realized a net foreign currency exchange loss of million during fiscal and net foreign currency exchange gains of million and million during fiscal years and  respectively 
we recognize net foreign currency exchange gains and losses primarily due to the fluctuation in the value of the us dollar versus the euro  and to a lesser extent  versus other currencies 
it continues to be our goal to minimize foreign currency exchange gains and losses through an effective hedging program 
our hedging policy prohibits speculative foreign currency exchange transactions 
provision for income taxes our effective tax rate for continuing operations was in fiscal and in fiscal the increase in the effective tax rate during fiscal is primarily the result of a million increase in the deferred tax valuation allowance on deferred tax assets recorded during the second quarter of fiscal related to deferred tax assets for specific jurisdictions in emea  primarily germany 
while we believe the restructuring efforts will improve the operating performance within our german operations  we have determined this charge to be appropriate due to cumulative losses expected to be realized through the current fiscal year  after considering the effect of implementing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
in the future  to the extent we generate consistent taxable income within those operations currently requiring the valuation allowance  we may reduce the valuation allowance on the related deferred tax assets  thereby reducing tax expense and increasing net income in the same period 
the underlying net operating loss carryforwards remain available to offset future taxable income in the specific jurisdictions requiring the valuation allowance  subject to applicable tax laws and regulations 
excluding the effect of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance  our effective tax rate for continuing operations would have approximated for fiscal the increase in the tax rate from in fiscal adjusted for the reversal of previously accrued income taxes as discussed below to in fiscal was primarily the result of annual losses incurred in certain tax jurisdictions where we are not able to record a tax benefit 
on an absolute dollar basis  the provision for income taxes increased to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal primarily as a result of the factors discussed above 
our effective tax rate for continuing operations was in fiscal compared to in fiscal the decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily attributable to the reversal of previously accrued income taxes of million due to the 
table of contents favorable resolution of various income tax examinations during the fourth quarter of fiscal excluding the reversal of previously accrued income taxes  our effective tax rate for continuing operations would have approximated during fiscal on an absolute dollar basis  the provision for income taxes increased to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal  primarily due to an increase in our taxable income and the factors discussed above 
the effective tax rate differed from the us federal statutory rate of during these periods for the reasons discussed above  as well as tax rate benefits of certain earnings from operations in lower tax jurisdictions throughout the world for which no us taxes have been provided because such earnings are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the us our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates  changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities or changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof 
in addition  our income tax returns are subject to continuous examination by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
at january   we believe we have appropriately accrued for probable income tax exposures 
to the extent we prevail in matters for which accruals have been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of such accruals  our effective tax rate in a financial reporting period could be materially affected 
income loss from discontinued operations  net of tax results of operations for the training business have been reclassified and presented as income loss from discontinued operations  net of tax  within the consolidated statement of operations for all periods presented 
we realized income from discontinued operations  net of tax  of million and million in fiscal and  respectively  and a loss from discontinued operations  net of tax  of million in fiscal impact of inflation we have not been adversely affected by inflation 
management believes that most price increases could be passed on to our customers  as prices charged by us are not set by long term contracts  however  as a result of competitive pressure  there can be no assurance that the full effect of any such price increases could be passed on to our customers 
quarterly data seasonality our quarterly operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and will likely continue to do so in the future as a result of currency fluctuations and seasonal variations in the demand for the products and services we offer 
narrow operating margins may magnify the impact of these factors on our operating results 
recent historical seasonal variations have included a reduction of demand in emea during our second and third fiscal quarters followed by an increase in emea demand during our fiscal fourth quarter 
given that a significant portion of our revenues are derived from emea  the worldwide results closely follow the seasonality trends in emea 
additionally  the life cycles of major products  as well as the impact of future acquisitions and dispositions  may also materially impact our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our quarterly results 
liquidity and capital resources our discussion of liquidity and capital resources includes an analysis of our cash flows and capital structure  which includes both continuing and discontinued operations for all periods presented 
the absence of cash flows from discontinued operations is not expected to affect the company s future liquidity

we have several key metrics we use to manage our working capital  including our cash conversion cycle also referred to as net cash days and owned inventory levels 
our net cash days are defined as days sales outstanding in accounts receivable dso plus days of supply on hand in inventory dos  less days of purchases outstanding in accounts payable dpo 
owned inventory is calculated as the difference between our inventory and accounts payable balances divided into the inventory balance 
our net cash days improved by approximately to days at the end of fiscal compared to days at the end of fiscal  resulting from improved management of our worldwide cash conversion cycle 
our owned inventory level the percentage of inventory not financed by vendors was a negative at the end of fiscal  meaning our accounts payable balances exceeded our inventory balances by 
this compares to negative owned inventory of at the end of fiscal net cash provided by operating activities decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal due primarily to the timing of payments to vendors  offset in part by increased earnings over the prior year especially within our emea segment 
our net cash days improved by approximately to days at the end of fiscal compared to days at the end of fiscal  resulting from improved management of our worldwide cash conversion cycle 
our owned inventory level was a negative at the end of fiscal compared to negative owned inventory of at the end of fiscal the following table presents the components of tech data s cash conversion cycle  in days  as of january   and as of january  days of sales outstanding days of supply in inventory days of purchases outstanding cash conversion cycle days net cash used in investing activities of million during fiscal was primarily attributable to the continuing investment related to the expansion and upgrading of our it systems  office facilities and equipment for our logistics centers 
we expect to make total capital expenditures of approximately million during fiscal for equipment and machinery in our logistics centers  office facilities and it systems 
while we believe we will realize increased operating efficiencies as a result of these investments  unforeseen circumstances or complexities could have an adverse impact on our business 
net cash used in investing activities of million during fiscal was attributable to the continuing investment related to the expansion and upgrading of our it systems  office facilities and equipment for our logistics centers  offset by the proceeds from the sale of one of the facilities at our headquarters campus in clearwater  florida

as of january   we maintained a million receivables securitization program with a syndicate of banks  which expires in august we pay interest average rate of at january  on the receivables securitization program at designated commercial paper rates plus an agreed upon margin 
additionally  we maintained a million multi currency 
table of contents revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks that expires in march we pay interest average rate of at january  under this facility at the applicable euro rate plus a margin based on our credit ratings 
in addition to these credit facilities  we maintained lines of credit and overdraft facilities totaling approximately million at january  average interest rate was at january  
the total capacity of the aforementioned credit facilities was approximately billion  of which million was outstanding at january  our credit agreements contain limitations on the amounts of annual dividends and repurchases of common stock 
additionally  the credit agreements require compliance with certain warranties and covenants on a continuing basis 
the financial ratio covenants contained within the credit agreements include a debt to capitalization ratio  an interest to ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  deprecation and amortization ratio  and a tangible net worth requirement 
at january   we were in compliance with all such covenants 
the ability to draw funds under these credit facilities is dependent upon sufficient collateral in the case of the receivables securitization program and meeting the aforementioned financial covenants  which may limit our ability to draw the full amount of these facilities 
as of january   the maximum amount that could be borrowed under these facilities  in consideration of the availability of collateral and the financial covenants  was approximately billion 
at january   we had issued standby letters of credit of million 
these letters of credit typically act as a guarantee of payment to certain third parties in accordance with specified terms and conditions 
the issuance of these letters of credit reduces our available capacity under the above mentioned facilities by the same amount 
in december  we issued million of convertible subordinated debentures due the debentures bore interest at per year and were convertible into our common stock  if the market price of the common stock exceeded a specified percentage of the conversion price per share of common stock 
holders had the option to require us to repurchase the debentures on specified anniversary dates from the issue date at of the principal amount plus accrued interest to the repurchase date 
we had the option to satisfy such repurchases in either cash and or our common stock  provided that shares of common stock reached a certain fair market value 
the debentures were redeemable in whole or in part for cash at our option at any time on or after december  additionally  the debentures were subordinated in right of payment to all of our senior indebtedness were effectively subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries 
in december  we completed an exchange offer whereby approximately of our then outstanding million convertible subordinated debentures the old notes were exchanged for new debentures the new notes 
the new notes had substantially identical terms to the previously outstanding old notes 
as the holders of both the new notes and the old notes had the option to require us to repurchase the debentures on certain dates  beginning with december   we classified the debentures as a current liability at january  in accordance with the debenture agreement  on december   the debenture holders of the new notes exercised their option to require the company to repurchase the debentures 
we repurchased the new notes using cash and existing credit lines 
in addition  prior to january   we also repurchased the old notes using cash and existing credit lines 
in august  we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission for million of debt and equity securities 
the net proceeds from any issuance are expected to be used for general corporate purposes  including capital expenditures  the repayment or refinancing of debt and to meet working capital needs 
as of january   we have not issued any debt or equity securities under this registration statement  nor can any assurances be given that we will issue any debt or equity securities under this registration statement in the future 
our debt to capital ratio was at january  we believe that our existing sources of liquidity  including cash resources and cash provided by operating activities  supplemented as necessary with funds available under our credit arrangements  will provide sufficient resources to meet our present and future working capital and cash requirements for at least the next months 
changes in our credit rating or other market factors may increase our interest expense or other costs of capital  or capital may not be available to us on acceptable terms to fund our working capital needs 
the company will continue to need additional financing  including debt financing 
the inability to obtain such sources of capital could have an adverse effect on the company s business 
the company s credit facilities contain various financial and other covenants that may limit the company s ability to borrow or limit the company s flexibility in responding to business conditions 

table of contents contractual obligations principal maturities of long term debt  comprised exclusively of capital leases  at january  and amounts due under future minimum lease payments  including minimum commitments under it outsourcing agreements  are as follow in thousands operating leases capital leases total fiscal year thereafter total payments less amounts representing interest total principal payments fair value renewal and purchase options and escalation clauses exist for a substantial portion of the operating leases included above 
purchase orders for the purchase of inventory and other goods and services are not included in the table above 
we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations  as purchase orders typically represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
for the purposes of this table  contractual obligations for purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on tech data and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
our purchase orders are based on our current demand expectations and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons 
we do not have significant non cancelable agreements for the purchase of inventory or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for the next three months 
we also enter into contracts for outsourced services  however  the obligations under these contracts were not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty 
off balance sheet arrangements synthetic lease facility on july   we completed a restructuring of our synthetic lease facility with a group of financial institutions the restructured lease under which we lease certain logistics centers and office facilities from a third party lessor 
the restructured lease expires in fiscal  at which time we have the following options renew the lease for an additional five years  purchase the properties at an amount equal to their cost  or remarket the properties 
if we elect to remarket the properties  we have guaranteed the lessor a percentage of the cost of each of the properties  in an aggregate amount of approximately million the residual value 
at any time during the lease term  we may  at our option  purchase up to four of the seven properties  at an amount equal to each property s cost 
we pay interest on the restructured lease at libor plus an agreed upon margin 
the restructured lease contains covenants that must be complied with on a continuous basis  similar to the covenants described in certain of the credit facilities discussed above and in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the amount funded under the restructured lease approximately million at january  is treated as debt under the definition of the covenants required under both the restructured lease and the credit facilities 
as of january   we were in compliance with all such covenants 
the sum of future minimum lease payments under the restructured lease at january  was approximately million 
properties leased under the restructured lease facility total million square feet of space  with land totaling acres located in clearwater and miami  florida  fort worth  texas  fontana  california  suwanee  georgia  swedesboro  new jersey  and south bend  indiana 
the restructured lease has been accounted for as an operating lease 
fasb interpretation fin no 
requires us to evaluate whether an entity with which we are involved meets the criteria of a variable interest entity vie and  if so  whether we are required to consolidate that entity 
we have determined that the third party lessor of this synthetic lease facility does not meet the criteria of a vie and  therefore  is not subject to the consolidation provisions of fin no 

table of contents trade receivables purchase facility agreements during fiscal  we entered into revolving trade receivables purchase facility agreements the receivables facilities with third party financial institutions to sell accounts receivable on a non recourse basis 
we use the receivables facilities as a source of working capital funding 
the receivables facilities limit the amount of purchased accounts receivable the financial institutions may hold to million at january   based on the foreign currency exchange rate at that date 
under the receivables facilities  we may sell certain accounts receivable the receivables in exchange for cash less a discount based on libor plus a margin 
such transactions have been accounted for as a true sale  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities 
the receivables facilities  of which million expires in may and million does not have an expiration date  require that we continue to service  administer and collect the sold accounts receivable 
during the year ended january   we received gross proceeds of million from the sale of the receivables and recognized related discounts totaling million 
the proceeds  net of the discount incurred  are reflected in the consolidated statement of cash flows in operating activities within cash received from customers and the change in accounts receivable 
guarantees as is customary in the it industry  to encourage certain customers to purchase product from us  we have arrangements with certain finance companies that provide inventory financing facilities for our customers 
in conjunction with certain of these arrangements  we have agreements with the finance companies that would require us to repurchase certain inventory  which might be repossessed from the customers by the finance companies 
due to various reasons  including among other items  the lack of information regarding the amount of saleable inventory purchased from us still on hand with the customer at any point in time  our repurchase obligations relating to inventory cannot be reasonably estimated 
repurchases of inventory by us under these arrangements have been insignificant to date 
we also provide additional financial guarantees to finance companies on behalf of certain customers 
the majority of these guarantees are for an indefinite period of time  where we would be required to perform if the customer is in default with the finance company 
the company reviews the underlying credit for these guarantees on at least an annual basis 
as of january  and  the aggregate amount of guarantees under these arrangements totaled approximately million and million  respectively  of which approximately million and million  respectively  was outstanding 
we believe that  based on historical experience  the likelihood of a material loss pursuant to both of the above guarantees is remote 
we also provide residual value guarantees related to our restructured lease which have been recorded at the estimated fair value of the residual value guarantees 
asset management we manage our inventories by maintaining sufficient quantities to achieve high order fill rates while attempting to stock only those products in high demand with a rapid turnover rate 
inventory balances fluctuate as we add new product lines and when appropriate  we make large purchases  including cash purchases from manufacturers and publishers when the terms of such purchases are considered advantageous 
our contracts with most of our vendors provide price protection and stock rotation privileges to reduce the risk of loss due to manufacturer price reductions and slow moving or obsolete inventory 
in the event of a vendor price reduction  we generally receive a credit for the impact on products in inventory and we have the right to rotate a certain percentage of purchases  subject to certain limitations 
historically  price protection and stock rotation privileges as well as our inventory management procedures have helped to reduce the risk of loss of inventory value 
we attempt to control losses on credit sales by closely monitoring customers creditworthiness through our it systems  which contain detailed information on each customer s payment history and other relevant information 
we have obtained credit insurance that insures a percentage of the credit extended by us to certain customers against possible loss 
customers who qualify for credit terms are typically granted net day payment terms in the americas 
while credit terms in emea vary by country  the vast majority of customers are granted credit terms ranging from days 
we also sell products on a prepay  credit card and cash on delivery basis 
in addition  certain of the company s vendors subsidize floorplan financing arrangements for the benefit of our customers 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk as a large global organization  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material impact on our financial results in the future 
in the normal course of business  we employ established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies using a variety of financial instruments 
it is our policy to utilize financial instruments to reduce risks where internal netting cannot be effectively employed 
additionally  we do not enter into foreign currency derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
our primary exposure relates to transactions in emea  where the currency collected from customers can be different from the currency used to purchase the product 
our foreign currency risk management objective is to protect our earnings and cash flows from the adverse impact of exchange rate changes 

table of contents foreign exchange risk is managed by using foreign currency forward  option and swap contracts to hedge both intercompany and third party a loans  b accounts receivable and c accounts payable 
we have elected not to designate our foreign currency contracts as hedging instruments  and they are therefore marked to market with changes in their value recorded in the income statement each period 
the underlying exposures are denominated primarily in the following currencies us dollar  british pound  canadian dollar  czech koruna  danish krone  euros  norwegian krone  polish zloty  swedish krona and swiss franc

interest rate risk is also present in the forward foreign currency contracts hedging intercompany and third party loans 
our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to minimize overall borrowing costs 
to achieve our objective  we use a combination of fixed and variable rate debt 
the nature and amount of our long term and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements  market conditions and other factors 
as of january  and  approximately and  respectively  of the outstanding debt had fixed interest rates 
we utilize various financing instruments  such as receivables securitization  leases  revolving credit facilities and trade receivable purchase facilities  to finance working capital needs
