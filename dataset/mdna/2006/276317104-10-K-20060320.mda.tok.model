critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap requires management to make judgments  estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
areas of uncertainty that require judgments  estimates and assumptions include items such as the accounting for derivatives  environmental matters  the testing of goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment  proceeds on assets to be sold  pensions and other postretirement benefits  and tax matters 
management uses historical experience and all available information to make its estimates and assumptions  but actual results will inevitably differ from the estimates and assumptions that are used to prepare the company s financial statements at any given time 
despite these inherent limitations  management believes that management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the financial statements and related footnotes provide a meaningful and fair presentation of the company 
management believes that the application of these estimates and assumptions on a consistent basis enables the company to provide the users of the financial statements with useful and reliable information about the company s operating results and financial condition 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the company reviews the collectibility of its receivables on an ongoing basis taking into account a combination of factors 
the company reviews potential problems  such as past due accounts  a bankruptcy filing or deterioration in the customer s financial condition  to ensure the company is adequately accrued for potential loss 
accounts are considered past due based on when payment was originally due 
if a customer s situation changes  such as a bankruptcy or creditworthiness  or there is a change in the current economic climate  the company may modify its estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company will write off accounts receivable after reasonable collection efforts have been made and the accounts are deemed uncollectible 
inventory reserve inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined by the last in  first out lifo method at the company s us facilities 
accordingly  a lifo valuation reserve is calculated using the dollar value link chain method 
we review the net realizable value of inventory in detail on an ongoing basis  giving consideration to deterioration  obsolescence and other factors 
based on these assessments  we provide for an inventory reserve in the period in which an impairment is identified 
the reserve fluctuates with market conditions  design cycles and other economic factors 
goodwill and other intangible assets intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized generally on a straight line basis over the periods benefited 
goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized 
each year during the second quarter  the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives is tested for impairment 
the company uses the discounted cash flow method to calculate the fair value of goodwill associated with its reporting units  no impairments of goodwill were deemed to exist 
the determination of discounted cash flows is based on the businesses strategic plans and long range planning forecasts 
the revenue growth rates included in the plans are management s best estimates based on current and forecasted market conditions  profit margin assumptions are projected by each business based on the current cost structures and anticipated cost reductions 
there can be no assurance that operations will achieve the future cash flows reflected in the projections 
if different assumptions were used in these plans  the related discounted cash flows used in measuring impairment could be different and an impairment of assets might need to be recorded 
pension and other postretirement benefits the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements related to pension and other postretirement benefits are determined from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are assumptions about such factors as expected return on plan assets  discount rates at which liabilities could be settled  rate of increase in future compensation levels  mortality rates and trends in health insurance costs 
these assumptions are reviewed annually and updated as required 
in accordance with us gaap  actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  affect the expense recognized and obligations recorded in future periods 
the discount rate used is based on comparisons to the moody s aa and aaa bond index  as well as a hypothetical yield curve that creates a reference portfolio of high quality corporate bonds whose payments mimic the plan s benefit payment stream 
the expected long term rate of return on assets is developed with input from the company s actuarial firms 
also considered is the company s historical experience with pension fund asset performance in comparison with expected returns 
the long term rate of return assumption used for determining net periodic pension expense for was 
the company reviews the long term rate of return each year 
future actual pension income and expense will depend on future investment performance  changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the population of participants in the company s pension plans 
the company expects to make cash contributions to its pension plans of approximately million for results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal the following table shows  for and  selected line items from the consolidated statements of income as a percentage of net sales  by segment

sales volume of existing products was up in all but two of the markets we service truck accessories and van bodies 
sales volume increased for sleeper boxes for the class trailer truck market  a product resulting from the canadian commercial vehicles acquisition in sales at the company s mexican subsidiary increased from primarily due to economic growth in mexico 
price increases generally offset higher raw material and production costs and did not result in an increase in gross margins

metal products segment net sales in the metal products segment were down from to sales of mine products were comparable for both years 
although sales of contract casting products declined in  shipments of ductile iron castings more than doubled from tons in to tons in in  the company added a salesman in canada to focus on the canadian mining business which we expect to result in increased business in we are also expanding our marketing efforts for our mine roof anchor products into australia and china 
late in the second quarter of  we completed our testing at a technology and authentication meeting in changzhi  china which was sponsored by the china university of mining and technology 
the china mining association approved our products for use in the china mining industry  stating that our products represented superior technology 
the company will continue to market the mine roof support anchors in the china mining industry 
cost of products sold increased as a percentage of net sales mainly due to the fixed costs associated with the metal products segment 
while costs related to volume declined  such as payroll and payroll related charges  supplies and tools and maintenance and repairs  increases were experienced in insurance costs and utilities 
rates for both natural gas and electricity increased and  respectively 
the division also was negatively impacted by the higher labor cost of manually pouring ductile iron 
as part of the company s longer term strategy of reducing the dependence on only pouring malleable iron  the company has determined that it can also produce quality ductile iron castings 
in order to improve the efficiency of producing ductile iron castings  the company will be installing a new automatic pouring system designed specifically for ductile iron during the first half of gross margin in the metal products segment decreased as a percentage of net sales mainly due to lower sales volume  producing ductile iron castings and a change in product mix 
selling and administrative expenses in the metal products segment increased from to  primarily due to the addition of sales personnel in canada and increased travel expenses associated with testing and marketing mine roof anchors in china

the industrial hardware segment experienced a increase in sales 
the increase in volume of existing products occurred in almost every market we service  most notably sales of industrial hardware such as rotary locks  locking recessed handles  multi point paddle handles and slam latches to original equipment manufacturers up and sales to distributors up 
these markets experienced rapid growth throughout as the economy improved 
sales of automotive accessories toolbox locks  push button locks and rotary latches declined as a result of domestic and offshore competition in this market 
sales at the company s mexican operation increased from primarily due to improved economic growth in mexico 
sales of sleeper boxes for the class trailer truck market  a product resulting from the canadian commercial vehicles acquisition  increased by 
new product introductions increased total segment sales by 
all of the new products were internally developed  and were aimed at the utility truck and vehicular accessory markets 
among the new products were power uptm  a remote power locking system  as well as various handles and latching systems 
the company continued to invest in new products and its new shanghai facility  and to search for business acquisitions that complement its existing operations or provide opportunities to enter new markets 
gross margin for the industrial hardware segment was of sales for as compared to for the improvement in the gross margin percentage resulted from the sale of higher margin products 
gross profit increased million  or  from due to higher sales volume and higher gross margin percentage 
in the security products segment  sales were higher than in the increase in volume of existing products was the result of sales of high security locks for access doors  electronics equipment and vehicular applications  which were up from levels  mainly through taking market share from our competition 
however  some of the sales increases were offset by slight declines in the sales of locks to the furniture  coin operated vending and gaming equipment markets and to lock distributors servicing lower volume accounts 
sales to the industrial controls and accessories market decreased 
sales of luggage locks for the travel industry increased in  following the introduction of our searchalerttm travel lock in late sales to this market had been hard hit in the wake of the september   terrorist attacks 
sales were additionally impacted by a transportation security administration tsa declaration that passengers should not lock their checked baggage on commercial airline flights 
responding to the tsa declaration  the ccl security products division introduced the searchalerttm  a new lock which meets all the requirements established by travel sentrytm  the standard setting group created to work closely with the tsa and the luggage lock manufacturers 
searchalerttm allows the tsa to unlock and inspect an airline passenger s bags without destroying the lock 
the product also lets the bags owner know  via an access indicator  if the bag has been opened 
sales of security products to the commercial laundry industry decreased from sales to this industry were down in most of our product lines and in all of the markets we service 
we continued our r d efforts and our search for smart card applications beyond the commercial laundry market 
we believe that the security characteristics of smart cards present us with several potential opportunities in new markets 
new product introductions increased total segment sales by 
the new products included the searchalerttm  a snap in lock and a toolbox push button lock 
the security products segment gross margin was for both and gross profit increased  or  from  primarily due to the increase in sales 
in the metal products segment  sales were down from the previous year 
sales of contract castings were down from the primary cause of the decrease in contract castings was the decision of two large accounts to move their remaining casting business to lower cost  offshore sources 
sales of mine roof support anchors decreased from  mainly because one account chose to place some key business with a lower cost  offshore supplier 
the bulk of the reduction in sales involved the proprietary product that we had produced under contract for that customer until mid the loss of this business was partially offset by a increase in sales to our second largest us mining account 
with rising oil prices  coal has been growing in importance as an energy source worldwide 
the growth in coal consumption should provide new opportunities for mine roof anchor sales both in north america and asia 
to expand our markets and counter the lower demand in the us for mine roof fasteners  resulting from changes in mining methods utilizing fewer roof anchors per ton of coal produced  during we entered into a technical agreement with the china university of mining and technology for the field testing and eventual marketing of the company s mechanical anchor systems  which are used to secure the roofs in underground mines 
these tests have been substantially and successfully completed 
in addition  to offset reduced demand for malleable iron castings  we have continued to develop our ductile iron casting capability 
shipments of ductile iron castings grew to tons in gross margin for the metal products segment was for as compared to for gross profit for decreased  or  from  primarily due to lower sales volume and the fixed costs associated with the business 
the company wide gross margin percentage for was points higher than in versus 
gross profit increased million  or  from the increase was due to more efficient utilization of manufacturing facilities resulting from higher sales volume  increased sales of higher margin products  and lower group health insurance premiums resulting from the consolidation of several health plans in early total selling and administrative expenses increased  or million  from the increase was due to higher wage expense and associated payroll charges  higher legal costs and the cost of a mediated settlement associated with the defense of a patent lawsuit which the company determined to be without merit  and costs associated with the establishment of the shanghai facility

the metal products segment recorded a operating loss of  or of sales  as compared to a loss of  or  in the erosion in operating profit was primarily the result of fixed costs relating to the operation of the foundry and the reduction in sales 
interest expense for the company decreased  or  from due to lower outstanding debt balances 
other income decreased  or  from the decrease primarily reflected a gain in on the sale of common stock  and a drop in the interest income the company received during the gain in totaled  and was from the sale of common stock received during from a single issuer in connection with the issuer s demutualization 
the decrease in interest income of  was due to lower cash balances in the company cash management program 
the effective tax rate in was  down from in the decrease was primarily due to a change in the mix of taxable earnings in foreign jurisdictions with lower effective tax rates 
liquidity and sources of capital the company s financial position remained strong throughout the primary source of the company s cash is earnings from operating activities adjusted for cash generated from or used in net working capital 
the most significant recurring non cash items included in income are depreciation and amortization expense 
changes in working capital fluctuate with the changes in operating activities 
as sales increase  there generally is an increased requirement for working capital 
since increases in working capital reduce the company s cash  management attempts to keep the company s investment in net working capital at a reasonable level by closely monitoring inventory levels by matching production to expected market demand  keeping tight control over the collection of receivables  and optimizing payment terms on its trade and other payables 
the company is dependent on the continued demand for its products and subsequent collection of accounts receivable from its customers 
the company serves a broad base of customers and industries with a variety of products 
as a result  any fluctuations in demand or payment from a particular industry or customer will not have a material impact on the company s sales and collection of receivables 
management expects that the company s foreseeable cash needs for operations  capital expenditures  debt service and dividend payments will continue to be met by the company s operating cash flows and existing credit facility

on august   the company amended its loan agreement with its lender 
the amendment renewed and extended the maturity of the revolving credit loan from july  to august  and restructured and increased the existing balance of the term loan into a new five year loan 
quarterly payments under the amended term loan are  beginning in  where they will remain through the middle of a final payment of  is due july  the additional million proceeds from the term loan were used to pay down the balance on the revolving credit loan 
on august   the company entered into an interest rate swap contract with its lender with an original notional amount of  notional amount  on december   which was equal to of the outstanding balance of the term loan on that date 
the notional amount decreases on a quarterly basis following the principal repayment schedule of the term portion of the loan agreement 
the company has a fixed interest rate of on the swap contract and will pay the difference between the fixed rate and libor when libor is below and will receive interest when the libor rate exceeds 
previously  the company maintained an interest rate swap contract with the lender with an original amount of million  this amount was reduced on a quarterly basis in accordance with the principal repayment schedule of the term portion of the loan agreement million on january   and million on january  
under the revolving credit portion of the loan agreement  the company may borrow up to million through august   and must pay a quarterly commitment fee of on the unused portion 
as of december   there was no balance outstanding under the revolver portion of the loan agreement 
the company s loan covenants restrict it from incurring any indebtedness from any person other than the lender that exceeds the aggregate sum of million  or that exceeds million in any single transaction  without the express consent of the lender or until the full payment of the current obligation has been made

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s foreign manufacturing facilities account for approximately of total sales and of total assets 
its us operations buy from and sell to these foreign affiliates  and also make limited sales approximately of total sales to nonaffiliated foreign customers 
this trade activity could be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange or by weak economic conditions 
the company s currency exposure is concentrated in the canadian dollar  mexican peso  new taiwan dollar  chinese rmb and hong kong dollar 
because of the company s limited exposure to any single foreign market  any exchange gains or losses have not been material and are not expected to be material in the future 
had the exchange rate as of december  for all of the listed currencies changed by  the total change in reported earnings would have been less than  as a result  the company does not attempt to mitigate its foreign currency exposure through the acquisition of any speculative or leveraged financial instruments 
in  a increase decrease in exchange rates would have resulted in a translation increase decrease to sales of approximately million  and to equity of approximately million 
the company is exposed to interest rate risk with respect to its unsecured loan agreement  which provides for interest based on libor plus a spread of up to 
the spread is determined by a comparison of the company s operating performance with agreed upon financial targets 
since the company s performance depends to a large extent on the overall economy  the interest rate paid by the company under its loan agreement is closely linked to the trend in the us economy 
the current interest rate spread is on the term loan portion and on the revolving credit line portion of the loan agreement 
changes in libor rates will also affect the company s interest expense 
to hedge against future libor rate increases  the company has an interest rate swap contract on of the term loan principal amount under the loan agreement 
the interest rate on the swap contract is and the swap contract expires on july  the notional amount of the swap contract is reduced on a quarterly basis in accordance with the principal repayment schedule for the term portion of the loan agreement 
the notional amount of the swap contract was million as of december  the remainder of the term debt is subject to the volatility of short term interest rates  where a change in interest rates would cause a  increase or decrease in the company s annual interest cost 
while the company could enter into an additional swap agreement to fix the rate  it does not expect to do so
