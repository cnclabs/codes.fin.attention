we have the exclusive right to manufacture  sell and distribute pepsi cola beverages in all or a portion of the us  mexico  canada and europe  which consists of operations in spain  greece  russia and turkey 
as shown in the graph below  the us business is the dominant driver of our results  generating of our volume  of our revenues and of our operating income 
bar chart pbg is the world s largest manufacturer  seller and distributor of pepsi cola beverages 
the beverages sold by us include pepsi cola  diet pepsi  mountain dew  aquafina  lipton brisk  sierra mist  diet mountain dew  tropicana juice drinks  sobe and starbucks frappuccino 
in addition to the foregoing  the beverages we sell outside the us include up  kas  aqua minerale  mirinda and manzanita sol 
in some of our territories  we have the right to manufacture  sell and distribute soft drink products of companies other than pepsico  inc pepsico  including dr pepper and squirt 
we also have the right in some of our territories to manufacture  sell and distribute beverages under trademarks that we own  including electropura  epura and garci crespo 
our products are sold in either a cold drink or take home format 
our cold drink format consists of cold products sold in the retail and foodservice channels  which carry the highest profit margins on a per case basis 
our take home format consists of unchilled products that are sold for at home future consumption 
physical cases represent the number of units that are actually produced  distributed and sold 
each case of product as sold to our customers  regardless of package configuration  represents one physical case 
our net price and gross margin on a per case basis are impacted by how much we charge for the product  the mix of brands and packages we sell  and the channels in which the product is sold 
for example  we realize a higher net revenue and gross margin per case on a ounce chilled bottle sold in a convenience store than on a two liter unchilled bottle sold in a grocery store 
our financial success is dependent on a number of factors  including our strong partnership with pepsico  the customer relationships we cultivate  the pricing we achieve in the marketplace  our market execution  our ability to meet changing consumer preferences and the efficiency we achieve in manufacturing and distributing our products 
key indicators of our financial success are measured by the number of physical cases we sell  the net price and gross margin we achieve on a per case basis  and our overall cost productivity  reflecting how well we manage our raw material  manufacturing  distribution and other overhead costs

the discussion and analysis throughout management s financial review should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related accompanying notes 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements and the related accompanying notes  including various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits  taxes  environmental and other matters arising out of the normal course of business

the lawsuit related to purchases of high fructose corn syrup by several companies  including bottling entities owned and operated by pepsico  during the period from july  to june  the claims period 
certain of the bottling entities owned by pepsico during the claims period were transferred to pbg when pepsico formed pbg in with respect to these entities  which we currently operate  we received million in hfcs settlement proceeds 
we received an additional million in hfcs settlement proceeds related to bottling operations not previously owned by pepsico  such as manufacturing co operatives of which we are a member 
rd week our fiscal year ends on the last saturday in december and  as a result  a rd week is added every five or six years 
fiscal year consisted of weeks while fiscal years and consisted of weeks 
our results included pre tax income of approximately million due to the rd week 
strategic spending initiatives we reinvested both the pre tax gain of million from the hfcs settlement and the pre tax income of million from the rd week in long term strategic spending initiatives in the us  canada and europe 
the strategic spending initiatives included programs designed primarily to enhance our customer service agenda  drive productivity and improve our management information systems 
these strategic spending initiatives were recorded in selling  delivery and administrative expenses 
non gaap measurements and adjusted results we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap 
in an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding the company s results we have included in this document certain non gaap measures as defined by the securities and exchange commission 
specifically  we have presented non gaap measures to supplement our financial performance summary and our outlook 
we have excluded the impact of the hfcs settlement  the rd week and the strategic spending initiatives from our results and from certain items in our outlook as we consider these items as unusual and outside of the ordinary course of our business 
management believes these non gaap financial measures provide useful information to investors regarding the underlying business performance of the company s ongoing results and should be considered in addition to  not in lieu of  us gaap reported measures 
non gaap measures used in this document are referred to as adjusted

table of contents financial performance summary in millions  except per share data december december fiscal year   change net revenues gross profit operating income net income diluted earnings per share during  we delivered strong results  reflecting robust topline growth which was partially offset by higher raw material costs and selling  delivery and administrative expenses 
overall  we grew our worldwide operating income by five percent  which includes a one percentage point benefit from the net impact of the rd week  the gain from the hfcs settlement and spending initiatives 
these results were driven by operating income growth in the us of six percent  of which two percentage points were driven by the unusual items discussed above  coupled with double digit increases in mexico and canada 
this growth was partially offset by a double digit operating income decrease in europe  driven by declines in spain 
our operating income growth in mexico  which includes the lapping of a million impairment charge in  was below our expectations due mostly to lower than anticipated cost savings in our selling  delivery and administrative expenses 
our strong worldwide topline growth was driven by innovation  including new products  pricing improvements and strong execution in the marketplace as well as the impact of the rd week 
growth was driven primarily by an approximate three percent increase in volume and a three percent increase in net revenue per case 
the impact of the rd week  the effect of foreign currency translation and acquisitions each contributed a percentage point to our topline growth 
in the us  we achieved a five percent volume increase  which includes three percentage points of growth due to the rd week and acquisitions 
the balance of the growth was due primarily to volume increases in both large format stores and our foodservice business which consists of restaurants and workplaces 
these volume increases were driven by a three percent increase in our take home channel and a two percent increase in our cold drink channel 
our portfolio growth was in line with consumer trends  with most of the volume increase coming from our water  non carbonated and diet portfolios 
in the us  net revenue per case increased three percent  driven primarily by rate increases 
in canada  topline growth of percent was driven primarily by the favorable impact of foreign currency translation  coupled with a net revenue per case increase of three percent and volume improvements of two percent  as well as the rd week 
volume and pricing growth was fueled by strong execution and strategic marketing programs that were designed to gain consumer interest 
in europe  we delivered strong topline results  growing net revenues by percent versus the prior year  driven by double digit volume growth in russia and turkey 
our mexico topline growth of percent was driven primarily by volume growth of five percent and the favorable impact of foreign currency translation 
our volume growth in mexico was fueled by double digit increases in both our bottled water and jug businesses  partially offset by slight declines in our carbonated soft drink business 

table of contents our strong worldwide topline growth was partially offset by increases in cost of sales  which have continued to pressure our bottom line results 
on a per case basis  cost of sales increased five percent  reflecting significant increases in raw material costs 
during  we continued to see increases in resin prices  exacerbated by a severe hurricane season in the us these increases added approximately million of costs or approximately two percentage points of growth to our worldwide cost of sales per case 
additionally  the negative impact of foreign currency translation contributed one percentage point of growth to our cost of sales per case increase 
worldwide selling  delivery and administrative expenses increased eight percent 
increases in selling  delivery and administrative costs were driven by higher volume growth  wage and benefit increases and rising fuel prices 
additionally  the strategic spending initiatives and the additional expenses from the rd week  partially offset by the gain from the settlement of the hfcs class action lawsuit  added approximately one percentage point of growth to our overall selling  delivery and administrative expenses 
the strategic spending initiatives included programs to implement our new customer service program  drive productivity and improve our management information systems 
interest expense  net increased by million due to the impact of rising interest rates on approximately percent of our debt that is variable  coupled with the impact of the rd week 
the company s cash flow from operations continued to be strong in we generated billion of cash from operations  after contributing million into our pension plans  which are adequately funded 
with our strong cash flows  we utilized million for capital investments to grow our business and returned million to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends during the year 
during  we increased our annual dividend by percent  raising it from to per share 
outlook in  our fiscal year will consist of weeks  while fiscal year consisted of weeks 
our us and canadian operations report on a fiscal year that consists of weeks  ending on the last saturday in december 
every five or six years a rd week is added 
our other countries report on a calendar year basis 
our results included the impact of the rd week 
in order to provide comparable guidance for  we have excluded the impact of the rd week from our volume outlook  as described in the table below 
as discussed in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  the company will adopt statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r in the first quarter of sfas r will require that all stock based payments be expensed based on the fair value of the awards 
in accordance with existing accounting guidelines  the company did not recognize compensation expense for stock options during fiscal year therefore  management believes that providing an adjusted measure that excludes the impact of sfas r from the outlook provides a meaningful year over year comparison of sd a  operating income change and diluted earnings per share

in  we will carefully balance our net revenue per case  using rate increases where marketplace conditions allow  while also managing the mix of products we plan to sell 
we expect to increase both our worldwide and us net revenue per case two to three percent  driven primarily by rate improvements  coupled with a mix shift into higher priced products 
in  worldwide cost of sales per case is expected to increase by approximately three percent 
we are expecting the rate of growth of our raw material costs  particularly resin and sweeteners  to moderate during nonetheless we anticipate that our raw material costs  including aluminum  resin and sweeteners will increase in the low single digits in as a result  we expect our gross margin per case to grow about two percent 
our selling  delivery and administrative expenses are expected to rise approximately four to five percent  including increases in fuel cost and higher pension expense  each contributing approximately million of additional expense 
the impact of adopting sfas r will add approximately million to our overall sd a and result in a seven percentage point reduction in our operating income 
accordingly  we expect our operating income to be down two to four percent for the year 
in  we expect interest expense to increase to approximately million  reflecting the impact of rising interest rates on approximately percent of our debt that is variable  coupled with increased interest associated with anticipated debt financings in from a cash flow perspective  we expect to generate net cash provided by operations of over billion and we plan to spend approximately million in capital investments 
net cash provided by operations less capital expenditures is expected to be to million in our cash flows from operations in are expected to increase versus due to lower pension contributions and a greater mix of non cash charges in 
table of contents critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap often requires us to make judgments  estimates  and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the results of operations  financial position and cash flows of the company  as well as the related footnote disclosures 
management bases its estimates on knowledge of our operations  markets in which we operate  historical trends  and other assumptions 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
significant accounting policies are discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
our critical accounting policies are those policies which management believes are most important to the portrayal of pbg s financial condition and results of operations and require the use of estimates  assumptions and the application of judgment 
management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit and affiliated transactions committee of our board of directors 
allowance for doubtful accounts a portion of our accounts receivable will not be collected due to bankruptcies and sales returns 
estimating an allowance for doubtful accounts requires significant management judgment and assumptions regarding the potential for losses on receivable balances 
our accounting policy for the provision for doubtful accounts requires reserving an amount based on the evaluation of the aging of accounts receivable  sales return trend analysis  detailed analysis of high risk customer accounts  and the overall market and economic conditions of our customers 
accordingly  we estimate the amounts necessary to provide for losses on receivables by using quantitative measures  evaluating specific customer accounts for risk of loss  and adjusting for changes in economic conditions in which we and our customers operate 
we manage the risk of losses on accounts receivable by having effective credit controls and by evaluating our receivables on an ongoing basis 
our allowance for doubtful accounts represents management s best estimate of probable losses inherent in our portfolio 
if a general economic downturn occurs causing the financial condition of our customers to deteriorate or if one of our customers has an unforeseen inability to pay us  the allowance for doubtful accounts and bad debt expense would be increased from our estimate 
the following is an analysis of the allowance for doubtful accounts for the fiscal years ended december   december  and december  allowance for doubtful accounts beginning of the year bad debt expense accounts written off foreign currency translation end of the year recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized  but instead tested annually for impairment 
our identified intangible assets principally arise from the allocation of the purchase price of businesses acquired  and consist primarily of franchise rights  distribution rights and brands 
we assign amounts to such identified intangibles based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
the determination of the expected life will be dependent upon the use and underlying characteristics of the identified intangible asset 
in determining whether our intangible assets have an indefinite useful life  we consider the following as applicable the nature and terms of underlying agreements  our intent and ability to use the specific asset contained in an agreement  the age and market position of the products within the territories we are entitled to sell  the historical and projected growth of those products  and costs  if any  to renew the agreement 
we evaluate our identified intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment annually unless it is required more frequently because of a triggering event 
we measure impairment as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value 

table of contents the fair value of our franchise rights and distribution rights is measured using a multi period excess earnings method that is based upon estimated discounted future cash flows 
we deduct a contributory charge from our net after tax cash flows for the economic return attributable to our working capital  other intangible assets and property  plant and equipment  which represents the required cash flow to support these assets 
the net discounted cash flows in excess of the fair returns on these assets represent the estimated fair value of our franchise rights and distribution rights 
the fair value of our brands is measured using a multi period royalty savings method  which reflects the savings realized by owning the brand and  therefore  not having to pay a royalty fee to a third party 
in valuing our brands  we have selected an estimated industry royalty rate relating to each brand and then applied it to the forecasted revenues associated with each brand 
the net discounted after tax cash flows from these royalty charges represent the fair value of our brands 
our discount rate utilized in each fair value calculation is based upon our weighted average cost of capital plus an additional risk premium to reflect the risk and uncertainty inherent in separately acquiring the identified intangible asset between a willing buyer and a willing seller 
the additional risk premium associated with our discount rate effectively eliminates the benefit that we believe results from synergies  scale and our assembled workforce  all of which are components of goodwill 
each year we re evaluate our assumptions in our discounted cash flow model to address changes in our business and marketplace conditions 
we evaluate goodwill on a country by country basis reporting unit for impairment 
we evaluate each reporting unit for impairment based upon a two step approach 
first  we compare the fair value of our reporting unit with its carrying value 
second  if the carrying value of our reporting unit exceeds its fair value  we compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill to its carrying amount to measure the amount of impairment loss 
in measuring the implied fair value of goodwill  we would allocate the fair value of the reporting unit to each of its assets and liabilities including any unrecognized intangible assets 
any excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
we measure the fair value of a reporting unit as the discounted estimated future cash flows  including a terminal value  which assumes the business continues in perpetuity  less its respective minority interest and net debt net of cash and cash equivalents 
our long term terminal growth assumptions reflect our current long term view of the marketplace 
our discount rate is based upon our weighted average cost of capital for each reporting unit 
each year we re evaluate our assumptions in our discounted cash flow model to address changes in our business and marketplace conditions 
considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate discounted future cash flows in conducting an impairment test for goodwill and other identified intangible assets  which may be impacted by future actions taken by us and our competitors and the volatility in the markets in which we conduct business 
a change in assumptions in our cash flows could have a significant impact on the fair value of our reporting units and other identified intangible assets  which could then result in a material impairment charge to our results of operations 
for example  an inability to achieve strategic business plan targets in a reporting unit could result in an impairment charge of one or more specific intangible assets 
in mexico  we have recorded approximately billion of intangible assets 
mexico has not met our profit expectations  however  we have specific plans in place to improve our future results 
we will continue to closely monitor our performance in mexico and evaluate the realizability of each intangible asset 
pension and postretirement medical benefit plans we sponsor pension and other postretirement medical benefit plans in various forms  covering employees who meet specified eligibility requirements 
our us employees participate in noncontributory defined benefit pension plans  which cover substantially all full time salaried employees  as well as most hourly employees 
our net pension expense for the defined benefit plans for our operations outside the us was not significant  and accordingly assumptions and sensitivity analyses regarding these plans are not included in the discussion below 
assumptions and estimates are required to calculate the expenses and obligations for these plans including discount rate  expected return on plan assets  retirement age  mortality  turnover  health care cost trend rates and compensation rate increases 
we evaluate these assumptions with our actuarial advisors on an annual basis and we believe that they are appropriate 
our assumptions are based upon historical experience of the plan and expectations for the future 
these assumptions may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions 
an increase 
table of contents or decrease in the assumptions or economic events outside our control could have a material impact on reported net income and the related funding requirements 
key assumptions the assets  liabilities and assumptions used to measure pension and postretirement medical expense for any fiscal year are determined as of september th of the preceding year measurement date 
the discount rate assumption is derived from the present value of our expected pension and postretirement medical benefit payment streams 
the present value is calculated by utilizing a yield curve that matches the timing of our expected benefit payments 
the yield curve is developed by our actuarial advisers using a portfolio of several hundred high quality non callable corporate bonds 
the bonds are rated aa or better by moody s and have at least million in principal amount 
the bonds are denominated in us dollars and have maturity dates ranging from six months to thirty years 
once the present value of all the expected payment streams has been calculated  a single discount rate is determined 
the weighted average discount rate for fiscal year for our pension and postretirement medical plans is percent and percent  respectively 
in evaluating the expected rate of return on assets for a given fiscal year  we consider both projected future returns of asset classes and the actual to year historic returns on asset classes in our pension investment portfolio  reflecting the weighted average return of our asset allocation 
our target asset allocation for our domestic pension assets is percent equity investments  of which approximately percent is invested in domestic equities and percent is invested in foreign equities 
the remaining percent of our plan assets is invested primarily in fixed income securities  which is equally divided between us government and corporate bonds 
our current portfolio s target asset allocation for the and year periods had weighted average returns of percent and percent  respectively 
over time  the expected rate of return on pension plan assets should approximate the actual long term returns 
based on the historic and estimated future returns of our portfolio  we estimate the long term rate of return on assets for our domestic pension plans to be percent in pension and postretirement medical plans accounting differences between actual and expected returns on plan assets are recognized in the net periodic pension calculation over five years 
to the extent the amount of all unrecognized gains and losses exceeds percent of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets  such amount is amortized over the average remaining service period of active participants 
net unrecognized losses  within our pension and postretirement plans totaled million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the following table provides our current and expected weighted average assumptions for our pension and postretirement medical plans expense in the united states pension discount rate expected return on plan assets net of administrative expenses rate of compensation increase postretirement discount rate rate of compensation increase health care cost trend rate during  our company sponsored defined benefit pension and postretirement medical plan expenses in the us totaled million  including a special termination benefit charge of million for a voluntary early retirement enhancement program 
in  our ongoing pension and postretirement medical plan expenses  excluding the special termination benefit charge  were million 
in  our ongoing expenses will increase by approximately million to million due primarily to the following factors a decrease in our weighted average discount rate for our pension and postretirement medical expense from percent and percent to percent and percent  respectively  reflecting declines in the 
table of contents yields of long term corporate bonds comprising the yield curve 
this change in assumption will increase our defined benefit pension and postretirement medical expense by approximately million 
certain benefit plan enhancements and demographic changes will increase our defined benefit pension and postretirement medical expense by approximately million 
sensitivity analysis it is unlikely that in any given year the actual rate of return will be the same as the assumed long term rate of return of percent 
the following table provides a summary of the last three years of actual returns versus the expected long term returns for our domestic pension plans expected return on plan assets net of administrative expenses actual return on plan assets net of administrative expenses sensitivity of changes in key assumptions for our principal pension and postretirement plans expense in are as follows discount rate a basis point change in the discount rate would increase or decrease the expense for our pension and postretirement medical benefit plans in by approximately million 
expected return on plan assets a basis point change in the expected return on plan assets would increase or decrease the expense for our pension plans in by approximately million 
the postretirement medical benefit plans have no expected return on plan assets as they are funded from the general assets of the company as the payments come due 
for further information about our pension and postretirement plans see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
casualty insurance costs due to the nature of our business  we require insurance coverage for certain casualty risks 
in the united states we are self insured for workers compensation and automobile risks for occurrences up to million  and product and general liability risks for occurrences up to million 
for losses exceeding these self insurance thresholds  we purchase casualty insurance from a third party provider 
our liability for casualty costs of million and million as of december  and december   respectively  is estimated using individual case based valuations and statistical analyses and is based upon historical experience  actuarial assumptions and professional judgment 
we do not discount our loss expense reserves 
these estimates are subject to the effects of trends in loss severity and frequency and are subject to a significant degree of inherent variability 
we evaluate these estimates with our actuarial advisors periodically during the year and we believe that they are appropriate  although an increase or decrease in the estimates or events outside our control could have a material impact on reported net income 
accordingly  the ultimate settlement of these costs may vary significantly from the estimates included in our financial statements 
income taxes our effective tax rate is based on pre tax income  statutory tax rates  tax regulations and tax planning strategies available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
the tax bases of our assets and liabilities reflect our best estimate of the tax benefits and costs we expect to realize 
we establish valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized 
a significant portion of deferred tax assets consists of net operating loss carryforwards nols 
we have nols totaling  million at december   which are available to reduce future taxes in the us  spain  greece  russia  turkey and mexico 
the majority of our nols are generated overseas  the largest of which is coming from our mexican and spanish operations 
of these nols  million expire in and  million expire at various times between and significant management judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax position 
we establish reserves when  based on the applicable tax law and facts and circumstances relating to a 
table of contents particular transaction or tax position  it becomes probable that the position will not be sustained when challenged by a taxing authority 
a change in our tax reserves could have a significant impact on our results of operations 
under our tax separation agreement with pepsico  pepsico maintains full control and absolute discretion for any combined or consolidated tax filings for tax periods ended on or before our initial public offering that occurred in march however  pepsico may not settle any issue without our written consent  which consent cannot be unreasonably withheld 
pepsico has contractually agreed to act in good faith with respect to all tax examination matters affecting us 
in accordance with the tax separation agreement  we will bear our allocable share of any risk or benefit resulting from the settlement of tax matters affecting us for these tax periods 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a tax contingency reserve is audited and finally resolved 
the number of years for which we have audits that are open varies depending on the tax jurisdiction 
the us internal revenue service irs is currently examining our and pepsico s joint tax returns for through march and our tax returns for the and tax years 
the irs audit of our and tax returns concluded in however  pursuant to an agreement with the irs  our and tax years remain open solely with respect to matters arising out of the irs examination of pepsico involving our initial public offering transaction on march  while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of the resolution  we believe that our tax reserves reflect the probable outcome of known tax contingencies 
favorable resolutions would be recognized as a reduction of our tax expense in the year of resolution 
unfavorable resolutions would be recognized as a reduction to our reserves  a cash outlay for settlement and a possible increase to our annual tax provision 
for further information about our income taxes see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
related party transactions pepsico is considered a related party due to the nature of our franchise relationship and its ownership interest in our company 
more than percent of our volume is derived from the sale of brands from pepsico 
at december   pepsico owned approximately percent of our outstanding common stock and percent of our outstanding class b common stock  together representing approximately percent of the voting power of all classes of our voting stock 
in addition  pepsico owns percent of the equity of bottling group  llc  our principal operating subsidiary 
we fully consolidate the results of bottling group  llc and present pepsico s share as minority interest in our consolidated financial statements

additionally  under a shared services agreement  we obtain various services from pepsico  which include services for information technology maintenance and the procurement of raw materials 
we also provide services to pepsico  including facility and credit and collection support 
we review our annual marketing  advertising  management and financial plans each year with pepsico for its approval 
if we fail to submit these plans  or if we fail to carry them out in all material respects  pepsico can terminate our beverage agreements 
because we depend on pepsico to provide us with concentrate  bottler incentives and various services  changes in our relationship with pepsico could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 

table of contents the consolidated statements of operations include the following income expense amounts as a result of transactions with pepsico and its affiliates net revenues bottler incentives a cost of sales purchases of concentrate and finished products  and aquafina royalty fees b bottler incentives a manufacturing and distribution service reimbursements c selling  delivery and administrative expenses bottler incentives a fountain service fee d frito lay purchases e shared services f shared services expense shared services revenue net shared services hfcs h income tax benefit g a bottler incentives and other arrangements in order to promote pepsico beverages  pepsico  at their sole discretion  provides us with various forms of bottler incentives 
these incentives cover a variety of initiatives  including direct marketplace support and advertising support 
we record most of these incentives as an adjustment to cost of sales unless the incentive is for reimbursement of a specific  incremental and identifiable cost 
under these conditions  the incentive would be recorded as an offset against the related costs  either in revenue or selling  delivery and administrative expenses 
changes in our bottler incentives and funding levels could materially affect our business and financial results 
b purchase of concentrate and finished product as part of our franchise relationship  we purchase concentrate from pepsico  pay royalties and produce or distribute other products through various arrangements with pepsico or pepsico joint ventures

acquisitions in september  we acquired the operations and exclusive right to manufacture  sell and distribute pepsi cola beverages from the pepsi cola bottling company of charlotte  north carolina 
the acquisition did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
as a result of the acquisition  we have assigned million to goodwill  million to franchise rights and million to non compete arrangements 
the goodwill and franchise rights are not subject to amortization 
the non compete agreements are being amortized over ten years 
the allocations of the purchase price for the acquisition are still preliminary and will be determined based on the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of the acquisition 
the operating results of the acquisition are included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements from its date of purchase 
the acquisition was made to enable us 
table of contents to provide better service to our large retail customers

during  we also paid million for the purchase of certain distribution rights relating to sobe 
we intend to continue to pursue other acquisitions of independent pepsico bottlers  particularly in territories contiguous to our own  where they create shareholder value 
market risks and cautionary statements quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  our financial position is routinely subject to a variety of risks 
these risks include the risk associated with the price of commodities purchased and used in our business  interest rates on outstanding debt and currency movements of non us dollar denominated assets and liabilities 
we are also subject to the risks associated with the business environment in which we operate  including the collectibility of accounts receivable 
we regularly assess all of these risks and have policies and procedures in place to protect against the adverse effects of these exposures 
our objective in managing our exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates is to minimize the volatility of earnings and cash flows associated with changes in the applicable rates and prices 
to achieve this objective  we have derivative instruments to hedge against the risk of adverse movements in commodity prices  interest rates and foreign currency 
our corporate policy prohibits the use of derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes  and we have procedures in place to monitor and control their use 
see note in notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information relating to our derivative instruments 
a sensitivity analysis has been prepared to determine the effects that market risk exposures may have on our financial instruments 
we performed the sensitivity analyses for hypothetical changes in commodity prices  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and changes in our stock price on our unfunded deferred compensation liability 
information provided by these sensitivity analyses does not necessarily represent the actual changes in fair value that we would incur under normal market conditions because  due to practical limitations  all variables other than the specific market risk factor were held constant 
as a result  the reported changes in the values of some financial instruments that are affected by the sensitivity analyses are not matched with the offsetting changes in the values of the items that those instruments are designed to finance or hedge 
commodity price risk we are subject to market risks with respect to commodities because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing may be limited by the competitive environment in which we operate 
we use futures contracts and options on futures in the normal course of business to hedge anticipated purchases of certain commodities used in our operations 
with respect to commodity price risk  we currently have various contracts outstanding for commodity purchases in and  which establish our purchase prices within defined ranges 
we estimate that a percent decrease in commodity prices with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of our financial instruments of million and million at december  and december   respectively 

table of contents interest rate risk interest rate risk is present with both fixed and floating rate debt 
we use interest rate swaps to manage our interest expense risk 
these instruments effectively change the interest rate of specific debt issuances 
as a result  changes in interest rates on our variable debt would change our interest expense 
we estimate that a basis point increase in interest rates on our variable rate debt and cash equivalents with all other variables held constant would have resulted in an increase to net interest expense of million in both and foreign currency exchange rate risk in  approximately percent of our net revenues came from outside the united states 
social  economic and political conditions in these international markets may adversely affect our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
the overall risks to our international businesses include changes in foreign governmental policies and other political or economic developments 
these developments may lead to new product pricing  tax or other policies and monetary fluctuations that may adversely impact our business 
in addition  our results of operations and the value of the foreign assets and liabilities are affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
as currency exchange rates change  translation of the statements of operations of our businesses outside the us into us dollars affects year over year comparability 
we generally have not hedged against these types of currency risks because cash flows from our international operations are usually reinvested locally 
we have foreign currency transactional risks in certain of our international territories for transactions that are denominated in currencies that are different from their functional currency 
we have entered into forward exchange contracts to hedge portions of our forecasted us dollar cash flows in our canadian business 
a percent weaker us dollar against the canadian dollar  with all other variables held constant  would result in a decrease in the fair value of these contracts of million and million at december  and december   respectively 
foreign currency gains and losses reflect both transaction gains and losses in our foreign operations  as well as translation gains and losses arising from the re measurement into us dollars of the net monetary assets of businesses in highly inflationary countries 
turkey is considered a highly inflationary economy for accounting purposes 
beginning in  turkey will no longer be considered highly inflationary  and will change its functional currency from the us dollar to the turkish lira 
we do not expect any material impact on our consolidated financial statements as a result of turkey s change in functional currency 
unfunded deferred compensation liability our unfunded deferred compensation liability is subject to changes in our stock price as well as price changes in certain other equity and fixed income investments 
employees participating in our deferred compensation program can elect to defer all or a portion of their compensation to be paid out on a future date or dates 
as part of the deferral process  employees select from phantom investment options that determine the earnings on the deferred compensation liability and the amount that they will ultimately receive 
employee investment elections include pbg stock and a variety of other equity and fixed income investment options 
since the plan is unfunded  employees deferred compensation amounts are not directly invested in these investment vehicles 
instead  we track the performance of each employee s investment selections and adjust his or her deferred compensation account accordingly 
the adjustments to the employees accounts increase or decrease the deferred compensation liability reflected on our consolidated balance sheets with an offsetting increase or decrease to our selling  delivery and administrative expenses 
we use prepaid forward contracts to hedge the portion of our deferred compensation liability that is based on our stock price 
therefore  changes in compensation expense as a result of changes in our stock price are substantially offset by the changes in the fair value of these contracts 
we estimate that a percent unfavorable change in the year end stock price would have reduced the fair value from these commitments by million in and

fiscal years and consisted of fifty two weeks 
our remaining countries report using a calendar year basis 
accordingly  we recognize our quarterly business results as outlined below quarter us canada mexico europe first quarter weeks january and february second quarter weeks march  april and may third quarter weeks june  july and august fourth quarter weeks weeks fy september  october  november and december revenue recognition revenue  net of sales returns  is recognized when our products are delivered or shipped to customers in accordance with the written sales terms 
we offer certain sales incentives on a local and national level through various customer trade agreements designed to enhance the growth of our revenue 
customer trade agreements are accounted for as a reduction to our revenues 
customer trade agreements with our customers include payments for in store displays  volume rebates  featured advertising and other growth incentives 
a number of our customer trade agreements are based on quarterly and annual targets that generally do not exceed one year 
estimated amounts to be paid to our customers for trade 
table of contents agreements are based upon current performance  historical experience  forecasted volume and other performance criteria 
advertising and marketing costs we are involved in a variety of programs to promote our products 
we include advertising and marketing costs in selling  delivery and administrative expenses 
advertising and marketing costs were million  million and million in  and  respectively  before bottler incentives received from pepsico and other brand owners 
bottler incentives pepsico and other brand owners  at their discretion  provide us with various forms of bottler incentives 
these incentives cover a variety of initiatives  including direct marketplace support and advertising support 
we classify bottler incentives as follows direct marketplace support represents pepsico s and other brand owners agreed upon funding to assist us in offering sales and promotional discounts to retailers and is generally recorded as an adjustment to cost of sales 
if the direct marketplace support is a reimbursement for a specific  incremental and identifiable program  the funding is recorded as an adjustment to net revenues 
advertising support represents agreed upon funding to assist us for the cost of media time and promotional materials and is generally recorded as an adjustment to cost of sales 
advertising support that represents reimbursement for a specific  incremental and identifiable media cost  is recorded as a reduction to advertising and marketing expenses within selling  delivery and administrative expenses 
total bottler incentives recognized as adjustments to net revenues  cost of sales and selling  delivery and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations were as follows fiscal year ended net revenues cost of sales selling  delivery and administrative expenses total bottler incentives shipping and handling costs our shipping and handling costs are recorded primarily within selling  delivery and administrative expenses 
such costs recorded within selling  delivery and administrative expenses totaled billion  billion and billion in  and  respectively 
foreign currency gains and losses we translate the balance sheets of our foreign subsidiaries that do not operate in highly inflationary economies at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date  while we translate the statements of operations at the average rates of exchange during the year 
the resulting translation adjustments of our foreign subsidiaries are recorded directly to accumulated other comprehensive loss 
foreign currency gains and losses reflect both transaction gains and losses in our foreign operations  as well as translation gains and losses arising from the re measurement into us dollars of the net monetary assets of businesses in highly inflationary countries 
beginning january   turkey is no longer considered to be a highly inflationary economy for accounting purposes 
we do not expect any material impact on our consolidated financial statements as a result of turkey s change in functional currency 

table of contents pension and postretirement medical benefit plans we sponsor pension and other postretirement medical benefit plans in various forms covering substantially all employees who meet eligibility requirements 
we account for our defined benefit pension plans and our postretirement medical benefit plans using actuarial models required by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
the assets  liabilities and assumptions used to measure pension and postretirement medical expense for any fiscal year are determined as of september of the preceding year measurement date 
the discount rate assumption used in our pension and postretirement medical benefit plans accounting is based on current interest rates for high quality  long term corporate debt as determined on each measurement date 
in evaluating the expected rate of return on assets for a given fiscal year  we consider both projected future returns of asset classes and the actual to year historic returns on asset classes in our pension investment portfolio  reflecting the weighted average return of our asset allocation 
differences between actual and expected returns are recognized in the net periodic pension calculation over five years 
to the extent the amount of all unrecognized gains and losses exceeds percent of the larger of the pension benefit obligation or plan assets  such amount is amortized over the average remaining service period of active participants 
we amortize prior service costs on a straight line basis over the average remaining service period of employees expected to receive benefits 
income taxes our effective tax rate is based on pre tax income  statutory tax rates  tax regulations and tax planning strategies available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
the tax bases of our assets and liabilities reflect our best estimate of the tax benefit and costs we expect to realize 
we establish valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized 
significant management judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax position 
we establish reserves when  based on the applicable tax law and facts and circumstances relating to a particular transaction or tax position  it becomes probable that the position will not be sustained when challenged by a taxing authority 
a change in our tax reserves could have a significant impact on our results of operations 
earnings per share we compute basic earnings per share by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period 
diluted earnings per share reflect the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised and converted into common stock that would then participate in net income 
cash equivalents cash equivalents represent funds we have temporarily invested with original maturities not exceeding three months 
allowance for doubtful accounts a portion of our accounts receivable will not be collected due to bankruptcies and sales returns 
our accounting policy for the provision for doubtful accounts requires reserving an amount based on the evaluation of the aging of accounts receivable  sales return trend analysis  detailed analysis of high risk customers accounts  and the overall market and economic conditions of our customers 
inventories we value our inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
the cost of our inventory is generally computed on the first in  first out method 
property  plant and equipment we state property  plant and equipment pp e at cost  except for pp e that has been impaired  for which we write down the carrying amount to estimated fair market value  which then becomes the new cost basis 
goodwill and other intangible assets  net goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized  but instead tested annually for impairment 
we evaluate our identified intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment annually unless it is required more frequently because of a triggering event 
we measure impairment as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value 
based upon our annual impairment analysis performed in the fourth quarter of  the estimated fair values of our identified intangible assets with indefinite lives exceeded their carrying amounts 
we evaluate goodwill on a country by country basis reporting unit for impairment 
we evaluate each reporting unit for impairment based upon a two step approach 
first  we compare the fair value of our reporting unit with its carrying value 
second  if the carrying value of our reporting unit exceeds its fair value  we compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill to its carrying amount to measure the amount of impairment loss 
in measuring the implied fair value of goodwill  we would allocate the fair value of the reporting unit to each of its assets and liabilities including any unrecognized intangible assets 
any excess of the fair value of the reporting 
table of contents unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
based upon our annual impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of  the estimated fair value of our reporting units exceeded their carrying value  and as a result  we did not need to proceed to the second step of the impairment test 
other identified intangible assets that are subject to amortization are amortized on a straight line basis over the period in which we expect to receive economic benefit and are reviewed for impairment when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
the determination of the expected life will be dependent upon the use and underlying characteristics of the intangible asset 
in our evaluation of the intangible assets  we consider the nature and terms of the underlying agreements  the customer s attrition rate  competitive environment and brand history  as applicable 
if the carrying value is not recoverable  impairment is measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value 
fair value is generally estimated based on either appraised value or other valuation techniques 
casualty insurance costs in the united states  we are self insured or have large deductible programs for workers compensation and automobile risks for occurrences up to million  and product and general liability risks for occurrences up to million 
for losses exceeding these self insurance thresholds  we purchase casualty insurance from a third party provider 
our liability for casualty costs was million as of december  of which million was reported in accounts payable and other current liabilities and million was recorded in other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
our liability for casualty costs is estimated using individual case based valuations and statistical analyses and is based upon historical experience  actuarial assumptions and professional judgment 
we do not discount our loss expense reserves 
minority interest pbg and pepsico contributed bottling businesses and assets used in the bottling businesses to bottling group  llc  our principal operating subsidiary  in connection with the formation of bottling group  llc in february at december   pbg owns percent of bottling group  llc and pepsico owns the remaining percent 
accordingly  the consolidated financial statements reflect pepsico s share of the consolidated net income of bottling group  llc as minority interest in our consolidated statements of operations  and pepsico s share of consolidated net assets of bottling group  llc as minority interest in our consolidated balance sheets 
treasury stock we record the repurchase of shares of our common stock at cost and classify these shares as treasury stock within shareholders equity 
repurchased shares are included in our authorized and issued shares but not included in our shares outstanding 
we record shares reissued using an average cost 
at december  we had million shares authorized under our share repurchase program 
since the inception of our share repurchase program in october  we have repurchased approximately million shares and have reissued approximately million for stock option exercises 
financial instruments and risk management we use derivative instruments to hedge against the risk of adverse movements associated with commodity prices  interest rates and foreign currency 
our corporate policy prohibits the use of derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes  and we have procedures in place to monitor and control their use 
all derivative instruments are recorded at fair value as either assets or liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
derivative instruments are generally designated and accounted for as either a hedge of a recognized asset or liability fair value hedge or a hedge of a forecasted transaction cash flow hedge 
the derivative s gain or loss recognized in earnings is recorded consistent with the expense classification of the underlying hedged item 
if a fair value or cash flow hedge were to cease to qualify for hedge accounting or were terminated  it would continue to be carried on the balance sheet at fair value until settled  but hedge accounting would be discontinued prospectively 
amounts previously deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss would be recognized immediately in earnings 
we also may enter into a derivative instrument for which hedge accounting is not required because it is entered into to offset changes in the fair value of an underlying transaction recognized in earnings natural hedge 
these instruments are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings 
stock based employee compensation we measure stock based compensation expense using the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related interpretations 
accordingly  compensation expense for stock option grants to 
table of contents our employees is measured as the excess of the quoted market price of common stock at the grant date over the amount the employee must pay for the stock

 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  we have elected to continue to apply the intrinsic value based method of accounting described above  and have adopted the disclosure requirements of sfas no

 share based payment sfas r

sfas r eliminates the alternative use of accounting principles board apb no 
s intrinsic value method of accounting for awards 
in fiscal year and earlier  the company accounted for stock options according to the provisions of apb no 
and related interpretations  and accordingly no compensation expense was required 
the company will adopt sfas r in the first quarter of by using the modified prospective approach 
under this method  we will recognize compensation expense for all share based payments over the vesting period based on their grant date fair value 
measurement and our method of amortization of costs for share based payments granted prior to  but not vested as of the date of adoption  would be based on the same estimate of the grant date fair value and the same amortization method that was previously used in our sfas pro forma disclosure 
prior periods will not be restated 
currently  the company uses the black scholes merton option 
table of contents pricing model to estimate the value of stock options granted to employees in its pro forma disclosure and plans to continue to use this method upon adoption of sfas r 
the financial statement impact will be dependent on future stock based awards and any unvested stock options outstanding at the date of adoption 
we expect the adoption of sfas r to reduce our diluted eps by per share 
commitments and contingencies we are subject to various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits  taxes  environmental and other matters arising out of the normal course of business 
liabilities related to commitments and contingencies are recognized when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable

the franchise licensing agreements for the squirt trademark were considered to have an indefinite life and granted the pepsi bottling group mexico srl pbg mexico the exclusive right to produce  sell and distribute beverages under the squirt trademark in certain territories of mexico 
in december  cadbury bebidas  sa de sa cadbury mexico  the owner of the squirt trademark  sent pbg mexico notices that purportedly terminated the squirt licenses for these territories effective january  pbg mexico believes that these licenses continue to be in effect and that cadbury mexico has no legally supportable basis to terminate the licenses 
however  as a result of these unanticipated actions  pbg mexico was no longer certain that it will have the right to distribute squirt in mexico after certain of its contractual rights expire in accordingly  we have concluded that the franchise rights relating to the squirt trademark should no longer be considered to have an indefinite life  but should be treated as having a year life for accounting purposes 
due to the reduction in the useful life of these franchise rights  we wrote the carrying value of the squirt franchise rights down to its current estimated fair value in the remaining carrying value will be amortized over the estimated useful life of years 
we measured the fair value of squirt s franchise rights using a multi period excess earnings method  which was based upon estimated discounted future cash flows for years 
we deducted a contributory charge from our net after tax cash flows for the economic return attributable to the working capital and property  plant and equipment  for squirt s franchise rights

we use future and option contracts to hedge the risk of adverse movements in commodity prices related primarily to anticipated purchases of aluminum and fuel used in our operations 
these contracts generally range from one to months in duration and qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment 
we are subject to foreign currency transactional risks in certain of our international territories for transactions that are denominated in currencies that are different from their functional currency 
beginning in  we entered into forward exchange contracts to hedge portions of our forecasted us dollar purchases in our canadian business 
these contracts generally range from one to months in duration and qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment 
we have also entered into several treasury rate lock agreements to hedge against adverse interest rate changes on certain debt financing arrangements 
for a cash flow hedge  the effective portion of the change in the fair value of a derivative instrument  which is highly effective  is deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the underlying hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of a fair value change on a qualifying cash flow hedge is recognized in earnings immediately and is recorded consistent with the expense classification of the underlying hedged item

the ineffective portion of the change in fair value of these contracts was not material to our results of operations in  or fair value hedges we finance a portion of our operations through fixed rate debt instruments 
we effectively converted million of our senior notes to floating rate debt through the use of interest rate swaps with the objective of reducing our overall borrowing costs 
these interest rate swaps meet the criteria for fair value hedge accounting and are percent effective in eliminating the market rate risk inherent in our long term debt 
accordingly  any gain or loss associated with these swaps is fully offset by the opposite market impact on the related debt 
the change in fair value of the interest rate swaps was a decrease of million and million in and  respectively

unfunded deferred compensation liability our unfunded deferred compensation liability is subject to changes in our stock price as well as price changes in other equity and fixed income investments 
participating employees in our deferred compensation program can elect to defer all or a portion of their compensation to be paid out on a future date or dates 
as part of the deferral process  employees select from phantom investment options that determine the earnings on the deferred compensation liability and the amount that they will ultimately receive 
employee investment elections include pbg stock and a variety of other equity and fixed income investment options 
since the plan is unfunded  employees deferred compensation amounts are not directly invested in these investment vehicles 
instead  we track the performance of each employee s investment selections and adjust his or her deferred compensation account accordingly 
the adjustments to the employees accounts increases or decreases the deferred compensation liability reflected on our consolidated balance sheets with an offsetting increase or decrease to our selling  delivery and administrative expenses 
we use prepaid forward contracts to hedge the portion of our deferred compensation liability that is based on our stock price 
at december   we had a prepaid forward contract for  shares at a price of  which was accounted for as a natural hedge 
this contract requires cash settlement and has a fair value at december   of million recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets 
the fair value of this contract changes based on the change in our stock price compared with the contract exercise price 
we recognized million in income in and million in income in  resulting from the change in fair value of these prepaid forward contracts 
the earnings impact from these instruments is classified as selling  delivery and administrative expenses 
other financial assets and liabilities financial assets with carrying values approximating fair value include cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable 
financial liabilities with carrying values approximating fair value include accounts payable and other accrued liabilities and short term debt 
the carrying value of these financial assets and liabilities approximates fair value due to their short maturities and since interest rates approximate current market rates for short term debt 
long term debt at december   had a carrying value and fair value of billion and billion  respectively  and at december   had a carrying value and fair value of billion and billion
