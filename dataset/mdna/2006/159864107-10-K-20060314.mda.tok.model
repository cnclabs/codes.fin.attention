item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading global provider of solutions that advance the drug discovery and development process 
these solutions include research models and outsourced preclinical and clinical services  and are designed to enable our clients to bring drugs to market faster and more efficiently 
our products and services are organized into three categories spanning every step of the drug development pipeline research models and services  preclinical services  and clinical services 
we have been in business for more than years  and our customer base includes all of the major pharmaceutical companies and many biotechnology companies  government agencies  leading hospitals and academic institutions 
our significant sales growth during was primarily due to the acquisition of inveresk at the end of  as well as organic growth in all segments 
our overall results of operations were further enhanced by the completion of the integration of inveresk unifying our products and services under our strong brand name  the harmonizing of best practices derived from the combination  and our achievement of our cost savings goal 
the businesses that we acquired in the inveresk acquisition primarily our preclinical services and clinical services segments traditionally experience margins less robust than in our historical rms segment  and the overall impact on our total margins were clearly reflected for the first time in fiscal future drivers for our products and services as a whole are primarily expected to emerge from our customers continued growing demand for drug discovery and development services  including increased strategic focus on outsourcing should drive future sales for our products and services 
to take advantage of these long term opportunities  we are engaged in a substantial capacity expansion program  with approximately million allocated for these capital expenditures 
in addition to internally generated organic growth  our business strategy includes strategic bolt on acquisitions that complement our business and increase the rate of our growth 
our total net sales in were billion  an increase of over the prior year due primarily to the acquisition of inveresk  as well as organic growth in all segments 
pro forma sales growth was which included a negative impact of foreign currency translation 
our gross margin decreased to of net sales  compared to of net sales for the prior years period  due to the greater proportion of preclinical and clinical services in the sales mix as well as a decline in the research models and services gross margin rate 
operating income for the year was million compared to million for the operating margin for was compared to for the prior year 
our operating margin rate was unfavorably impacted by million due to amortization of intangibles related to the acquisition of inveresk of million  stock based compensation expense related to the acquisition of inveresk of million  the impairment of the wisconsin preclinical services business of million  a charge for the acceleration of certain stock options of million  clinical services lease impairment of million  and million in fees related to the repatriation of cash pursuant to the american jobs creation act of ajca 
net income was million in compared to million in diluted earnings per share for were compared to in our increased earnings in were due to the acquisition of inveresk  as well as organic growth in all segments 
in addition  results were impacted favorably by the reversal of a deferred tax liability million and unfavorably impacted by the operating income items of million  discussed above  as well as the deferred financing write off of million related to the ajca cash repatriation 
our rms segment  representing of net sales in  includes sales of research models  transgenic services  laboratory services  preconditioning and surgical services  consulting and staffing services  vaccine support and in vitro technology primarily exdotoxin testing 
net sales for this segment increased over the same period in due to growth in research model  laboratory services and in vitro sales  partially offset by lower transgenic sales 
in  the rms business continued to benefit from the market for a number of our product lines  and particularly in specialty models and in vitro sales  although we were negatively impacted by the continuing slowdown in the transgenics services market in the us overall rms operating margin remained essentially flat at of net sales in  compared to of net sales for the prior year 
during we will add new capacity in california to meet our customers increased need for models  preconditioning services and value added model characterization services for their drug discovery and development efforts 
preconditioning services presents an excellent opportunity for future growth  as over the next two years we intend to open at least one new room at each of our breeding facilities to take advantage of our core competency of laboratory animal medicine  which should permit our customers to take advantage of outsourcing efficiencies these capabilities will provide 
our preclinical services segment  representing of net sales in  includes products and services required to take a drug or medical device through the development process including discovery support services  toxicology services  interventional pathology services  biopharmaceutical services  and bioanalysis  pharmacokinetics and drug metabolism services 
sales for this segment increased over the same period last year which included pro forma sales growth of due mainly to the inveresk acquisition and the continued favorable market conditions this year as demand remained strong  especially for toxicology 
our primary focus during was in integrating inveresk s preclinical services business with ours while maintaining operating growth 
fortunately  our preclinical services business continued to experience favorable market conditions this year as demand remained strong  especially for toxicology services  although sales growth was negatively impacted by softness in our interventional and surgical services and biopharmaceutical services businesses 
in addition  operating margins in preclinical services benefited from increased operating efficiencies  although there was a noted decrease in operating margins in the fourth quarter of primarily attributable to an extra week in the quarter 
we expect to see improving levels of customer demand in certain of our development services businesses  particularly large animal  reproductive toxicology and inhalation 
we continue to focus on meeting the growing demand for our preclinical services and increased outsourcing trends through our expansion program 
during we opened new capacity in montreal  canada and purchased an additional facility in massachusetts which we expect will be outfitted and online in late and in the first quarter of in addition  in  we plan to bring on new capacity in edinburgh  scotland as well as purchase a new west coast preclinical facility which we expect will be online in our clinical services segment  which represented of net sales in  was created as a result of the acquisition of inveresk s clinical service business 
this business segment conducts phase i clinical trials and provides phase ii iv clinical trials management services which include testing  medical data sciences services and regulatory support 
our clinical services business benefits from our focus on key therapeutic areas including oncology  ophthalmology  cardiovascular  respiratory  and infectious diseases 
we believe that our clinical services segment can succeed best though this targeted focus offering technical depth in a limited number of specialties and an emphasis on margin improvement 
in  we observed a lengthening of time to convert verbal awards to signed contracts  which negatively impacted sales growth throughout the industry  but particularly in the us in  we enhanced our medical data services capabilities through technological investments which are intended to enhance our service offerings 
overall  in  we are focusing on clinical services margin expansion and should benefit towards this goal from our fourth quarter personnel and facilities reductions 
the following tables show the net sales and the percentage contribution of each of our reportable segments for the past three years

on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and assumptions 
some of those estimates can be complex and require management to make estimates about the future and actual results could differ from those estimates 
management bases its estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
for any given estimate or assumption made by management  there may also be other estimates or assumptions that are reasonable 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the consolidated financial statements of charles river laboratories international  inc which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
management believes the following critical accounting policies are most affected by significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the following summary should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this form k 
we believe the following critical accounting policies and estimates affected our more significant judgments and estimates than usual in the preparation of our consolidated financial statement goodwill and other intangible assets revenue recognition pension plan accounting income taxes and deferred tax assets goodwill  other intangible assets 
we have intangible assets  including goodwill and other identifiable finite and indefinite lived acquired intangibles on our balance sheet due to the acquisition of inveresk as well other businesses we acquired 
the identification and valuation of these intangible assets and the determination of the estimated useful lives at the time of acquisition require significant management judgments and estimates 
these estimates are made based on  among others  input from an accredited independent valuation consultant  reviews of projected future income cash flows and statutory regulations 
the use of alternative estimates and assumptions could increase or decrease the estimated fair value of our goodwill and other intangible assets  and potentially result in a different impact to our results of operations 
we perform an annual review of goodwill to determine if an impairment exists 
goodwill is considered impaired if we determine that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value 
assessing the impairment of goodwill requires us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the fair value of the net assets of our reporting units 
our evaluation includes management estimates of cash flow projections based on an internal strategic review 
key assumptions  strategies  opportunities and risks from this strategic review along with a market evaluation are the basis for our assessment 
our market capitalization was also compared to the discounted cash flow analysis 
we performed annual impairment tests in and concluded the goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible asset balances were not impaired 
as of december   we had recorded goodwill and other intangibles of billion in the consolidated balance sheet 
the results of this year s impairment review is as of a point in time and changes in future business strategy or market conditions could significantly impact the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of these assets in subsequent years 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue on product and services sales 
we record product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
recognition of service revenue is primarily based on the completion of agreed upon service procedures including rate specified contracts and fixed fee contracts 
revenue of agreed upon rate contracts is recognized as services are performed  based on rates specified in the contract 
revenue of fixed fee contracts is recognized as services are performed in accordance with procedures specified by the customers in the form of study protocols 
the recognition of service revenue requires management judgments primarily relating to the determination of the level of service procedures performed during the period 
in some cases  a portion of the contract fee is paid at the time the study is initiated 
these advances are deferred and recognized as revenue as services are performed 
conversely  in some cases  revenue is recorded based on the level of service performed in advance of billing the customer 
this revenue is recorded as unbilled sales 
as of december   we had recorded unbilled revenue of million and deferred revenue of million in our consolidated balance sheet based on the difference between the estimated level of services performed and the billing arrangements defined by our service contracts 
pension plan accounting 
as of december   we had a pension liability of million 
the actuarial computations require the use assumptions to estimate the total benefits ultimately payable to employees and allocate this cost to the service periods 
the key assumptions include the discount rate  the expected return on plan assets and expected future rate of salary increases 
in addition  our actuaries determine the expense or liability of the plan using other assumptions for future experiences such as withdrawal and mortality rate 
the key assumptions used to calculate pension costs are determined and reviewed annually by management after consulting with outside investment advisors and actuaries 
the assumed discount rate  which is intended to be the actual rate at which benefits could effectively be settled  is adjusted based on the change in the long term bond yield as of the measurement date 
as of december  the weighted average discount rate for our pension plans was 
the assumed expected return on plan assets is the average return expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide future benefits to pension plan participants 
this includes considering the assets allocation and expected returns likely to be earned over the life of the plan 
if the actual return is different from the assumed expected return in plan assets  the difference would be amortized over a period of approximately to years 
during  based on our most recent analysis of historical and projected returns  we lowered our expected return on plan assets resulting in a weighted average return of from 
this is expected to increase the annual pension expense by approximately million in the estimated effect of a change in the expected rate of return would increase pension expense by million 
income taxes and deferred tax assets 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our current tax exposure and assessing temporary and permanent differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
in certain cases  we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position or results of operations 
as of december   we had a valuation allowance of approximately million 
the valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets for net operating loss carryforwards in jurisdictions where management does not believe it is more likely than not a benefit will be realized 
approximately million of the valuation allowance was established against deferred tax assets acquired as part of the inveresk acquisition and any future recognition of the asset will result in an adjustment to goodwill 
we have recognized the balance of the deferred tax asset on the belief that it is more likely than not it will be realized 
this belief is based on all available evidence including historical operating results  projections of taxable income  and tax planning strategies 
as of december   earnings of non us subsidiaries considered to be indefinitely reinvested totaled million 
no provision for us income taxes has been provided thereon 
upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise  we would be subject to both us taxes and withholding taxes payable to the various foreign countries 
it is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional tax that might be payable on this undistributed foreign income 
we are a worldwide business and operate in various tax jurisdictions where tax laws and tax rates are subject to change given the political and economic climate in these countries 
we report and pay income taxes based upon operational results and applicable law 
our tax provision contemplates tax rates in effect to determine both the current and deferred tax position 
any significant fluctuation in rates or in tax laws could cause our estimate of taxes that we anticipate to change 
these changes could result in either increases or decreases in our effective tax rate 
our tax positions are consistently subject to challenge by taxing authorities around the world 
due to our size and the number of tax jurisdictions within which we conduct our business operations  we are subject to tax audits on a regular basis 
as a result  we have tax reserves which are attributable to potential tax obligations around the world 
we believe the reserves are necessary to adequately reflect tax obligations which may arise out of current and future audits

on december   we amended and restated our then existing million credit agreement to modify certain restrictive covenants as well as provide for a million term loan facility and a million revolving facility for a canadian subsidiary and a million term loan facility and a million revolving facility for two uk subsidiaries the million credit agreement 
our now million credit agreement originally provided for a million term loan facility and a million revolving facility 
the million term loan facility matures in equal  quarterly installments with the last installment due september  the million revolving facility matures on october  and requires no scheduled payment before that date 
the new canadian and uk term loans aggregate million under the million credit agreement are repayable in full by september  and require no scheduled prepayment before that date 
the new revolving facilities aggregate million mature on october  and require no scheduled prepayment before that date 
the interest rate applicable to the canadian and uk term loans and the canadian and uk revolving loans under the credit agreement is the adjusted libor rate in its relevant currency plus an interest rate margin based upon the our leverage ratio 
the interest rates applicable to term loans and revolving loans under the credit agreement are  at our option  equal to either the base rate which is the higher of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus or the adjusted libor rate plus an interest rate margin based upon our leverage ratio 
based on our leverage ratio  the margin range for libor based loans is to

this revised standard will be effective for us beginning with the first quarter in as permitted by sfas no 
 we currently account for share based payments to employees using apb intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas no 
r s fair value method will have an impact on our financial statements  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the impact of the modified prospective adoption of sfas no 
r cannot be estimated at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted sfas no 
r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk certain of our financial instruments are subject to market risks  including interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rates 
we generally do not use financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
interest rate risk the fair value of our marketable securities is subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
if market rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by basis points from levels at december   then the fair value of the portfolio would decline by approximately million 
we have entered into two credit agreements  the million credit agreement and the million credit agreement 
our primary interest rate exposure results from changes in libor or the base rates which are used to determine the applicable interest rates under our term loans in the million credit agreement and in the million agreement and our revolving credit facilities 
our potential loss over one year that would result from a hypothetical  instantaneous and unfavorable change of basis points in the interest rate would be approximately million on a pre tax basis 
the book value of our debt approximates fair value 
during the second quarter of  we converted all of its million senior convertible debentures due february  into  shares of common stock 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we operate on a global basis and have exposure to some foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for our earnings and cash flows 
this risk is mitigated by the fact that various foreign operations are principally conducted in their respective local currencies 
a portion of our foreign operations revenue is denominated in us dollars  with the costs accounted for in their local currencies 
we attempt to minimize this exposure by using certain financial instruments  for purposes other than trading  in accordance with our overall risk management and our hedge policy 
in accordance with our hedge policy  we designate such transactions as hedges as set forth in sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
during  we utilized foreign exchange contracts  principally to hedge the impact of currency fluctuations on customer transactions and certain balance sheet items 
no material  foreign exchange contracts were outstanding on december
