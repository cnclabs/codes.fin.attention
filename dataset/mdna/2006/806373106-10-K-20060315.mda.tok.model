executive level overview a majority of our revenues are driven by marketing and advertising spending by consumer product companies and retailers 
the markets served are consumer product manufacturers and pharmaceutical  entertainment  retail and publishing companies 
our business involves producing graphic images for various applications 
generally  a graphic image is created by us or a third party and then the company manipulates that image to enhance the color of the image and to prepare it for print 
the applications vary from consumer product packaging  including food and beverage packaging images  to retail advertisements in newspapers  including free standing inserts fsi s  magazine ads  publications  catalogs and textbooks 
the graphics process is generally the same regardless of the application 
the following steps in the graphics process must take place to produce a final image planning and messaging strategic design content creation file building retouching art production pre media the company s involvement in a client project may involve many of the above steps or just one of the steps  depending on the client s needs 
each client assignment  or job  is a custom job in that the image being produced is unique  even if it only involves a small change from an existing image  such as adding a low fat banner on a food package 
essentially  change equals revenue 
the company is paid for our graphic imaging work regardless of the success or failure of the food product  the promotion or the ad campaign 
historically  a substantial majority of our revenues have been derived from providing graphic services for consumer product packaging applications 
packaging changes occur with such frequency and lack of notice  and customer turn around requirements are so tight  that there is little backlog 
there are regular promotions throughout the year that create revenue opportunities for us  for example valentine s day  easter  fourth of july  back to school  halloween  thanksgiving and christmas 
in addition  there are event driven promotions that occur regularly  such as the super bowl  grammy awards  world series  indianapolis and the olympics 
lastly  there are a number of health related banners that are added to food and beverage packaging  such as heart healthy  low in carbohydrates  enriched with essential vitamins  low in saturated fat and caffeine free 
all of these items require new product packaging designs or changes in existing designs  in each case creating additional opportunities for revenue 
graphic services for the consumer products packaging industry generally involve higher margins due to the substantial expertise necessary to meet consumer products companies precise specifications and to quickly  consistently and efficiently bring their products to market  as well as due to the complexity and variety of packaging materials  shapes and sizes  custom colors and storage conditions 
as a result of our most recent acquisitions described below  the company has increased the percentage of our revenue derived from providing graphics services to our advertising and retail clients and added to our service offering graphic services to the entertainment  publishing  catalog and textbook markets 
these clients typically require high volume  commodity oriented prepress graphic services 
graphic services for these clients typically yield relatively lower margins due to the lower degree of complexity in providing such services  and 
table of contents the number and size of companies in the industry capable of providing such services 
as discussed more fully below under acquisitions and results of operations  the altered mix of services following our acquisitions of winnetts and seven has impacted our results of operations in and will continue to impact our results of operations in the future 
the company continues to review its operations to identify potential dispositions of assets that fail to meet our criteria for growth and profitability 
the company s ten largest clients accounted for approximately of our revenues in and of our revenues in in and  approximately and  respectively  of our total revenues came from our largest single client in the respective period 
the company currently expects that our single largest client in may reduce its business with us in by up to  approximately of our expected total annual revenue for as a result of a decision to substantially reduce its overall advertising budget 
while the company seeks to build long term client relationships  revenues from any particular client can fluctuate from period to period due to such client s purchasing patterns 
any termination of or significant reduction in our business relationship with any of our principal clients could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
acquisitions the company has grown our business through a combination of internal growth and acquisitions 
schawk has completed approximately acquisitions since the company s two most recent acquisitions have significantly expanded our service offerings and our geographic presence  making us the only independent prepress firm with operations in north america  europe and asia 
as a result of these acquisitions  the company is able to offer a broader range of services to our clients 
our expanded geographic presence also allows us to better serve our multinational clients demands for global brand consistency

the company is a service business whose major cost is employees labor 
material purchases are limited to supplies incidental to the services provided 
the company expects to fund future contractual obligations through funds generated from operations  together with general company financing transactions 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
the company believes that our critical accounting policies are limited to those described below 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivable 
our clients are primarily consumer product manufacturers  converters and advertising agencies  none of which individually represents more than of total revenue 
accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due to us from our normal business activities 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect the expected losses of accounts receivable based on past collection history and specific risks identified in the portfolio 
impairment of long lived assets 
the company records impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those items 
our cash flow estimates are based on historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions 
the net carrying value of assets not recoverable is reduced to fair value 
our estimates of fair value represent our best estimate based on industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions 
goodwill and other acquired intangible assets 
the company has made acquisitions in the past that included a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets 
effective in  goodwill is no longer amortized but is subject to an annual or under certain circumstances more frequent impairment test based on its estimated fair value 
other intangible assets that meet certain criteria continue to be amortized over their useful lives and are also subject to an impairment test based on estimated undiscounted cash flows 
there are many assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of an impairment loss 
another estimate 
table of contents using different  but still reasonable  assumptions could produce a significantly different result 
therefore  impairment losses could be recorded in the future 
the company performed the required impairment test of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets in  and it was determined appropriate to consider the company to be one reporting unit for purposes of this test 
customer rebates 
the company has rebate agreements with certain customers 
the agreements offer discount pricing based on volume over a multi year period 
the company accrues the estimated rebates over the term of the agreement  reducing revenue and crediting a current liability account 
at the end of the rebate accounting period  typically annually  the rebate is settled in cash and the accrued liability account is charged 
the company accounts for changes in the estimated rebate amounts as soon as it has determined that the estimated sales for the rebate period have changed 
stock based compensation 
as of december   the company had two stock based compensation plans which are described more fully in note the company accounts for those plans under the recognition and measurement principles of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
no stock based compensation cost is reflected in net income  as all options granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
during the first quarter of  the company will begin expensing stock options as required under sfas no 
r  share based payments 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in the form k for further discussion 
income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences and net operating losses will not be realized 
schawk  like other multi national companies  are regularly audited by federal  state and foreign tax authorities  and tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed 
accordingly  tax reserves have been recorded when  in management s judgment  it is not probable that our tax position will ultimately be sustained 
while predicting the outcome of the audits involves uncertainty and requires estimates and informed judgments  the company believes that the recorded tax liabilities are adequate and appropriate 
the judgments and estimates made at a point in time may change based on the outcome of tax audits  as well as changes to or further interpretation of regulations 
income tax expense is adjusted in the period in which these events occur or when the statute of limitations for a specific exposure item has expired 
exit reserves 
the company records reserves for the consolidation of workforce and facilities of acquired companies 
the exit plans are approved by company management prior to  or shortly after  the acquisition date and may be modified during the twelve month period following the acquisition  as conditions change 
the exit plans provide for severance pay  lease abandonment costs and other related expenses 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas r revised december  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
this statement requires that the fair value at the grant date resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements 
further  sfas r requires entities to apply a fair value based measurement method in accounting for these transactions 
this value is recorded over the vesting period 
this statement is effective for the first fiscal year beginning after june  the company plans to adopt the provisions of this statement using the modified prospective method 
the impact of adoption of sfas no 
r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had the company adopted sfas r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of 
table of contents sfas no 
as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter this amendment requires abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted materials spoilage to be recognized as current period charges 
this standard also requires that the allocation of fixed production overhead to the cost of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
this standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we will adopt the standard effective for our year 
we do not anticipate the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in may  sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
 was issued and is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  sfas no 
applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principles and to changes required by accounting pronouncements that do not contain transition provisions 
sfas no 
requires  among other things  the retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principles as opposed to including in net income the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principal in the period of adoption  which was the standard under apb opinion no 
 accounting changes 
the company expects that the adoption of sfas no 
will have no impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
impact of inflation the company believes that over the past three years inflation has not had a significant impact on the company s results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate exposure the company has million of variable rate debt outstanding at december  and expects to use its variable rate credit facilities during and beyond to fund acquisitions and cash flow needs 
assuming interest rate volatility in the future is similar to what has been seen in recent years  the company does not anticipate that short term changes in interest rates will materially affect its consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
a increase in short term interest rates would add of interest cost annually based on the variable rate debt outstanding at december  foreign exchange exposure the company has foreign operations that expose it to translation risk when the local currency financial statements are translated to us dollars 
since changes in translation risk are reported as adjustments to stockholders equity  a change in the foreign exchange rate would not have material effect on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows
