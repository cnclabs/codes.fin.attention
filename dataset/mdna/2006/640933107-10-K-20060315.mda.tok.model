our results continue to be adversely impacted by the flattening of the yield curve which reduced net interest earned on interest earning assets 
in addition  earnings were also negatively impacted by competitive market pressures within the financial intermediary segment  particularly within our nonconforming mortgage operations 
our results were also negatively impacted due to higher than anticipated required repurchases related to our representations and warranties on mortgages sold 
finally  we recorded an additional  provision during the third quarter of related to a select group of loans previously sold 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report for further discussion 
despite the factors above  management continued to make significant progress towards reaching its revenue diversification strategy 
management previously set a long term goal of achieving an equal balance of earnings between its retail banking  financial intermediary and transaction processing segments 
although the volatility in the financial intermediary segment manifested itself during with the segment reporting a pre tax loss of  resulting in net loss on a consolidated basis  we made progress in growing the pre tax earnings of our other business segments 
during and  the retail banking segment implemented a number of strategies to improve earnings including retaining a large portion of internally originated loans and leases that carry lower risks than loans previously held for investment 
the retail banking segment retained  of helocs   of auto loans and  of business finance leases in the retail banking segment s pre tax results improved by  to  for the year ended december  compared with the same period in included in the results is a  provision for loss on our investment in leases originated by cmc 
exclusive of this charge  the retail banking segment s pre tax results for would have improved by  over the transaction processing segment reported an improvement in pre tax earnings of this resulted from significant improvements at our netinsurance and nps subsidiaries as well as improved expense control in servicing operations 
future outlook our objective is to become a premier provider of financial products and services to our targeted market segments 
our strategy is multi faceted  involving retail banking 
netbank  fsb operates as an fdic insured  federally chartered thrift institution that currently serves over thousand customers throughout the united states and in more than foreign countries 
netbank  fsb operates a totally branchless model and passes on a portion of the cost savings to its customers in the form of attractive yields on deposits 
netbank  fsb s array of products and services are available to its customers hours per day  seven days a week  days a year 
financial intermediary 
through our mortgage banking operations  we serve as an intermediary between consumers and institutional investors 
we obtain mortgage loans by originating loans directly with consumers  through brokers or by buying closed loans from a network of correspondent banks  thrifts and independent mortgage companies 
the majority of these loans are held for sale on the company s balance sheet prior to delivery into the secondary market 
we thus earn a long term yield  on an asset held short term  and also earn origination and servicing revenues and gains on the sale of the mortgages or resulting mortgage backed securities sometimes referred to herein as mbs 
transaction processing 
the following summarizes our transaction processing initiatives we run a servicing factory that services over  loans for internal and external customers 
late in  we expanded our transaction processing capabilities by acquiring nps 
nps is one of the top five providers of atm services for retail and non bank businesses  and we have the nd largest bank operated atm network in the country 
at december   through organic growth and acquisition  nps operated  atm machines and  merchant processing terminals 
the atm network  in addition to supplying fee revenue  provides a convenient way for netbank fsb s customers to access cash throughout the united states 
check legislation was passed by congress in the fall of  and it became effective on october  banks may now clear checks through substitutes such as digital images 
the checks may be truncated  customers may be provided images of checks  and banks may exchange data instead of physical checks 
we have built a new processing engine that can do automatic clearing house ach and check clearing 
we offer these payment processing services to community banks and to our small business customers 
during  in partnership with the united postal service ups store  we developed a deposit and payment forwarding service called quickpost 
using quickpost  customers take their checks and completed deposit slip or payment coupon to the nearest location of the ups store 
once there  customers place their items in a quickpost envelope and submit the envelope for delivery to netbank at no cost to them 
all quickpost envelopes are then sent via ups next day air delivery from the ups store to our state of the art payment processing center 
this new service has enhanced netbank fsb s ability to efficiently serve its customers in a branchless  internet only environment 
we now offer quickpost to other financial institutions that have a limited retail presence nationwide 
in  we announced a strategy to diversify our earnings so that one third is provided by each of our principal operating segments retail banking  financial intermediary and transaction processing 
over the long term  our goal is to achieve a better  more stable  balance across our different segments 
but  over the short term  we have had to adjust  and may continue to have to adjust  that targeted balance as market conditions dictate  and one segment may outperform the others 
the objective of diversifying our efforts across different but complementary lines of business is to have options and opportunities to manage our complementary businesses through different economic environments 
the following summarizes pre tax loss income by segment for the years ended december   and the retail banking segment results for include the million provision for credit losses on our cmc lease portfolio as discussed below 
retail banking financial intermediary transaction processing other eliminations total we are pleased with the progress made in and in expanding earnings from our retail banking and transaction processing segments 
however  as discussed below  unpredictability in the earnings of the financial intermediary segment continues to make our consolidated earnings volatile 
we believe that our deposit base will continue to grow as internet usage and internet based commerce grow 
we believe that we can continue to invest those deposits profitably in mortgage loans held temporarily for sale and loans held for investment 
we also believe that non interest earnings in the form of fees and gains on sale resulting from our financial intermediary and transaction processing activities can potentially provide a better diversity of earnings than the traditional banking model 
while we are optimistic about our short and long term prospects  the following should be considered in evaluating our earnings and growth outlook 
volatility of mortgage banking income 
all of our earnings in came from the financial intermediary segment when mortgage interest rates were at historically low levels 
this prompted refinance and home purchase mortgage volumes to grow to the highest levels in history 
total mortgage industry production volumes were just under trillion for interest rates began climbing during the third quarter of  and mortgage banking industry production volumes dropped to trillion during estimated mortgage banking industry production for is trillion  flat when compared to production 
as production volumes dropped in and relative to the record production levels in  competitive pressures mounted  resulting in a drop in gain on sale margins in and compared to the decrease in compared with related primarily to lower margins in the non conforming mortgage business as new market participants  especially portfolio lenders focused on leveraging up their balance sheets as quickly as possible  engaged in aggressive pricing to capture market share 
the mortgage bankers association of america s forecast calls for total mortgage production of trillion for  representing a drop in volume from although we believe that our offerings of adjustable rate and other alternative mortgage products and the continued growth of our retail channel which is less dependent on refinance volume will soften some of the impact of declines in available volume  there can be no assurance that we will be able to sustain current production volume levels 
likewise  there is no assurance that the current competitive pressures  especially in the non conforming channel  will subside 
the following summarizes some of our significant threats and opportunities under a reduced volume scenario total production volume could decline  resulting in less net interest margin on loans held for sale  less gain on sale  and less production related fee revenue 
gain on sale margins could remain at present levels or drift even lower due to increased competition for available mortgage application volume 
production costs per unit could rise as the result of a reduction in leverage gained on fixed costs fixed costs are spread over a smaller number of units 
this impact may be offset  in part  by the following additional potential effects of the rising rate environment the value of mortgage servicing rights could increase as actual and forecasted prepayments go down 
although these assets are carried at the lower of cost or market  accounting rules allow for the reversal of previously established reserves as a result of impairment 
recent accounting pronouncements will allow us to elect fair value accounting for our servicing rights commencing january  however  as servicing values rise  our servicing hedge values would go down  offsetting a portion of the reserve recovery or increase in fair value 
with reduced prepayments  mortgage servicing revenues would improve 
the company could elect to take a portion of existing excess liquidity and liquidity freed up by the reduced loan production volume and invest in additional interest earning assets at the then higher interest rates 
material pending litigation 
as discussed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report  we are involved in litigation with three insurance companies who are sureties on some of netbank  fsb s commercial lease portfolios 
netbank  fsb has filed a claim for payments that are currently past due 
during  in response to settlements between the sureties and other holders of cmc leases  we recorded an additional million in allowance for credit losses and wrote our carrying value on the cmc leases down by million resulting in a remaining balance of million 
through additional cash receipts  the remaining book balance of cmc receivables was down to million at december  the entire portfolio is on non accrual status 
in august  the us district court issued a favorable ruling for banks with respect to the multi district litigation mdl proceedings 
the court issued two opinions in which it ruled against one of the sureties  illinois union 
it is expected that illinois union will appeal 
with respect to the other two sureties  safeco and royal  the court did not grant the banks motion but instead stated that the banks must first prove that they were the intended obligee in the leases  and that there was no fraud on the part of the banks 
we believe our case is strong  and that we will be able to successfully assert that we were the intended obligee and that there was no fraud on our part 
during the fourth quarter of  the court ordered mediation through march  however  there is no assurance that the suit or resulting appeals will ultimately be decided in our favor nor is there any assurance as to the length of time it may take for us to prevail 
the following summarizes the material impact some of the possible outcomes could have on the results of our results of operations and financial condition for and beyond further victories in the action or a favorable settlement could result in our being able to recover all or a portion of the cmc lease receivables charged off in  a loss in the case against safeco or royal or in an appeal of the illinois union ruling could cause us to record additional provisions for loss on these assets and the continuation of non accrual status  and prolonged litigation could result in the continuation of non accrual status  continued payment of large legal fees  and the potential for recording additional provisions for losses on these assets in the future 
acquisitions 
as described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report  during we expanded our atm and merchant processing business by acquiring smaller processors or service contracts and expanded our retail mortgage origination operations by acquiring additional retail branches 
we do not expect to acquire a business that would be considered material ie  of pre tax income  total assets or total shareholders equity in the near future  however  we will continue to pursue strategic acquisitions such as these which fit into our long term strategy of diversifying our earnings by expanding less cyclical revenue generating operations 
flat treasury yield curve 
normally  short term interest rates are lower than long term interest rates 
however  continual increases by the federal reserve throughout and in targeted short term rates has caused the yield on short term treasury instruments to be only slightly below or at times equal to the yields of medium term and long term treasury securities 
this flattening of the yield curve adversely impacts our earnings as follows we earn less of a spread on loans held for sale that are financed with short term liabilities 
the risk adjusted net interest spread of incremental earning assets coming onto the balance sheet as held for investment or available for sale assets is lower than in a normal yield curve environment 
to the extent that any existing earning assets were funded by shorter duration liabilities  our net interest margin compresses as those liabilities re price 
capital constraints on retail bank growth 
one of the tactics in achieving the strategy of diversifying our revenue sources is to grow the earning assets of the bank 
we desire to maintain the bank s status as well capitalized under ots guidelines 
accordingly  the absence of earnings during is beginning to put constraints on further growth of the bank 
several times over the past few years netbank  inc has issued trust preferred securities and used the proceeds to infuse additional capital into the bank 
further offerings of trust preferred securities may not be successful in generating additional capital for the bank 
such capital constraints coupled with the impact discussed above of the flattening yield curve could cause the suspension of growth in earning assets 
see item a 
risk factors for more information regarding risks associated with failure to satisfy capital requirements 
impact of sfas r 
we will adopt sfas r  share based payment  effective january  we intend to adopt sfas r using the modified prospective transition provisions of sfas r  which will require financial statement recognition of the fair value of all share based payments that vest subsequent to adoption 
based on the historical level of share based awards  we have estimated that the adoption of sfas r will result in approximately million of additional compensation expense to be recorded in for a discussion of other recent accounting pronouncements  see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
financial condition general 
the company s assets totaled  at december   an increase of  or from december  this increase is primarily due to the following factors 
first  loans and leases receivables increased  as a result of management s decision to retain a greater portion of the company s internally originated loan and leases from our auto lending  mortgage operations and netbank business finance divisions 
secondly  loans held for sale also increased  this increase can be attributed to decreased sales in versus as production remained relatively flat 
in addition  mortgage servicing rights increased by  due to retention of servicing rights on internally produced loans  an acquisition of bulk servicing rights having a capitalized value of  and a  recovery of servicing rights 
these increases were partially offset by a  decrease in our investment securities available for sale to  at december  liabilities increased by  primarily related to an increase in deposits as we continue to experience growth within the retail banking segment 
other borrowed funds also increased  in order to support our growth in loan and lease receivables and loans held for sale portfolios 
investment securities 
our investment policy is designed to provide and maintain liquidity and to generate favorable returns without incurring undue interest rate risk  credit risk and investment portfolio concentrations 
in accordance with the policy  during  we sold certain investment securities for a net gain of  we may continue to acquire and dispose of securities within the parameters of our investment strategy which may result in additional gains or losses 
securities classified as available for sale are reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses  net of tax  reported in other comprehensive income 
all investment securities are currently classified as available for sale 
the following tables set forth certain information relating to our available for sale securities as of december  amortized cost unrealized gains unrealized losses estimated fair value us government agencies mbs collateralized mortgage obligations us treasury securities agency bonds habitat bonds and other total as of december  amortized cost unrealized gains unrealized losses estimated fair value us government agencies mbs collateralized mortgage obligations us treasury securities corporate bonds habitat bonds and other total as of december  amortized cost unrealized gains unrealized losses estimated fair value us government agencies mbs collateralized mortgage obligations us government agencies bonds corporate bonds habitat bonds and other total although certain securities have an unrealized loss that has persisted for more than continuous months  management does not believe that any of the securities within the portfolio are impaired 
we believe that the decrease in the value of the portfolio is related to increasing interest rates versus declining credit worthiness 
we performed an assessment and applied the principles of financial accounting standards board fasb staff position fsp  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  and concluded that an other than temporary impairment should not be recognized 
reference is made to note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional details regarding the maturity  duration of unrealized losses and weighted average interest rate of our investment securities available for sale portfolio 
loans held for sale 
for the year ended december   loans held for sale  which consist primarily of mortgage loans  increased by  to  compared to  as of december  this increase is the result of decreased sales volumes during industry wide production of mortgages and sales of mortgages decreased during primarily as a result of an increase in long term mortgage interest rates and generally softer demand 
loan and lease receivables 
for the year ended december   the loan and lease receivables portfolio increased  or to  at december  loan and lease receivables increased as a result of our strategy to selectively retain a larger portion of originated loans and leases 
during  we retained  of internally originated mortgage loans primarily helocs   of internally originated auto loans and  of originated business finance loans and leases 
the retention of these internally originated assets was offset  in part  by principal payments and reductions of  and  in first and seconds mortgages  respectively

see item legal proceedings  and notes  and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional details regarding our loan and lease receivables  including its investment in the cmc lease portfolio  the associated litigation and the associated allowance for credit losses 
the non cmc leases are originated by our netbank business finance division 
these leases consist primarily of equipment leases to small businesses 
the company provides an allowance for credit losses on such leases based upon life of lease loss estimates resulting from static loss analysis by vintage year of production 
the increase in the non cmc related reserves relates to the retention of leases by the company over time 
during and  our portfolios of helocs grew as a result of the retention of targeted products from our mortgage banking operations 
we provide an allowance for credit losses on all mortgage products based on a life of loan estimate of losses 
such life of loan loss estimates are based upon rating agency estimates of losses for mortgage backed securities containing loans with similar credit quality 
the company s allocated allowance for credit losses grew from  to  for helocs from december  to december  as the result of an increase in the underlying portfolios from  to  during the period 
the company s allocated allowance for credit losses for second mortgages decreased from  to  from december  to december  this decrease reflected a decrease of principal balance relating to payoffs of second mortgages and retention of selected second mortgages to borrowers with higher credit scores  resulting in reduced loss estimates as a percentage of outstanding principal 
in the spring of  we opened the dealer financial services division for the purpose of originating indirect auto loans through a third party network of regional auto dealers 
for such auto loans  the company provides  at a minimum  allowances based upon loss estimates for the next twelve months plus any additional amounts necessary for classified assets 
our loss estimates are based primarily on the credit scores of the underlying borrowers 
the company monitors its actual loss experience versus its expected loss experience and makes appropriate adjustments to its provision and allowance 
the increase in the company s allocated allowance from a december  balance of  to  as of december  resulted primarily from an increase in the underlying portfolio of  asset quality and non performing assets 
we periodically review the performance of our loan and lease receivables by reviewing charge offs  delinquency statistics and various other industry statistics 
large non homogeneous credits are reviewed on a loan by loan or lease by lease basis  whereas relatively small credits with similar risk characteristics are reviewed on a pool by pool basis 
if a decline in credit quality for a specific pool or individual loan or lease is noted  we record additional allowance through a charge to the provision for credit losses 
the allowance for credit losses is maintained at a level estimated to be adequate to provide for probable losses in the loan and lease receivables portfolio 
we determine the adequacy of the allowance based upon reviews of individual loans and leases  recent loss experience  current economic conditions  the risk characteristics of the various categories of loans and leases and other pertinent factors 
our non performing loan and lease receivables as a percentage of gross unpaid principal balance upb improved from at december   to at december  reference is made to note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information regarding the specific types and amounts of our non performing assets 
the following tables set forth information regarding our loan and lease receivables  including the allocated allowance and non accrual assets as of december  gross upb allocated allowance non performing first mortgages second mortgages leases auto home equity lines consumer loan and lease receivables cmc leases total as of december  gross upb allocated allowance non performing first mortgages second mortgages leases auto home equity lines consumer loan and lease receivables cmc leases total non performing includes all loans  including restructured loans  that are days or more contractually past due 
the company also held  and  of performing restructured loans as of december  and  respectively 
reference is made to note and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional details regarding the cmc lease portfolio 
as more fully described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report  our loans held for sale are carried at the aggregate of the lower of cost or market until being sold  typically to days after origination or purchase 
at december  and  the aggregate market value of loans held for sale exceeded the aggregate cost 
the majority of our non performing loans held for sale consist of loans which the company has been required to repurchase under representations and warranties provided to purchasers of our loans 
once a loan has been repurchased  it is generally resold at a loss 
upon repurchase  the company transfers reserves from its liability for representations and warranties to a valuation reserve for repurchased loans to record such loans at estimated net realizable value 
the following tables set forth information regarding our loans held for sale as of december  gross upb non performing reserve conforming mortgages non conforming mortgages construction commercial mortgages total held for sale assets as of december  gross upb non performing reserve conforming mortgages non conforming mortgages construction commercial mortgages total held for sale assets mortgage servicing rights 
we intend to retain substantially all of our originated conventional mortgage servicing rights msrs in order to achieve the necessary critical mass the transaction processing segment requires to sustain operational profitably 
during  execution of conforming conventional loans into the secondary market in whole loan  servicing released sales was frequently more profitable than creating mortgage backed securities and retaining the servicing rights 
however  the growth in the msrs during was attributed primarily to the purchase of a billion portfolio  having a capitalizable value of  in addition  we recorded a recovery of msr value of  these increases in msrs were partially off set by amortization of  derivatives 
the value of derivatives hedging the msr portfolio were  at december  compared to  at december   an increase of  the derivatives consist primarily of commitments to purchase mortgage pool securities  options  floors  swaps  swaptions  caps and floors 
the value of derivatives hedging the pipeline of msrs at december  was a loss of compared to a loss of at december  the value of our loan commitments for which the interest rate is locked rate locks decreased in value by from a gain of  as of december  to a gain of  as of december  our portfolio of mandatory delivery commitments hedging our rate locks at december  was a loss of  compared to a loss of at december  both of these amounts are marked to market and reflected in our consolidated statements of operations 
the value of mandatory delivery commitments hedging our inventory of closed loans at december  was a loss of  compared to a loss of  at december  liabilities 
total liabilities for the year ended december  increased  this increase was due primarily to an increase in deposits of  as a result of our continued growth in our deposit base 
this increase was in part off set by a decrease in unsettled trades of deposits 
deposits were  at december   a increase year over year compared to deposits of  at december  as of december   interest bearing deposits represented of total interest bearing liabilities including interest bearing deposits  other borrowed funds and subordinated debt outstanding 
at december   fhlb advances  warehouse lines of credit and repurchase agreements represented approximately  and subordinated debt represented less than 
in addition  checking accounts decreased primarily related to our strategy of growing profitable customer relationships which in nature include customers with more than a purely transactional account relationship 
money market accounts decreased year over year related primarily to our pricing less aggressively than we did in prior periods relative to competition 
certificates of deposit increased by  as we saw the opportunity to lock in rates in certain maturities in a rising rate environment

shareholders equity 
total shareholders equity decreased  for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily due to a  decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income oci and a decrease in retained earnings of  net loss for the year ended december  was and dividends paid aggregated  for the same period 
the oci decrease reflected the change in fair value of available for sale investment securities of  and the realization of  in after tax gains due to the sale of certain investment securities 
treasury stock increased  due to the repurchase of common stock of  which was offset  in part  by the reissuance of  of restricted stock related to the company s stock based incentive compensation plan 
critical accounting policies in response to the securities and exchange commission s rule disclosure in management s discussion and analysis about the application of critical accounting policies  the company s senior management  in conjunction with the audit committee of the board of directors  has identified valuation of mortgage servicing rights available for sale  determination of the allowance for credit losses  liabilities for representations and warranties on loans and mortgage servicing rights sold and derivatives hedging mortgage servicing rights available for sale as being the most critical accounting policies 
these policies were identified as being the most critical based on the sec s guidance in identifying them based on whether the accounting estimate required management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made and different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period  or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  would have a material impact on the presentation of the financial condition or results of operations 
valuation of mortgage servicing rights 
as more fully described in notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report  we account for our msrs under the guidance set forth in statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
for purposes of evaluating our msrs portfolio for impairment  we disaggregate our servicing portfolio into two primary groupings available for sale and held for sale 
the most important variables that require management to make estimates in the valuation of msrs available for sale are the prepayment rate and discount rate 
in determining the appropriate prepayment rate and discount rate to be used in its internal valuation models  we review current prepayment activities  historical prepayment activities  prevailing interest rates  general economic indicators and the secondary market for msrs 
the following table sets forth the change in value of the available for sale portfolio that would theoretically be recorded were management to choose to use a prepayment or discount rate that is or more adverse 
december  fair value weighted average life in years prepayment speed assumption annual rate impact on fair value of adverse change impact on fair value of adverse change discount rate impact on fair value of adverse change impact on fair value of adverse change the impacts displayed above for the available for sale portfolio would be a direct reduction to the value of msrs available for sale and a reduction of income by a nearly corresponding amount via an impairment charge 
the sensitivities above are hypothetical and should be used with caution 
as the figures indicate  changes in fair value based on a variation in an assumption generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear 
also  in the table above  the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the available for sale servicing rights portfolio is calculated without changing any other assumption 
in reality  changes in one factor may result in changes in another  which might magnify or counteract the sensitivities 
netbank holds an additional  of msrs that management considers held for sale  which are not included in the preceding table 
the held for sale portfolio s value is based on its forward committed prices and therefore would not be subject to the types of value changes referred to in the discussion above 
allowance for credit losses 
in determining the appropriate amount of allowance for credit losses management is required to make estimates regarding the credit quality of borrowers  general economic conditions and various other factors that would impact the probability of loans or leases being repaid in full 
accordingly  management uses both internally developed and external metrics and considers economic indicators as well as other factors to determine the appropriate range level at which the allowance should be maintained 
at december   netbank had billion of loan and lease receivables and  of allowance for credit losses  a coverage ratio of  and incurred  of provision expense related to maintaining the allowance within the appropriate range 
netbank recorded net charge offs of  during liability for representations and warranties 
in the ordinary course of business  we are exposed to liability  and potential losses  under representations and warranties made to purchasers and insurers of mortgage loans and the purchasers of msrs 
under certain circumstances  we may be required to repurchase mortgage loans or indemnify the purchasers of loans or servicing rights for losses if there has been a breach of representations or warranties 
estimation of a liability for such representations and warranties is difficult for two reasons 
first  since netbank is not the primary servicer for many of the loans or loans underlying the msrs it has sold in the past  it has no knowledge as to the current status of previously sold loans and msrs and the extent of the pipeline of unasserted repurchase requests 
second  as new mortgage products are introduced that may have documentation or underwriting criteria substantially different from products historically originated and sold  the company has no historic information with respect to the expected frequency of repurchase requests or of the expected loss severity for these new products 
we estimate our liability for representations and warranties using the best information we have under the circumstances 
for loan products where we have a history of past repurchase frequency and loss severity  we use that historical vintage loss data to project future liability 
however  since we are not the servicer and have no information of the current status of such loans  such historic repurchase frequency and loss severity may not be the best indicator of future repurchase losses as the result of changes in the levels of prepayments which affect repurchase frequency 
likewise  changes in general economic conditions such as unemployment levels and housing values can affect the frequency and loss severity of future repurchases under representations and warranties 
for new products that are substantially different in underwriting criteria and documentation standards than that of historic product offerings  we initially estimate repurchase frequency from initial quality control tests and use loss severity from other similar products 
as these new products season  we adjust our process to include the historical frequency and loss severity trends for the product 
our reserve for estimated losses for representations and warranties liability was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
changes to frequency or severity would cause linear changes to the reserve requirements 
the company repurchased approximately million and million of unpaid principal balances during and  respectively

we use derivative financial instruments as part of our risk management activities to protect the value of certain assets and liabilities against adverse price or interest rate movements 
all of the company s derivative instruments are carried at fair value on the balance sheet 
the valuation of these derivatives is critical because carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility 
the valuation of our derivatives is based on third party mid market quotes from a cross section of wall street dealers or from a model utilizing wall street accepted valuation methodologies  and is therefore  generally calibrated to third party mid market quotes 
because the majority of the derivative instruments on our balance sheet are used to protect the value of other assets and liabilities in our balance sheet  changes in the value of the derivative instruments are typically offset by changes in the value of the assets and liabilities being hedged 
income statement volatility can occur if the decision is made to not fully hedge the attendant risk  the costs related to hedging reduce the net benefit related to hedging the attendant risk or the derivative instruments are not effective in hedging changes in the value of those assets and liabilities 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business  we had contractual obligations to make scheduled payments for our operating leases  liability to repurchase loans under representations and warranties provided to purchasers of mortgage loans and msrs  and obligations to make scheduled principal and interest payments on borrowed funds 
we are not a party to any off balance sheet financing arrangements nor do we hold unconsolidated interests in any variable interest entities that could rise to future contractual obligations 
the following table summarizes our obligations under these arrangements by type and scheduled payment contractual obligations less than year years years after years total borrowed funds operating leases repurchase liabilities includes contractually due principal and interest

results of operations year ended december   compared to the year ended december  general 
net loss for the year ended december  was or per share  compared to net income of  or 
per share  for rising interest rates and interest rate volatility during continued to adversely impact the results reported from the financial intermediary segment 
mortgage loan production within the financial intermediary segment dropped from billion to billion  while sales of mortgage loans dropped from billion to billion comparing to  respectively 
netbank also experienced significant pressure on its margins in the financial intermediary segment from increasing competition  especially in the nonconforming channel 
the financial intermediary segment s pre tax income was down million as a result 
this was offset by improved results in the retail banking segment which posted a pre tax income of million during compared with a pre tax loss of million during included in the retail banking segment loss in was an additional provision for credit losses on the cmc leases of million 
in the absence of that provision  the retail banking segment would have reported pre tax earnings of million in interest income 
netbank s interest income for the year ended december  was  compared to  in as detailed in the following rate volume variance table  we lowered the average balance of our loans held for sale by  and increased the average balance of investment securities available for sale and loan and lease receivables by  and  respectively 
this repositioning resulted in a positive volume variance of  due to the increase in average interest earning assets 
in addition to the volume variance  the average rate on all interest earning assets increased from to  comparing to  which resulted in a positive rate variance of  the increase in loan and lease receivables is principally the result of our previously discussed strategy of retaining a higher portion of originated loans and leases 
during  netbank retained  of internally originated mortgage loans primarily helocs   of internally originated auto loans and  of originated business finance loans and leases 
interest expense 
total interest expense for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the  increase is due to an increase of  in average interest bearing liabilities as well as a basis point increase in cost of funds 
for the year ended december   there was  of interest expense on deposits including checking  money market and certificates of deposits as compared to  for the year ended december  the  net increase in interest expense on deposits was the result of an basis point increase in the average rate paid on deposits resulting in a positive  rate variance and a  positive volume variance 
for the year ended december   interest expense on other borrowed funds including short term debt  fhlb advances  and convertible subordinated debt was  compared to  for the  increase in interest expense related to other borrowed funds is the result of a basis point increase in the average cost of funds  offset  in part  by a decrease of  in the average outstanding balance 
the basis point increase in the average cost of other borrowed funds is primarily due to higher rates on short term debt 
during  the federal reserve increased short term borrowing rates  most notably the prime rate  several times 
these increases directly contributed to the company s increased cost of funds 
net interest income 
net interest income is determined by interest rate spread  which is the difference between the yields earned on interest earning assets and the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities  and the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income was  or of average interest earning assets for the year ended december   compared to  or  of average interest earning assets for the year ended december  the following table details the relative interest rates and average balances of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities for the years ended december   and average balance average yield rate interest variance attributable to variance rate volume interest earning assets short term investments investment securities loans held for sale loan and lease receivables total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities checking accounts money market certificates of deposit short term debt fhlb advances subordinated debt total interest bearing liabilities net interest margin interest free sources net interest income to interest earning assets based on amortized cost  changes in fair value are not considered 
no separate treatment has been made for non accrual loans 
variances attributable to the rate and volume mix are included in the volume variances 
provision for credit losses 
the provision for credit losses was  for the year ended december   compared to  for the decrease in provision relates to recording a  provision during for the company s aforementioned investment in leases originated by cmc 
excluding this provision for cmc  the provision expense was  for the year ended december  the increase in provision expense  excluding the cmc provision  relates to the  growth of loan and lease receivables 
additionally  during  we retained significant amounts of helocs as well as auto loans 
in  the company primarily retained first mortgages 
the shift in the types of products retained has contributed to increased provisions in reference is made to the heading financial condition asset quality and non performing assets above for additional details concerning the determination of provision expense related to maintaining the proper level of allowance for credit losses 
non interest income 
non interest income increased by  for the year ended december  compared to the same period of this increase was primarily driven by the  in recovery of msrs  off set in part by the  increase in amortization of msrs 
recovery of msrs increased due to the current performance of our investment in msrs  including lower than anticipated prepayment speeds and fluctuations in key market rates 
the increase in amortization expense is primarily a result of an increase in the underlying asset of  gain on sales of loans and msrs decreased by  comparing to this decrease can be attributed in part to decreased sales of billion or 
current period gain on sales of loans and msrs was also impacted by the need for increased provision for reserves under representations and warranties in response to recent increases in the frequency of losses on repurchased mortgage loans and a  additional provision discussed in note of the notes of the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
in addition  gain on sales of loans was driven down in part by strong competitive pressures within our non conforming channel 
non interest expense 
non interest expense includes all operating expenses such as salaries and benefits  marketing and general and administrative expenses 
non interest expense increased  or  for the year ended december  compared to the same period of this increase was primarily driven by an increase of  in marketing expense and  in depreciation and amortization 
marketing expense increased due to a few select campaigns that the company engaged in during the  increase in depreciation and amortization was a result of the accelerated leasehold improvements amortization due to the company moving its headquarters in additionally  increased amortization related to several intangible contracts acquired by the company s nps subsidiary 
in addition to the above increases  occupancy expense increased  non interest expense also increased due to the implementation of the quickpost initiative as well as increases in software maintenance expense

net interest income improved primarily because of the continuation of our strategy  begun in  to retain a higher portion of originated assets including mortgages  leases and auto loans 
net servicing results improved as a result of lower actual and projected prepayments in compared with the decrease in the provision for credit losses relates to the provision for losses on the company s investment in leases acquired from cmc of  recorded in the improvement in fees  charges and other income relates to the increase in transactional accounts ie  checking and money market year over year 
these improvements in earnings were offset  in part  by increases in operating expenses of  primarily relating to the growth in our auto lending and leasing operations  as well as the introduction of our quickpost initiative 
financial intermediary segment 
the following table highlights the financial intermediary segment s results of operations change net interest income gain on sales of loans other income net beacon credit services results net mg reinsurance results total revenues salary and employee benefits occupancy and depreciation expense other expenses total expenses pre tax loss income production sales total revenues to sales total expenses to production pre tax margin note the ratio of revenues to sales is based on mortgage banking sales  which includes inter segment sales to the retail banking segment 
the interest rate environment during the year ended december  was more favorable to mortgage production than the environment during in addition  the competitive environment the company operated in within  particularly within the company s non conforming operations  compressed margins severely 
the competitive pressures reduced revenue margins from basis points for the year ended december  to basis points for the year ended december  this decrease coupled with a decrease in net interest income resulted in a decrease in revenues of  expenses increased slightly by expenses in terms of basis points of production increased from basis points to basis points comparing the year ended december  to the year ended december  transaction processing segment 
the transaction processing segment provides atm and merchant processing services  subservices loans for the retail banking segment  financial intermediary segment and for third party customers  and sells various insurance products using an internet based platform 
the following table highlights the results of operations for the transaction processing segment change total revenue total expenses pre tax income the transaction processing segment reported an improvement in pre tax operating results of net insurance showed strong improvement moving from a loss of  in to a loss of in  an improvement of  nps added  of pre tax profit to the transaction processing segment s results during versus pre tax profit of  in other and eliminations segment 
for the year ended december   the other and eliminations segment recorded a pre tax loss of  compared to a pre tax loss of  for the same period of this amount represents netbank s holding company expenses and the elimination of intersegment revenues and expenses 
the elimination of intersegment revenues primarily consists of the deferral of gains associated with the sale of loans to the retail banking segment from the financial intermediary segment and loan servicing fees paid by the retail banking and financial intermediary segments to the transaction processing segment 
results of operations year ended december   compared to the year ended december  general 
net income for the year ended december  was  or per share  compared to net income of  or per share  for netbank s management capitalized on the favorable interest rate environment in to post strong revenues from its financial intermediary segment 
in contrast  rising interest rates and interest rate volatility during adversely impacted the results reported from the financial intermediary segment 
mortgage loan production within the financial intermediary segment dropped from billion to billion  while sales of mortgage loans dropped from billion to billion comparing to  respectively 
netbank also experienced pressure on its margins in the financial intermediary segment from increasing competition  especially in the correspondent channel 
the financial intermediary segment s pre tax income was down by million as a result 
this was offset  in part  by improved results in the retail banking segment which posted a pre tax loss of million during compared with a pre tax loss of million during included in the retail banking segment loss in was an additional provision for credit losses on the cmc leases of million 
in the absence of that provision  the retail banking segment would have reported pre tax earnings of million  an improvement of million over the prior year 
interest income 
netbank s interest income for the year ended december  was  compared to  in as detailed in the following rate volume variance table  we lowered the average balance of our loans held for sale by  and increased the average balance of investment securities available for sale and loan and lease receivables by  and  respectively 
this repositioning resulted in a positive volume variance of  due to the increase in average interest earning assets 
this was partially offset by a  negative variance due to lower yields 
the increase in loan and lease receivables is principally the result of the bank retaining originated loans and leases 
during  we retained  of internally originated mortgage loans primarily adjustable rate mortgages   of helocs   of internally originated auto loans and  of originated business finance loans and leases 
interest income was impacted for the years ended december  and by approximately million and million  respectively  due to the non accrual status of loans and leases 
interest expense 
total interest expense for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the  increase is due to an increase of  in interest bearing liabilities  offset  in part  by the impact of a basis point reduction in the average cost of funds 
for the year ended december   there was  of interest expense on deposits including checking  money market and certificates of deposits as compared to  for the year ended december  the  net decrease in interest expense on deposits was the result of a basis point decline in the average rate paid on deposits resulting in a positive  rate variance  offset in part by a volume variance of due to an increase in average interest bearing deposit balances of  for the year ended december   interest expense on other borrowed funds including short term debt  fhlb advances  and convertible subordinated debt was  compared to  for the  increase in interest expense related to other borrowed funds is the result of an increase of  in the average outstanding balance  offset  in part  by a basis point decline in the average cost of funds 
the basis point reduction in the average cost of other borrowed funds is primarily due to higher fixed rate term fhlb advances being prepaid during the second half of net interest income 
net interest income is determined by interest rate spread  which is the difference between the yields earned on interest earning assets and the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities  and the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income was  or of average interest earning assets for the year ended december   compared to  or  of average interest earning assets for the year ended december  the following table details the relative interest rates and average balances of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities for the years ended december   and average balance average yield rate interest variance attributable to variance rate volume interest earning assets short term investments investment securities loans held for sale loan and lease receivables total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities checking accounts money market certificates of deposit short term debt fhlb advances subordinated debt convertible subordinated debt total interest bearing liabilities net interest margin interest free sources net interest income to interest earning assets based on amortized cost  changes in fair value are not considered 
no separate treatment has been made for non accrual loans 
variances attributable to the rate and volume mix are included in the volume variances 
provision for credit losses 
the provision for credit losses was  for the year ended december   compared to  for the increase in provision relates to recording a  provision during the fourth quarter for the company s aforementioned investment in leases originated by cmc 
in november  two settlements in other cmc related cases were announced that were considered significant 
ameriana bancorp and lakeland bancorp both announced settlements with american motorist insurance company and royal indemnity  respectively 
based upon a review of publicly available information  these settlements appear to represent between and of the recorded receivable before allocated reserves 
netbank believes its case against the sureties is still very strong 
excluding this provision for cmc  the provision expense was  for the year ended december  compared with  for the year ended december  the reduction in provision expense  excluding the cmc provision  relates to a slowdown in the growth of loan and lease receivables 
during  loan and lease receivables grew by  compared with growth in of  reference is made to the heading financial condition asset quality and non performing assets above for additional detail concerning the determination of provision expense related to maintaining the proper level of allowance for credit losses 
non interest income 
non interest income declined by  for the year ended december  compared to the same period of this decline was primarily driven by the  decline in gain on sales of loans due to the billion or decline in sales of mortgage loans 
the decline in sales was compounded by the decline in margins on sales due to increased competitive pressures 
service charges and fees increased  as a result of an increase in the average number of loans serviced in compared with and inclusion of a full year of operating results of nps during  which was acquired on december  gain on sales of securities declined by  and gains on derivatives decreased by during the year ended december  compared with the same period in during  we were re balancing the durations of our asset liability mix  offsetting fees for prepayment of higher rate term debt with gains on the sale of selected securities available for sale 
during  we did not prepay any fhlb advances 
in  we began a program of hedging on the balance sheet  from an economic standpoint  a portion of the prepayment risk associated with our msrs 
that program involves acquiring mortgage backed securities by entering into to be announced tba trades and subsequently taking delivery of the resulting securities on respective agency settlement dates 
the tba trades prior to settlement are free standing derivatives that are marked to market 
in  this gave rise to the gains on derivatives 
likewise  we monetized a portion of our gain on some of the resulting mortgage backed securities available for sale giving rise to a total of million of gains on sale of securities 
other income increased by primarily due to lower hedge results driven by generally increasing mortgage interest rates and interest rate volatility compared to the same period of non interest expense 
non interest expense includes all operating expenses such as salaries and benefits  marketing and general and administrative expenses 
non interest expense decreased  for the year ended december  compared to the same period of this decline was primarily driven by reduced salaries and benefits expense of  related to reduced production volume in the financial intermediary segment   reduced prepayment fees on the early extinguishment of debt related to the extinguishment of term fhlb borrowings in  and a reduction in prepaid lost interest on curtailments of  related to reduced actual prepayments on loans serviced in compared with these decreases were offset  in part  by depreciation and amortization  occupancy and other expense categories that were generally higher as the our operations expanded period over period with the additions of netbank dealer financial services and nps 
retail banking segment 
the table below provides an overview of the results of operations for the retail banking segment change net interest income provision for credit losses net interest income after provision gain on sale of loans fees  charges and other income total revenues total expenses pre tax loss before net servicing results net servicing results pre tax loss earning assets average upb underlying msrs efficiencies to earning assets net interest income provision net interest income after provision gain on sale  fees  charges and other income banking revenues total expenses pre tax loss before net servicing results net servicing results to upb underlying msrs pre tax loss improved by  to  for the year ended december   compared with a pre tax loss of  for the same period in this is in spite of recording an additional provision for credit losses related to the company s investment in cmc leases 
in the absence of that charge  the improvement would have been  improvements in net interest income of  net servicing results of  net gain on securities and prepayment of debt of  and increases in fees  charges and other income of  resulted in the improvement year over year 
net interest income improved primarily because of the retention over the past two years of a higher portion of originated assets including mortgages  leases and auto loans 
likewise  during  the retail banking segment prepaid a large number of higher priced term fhlb advances and  through pricing  moved the mix of deposits from higher cost certificates of deposit to lower cost money market and checking accounts 
these asset liability strategies have improved net interest income as a percentage of earning assets by to for the year ended december  compared with for the same period in net servicing results improved as a result of lower actual and projected prepayments in compared with the increase in the provision for credit losses relates to the aforementioned provision for losses on the company s investment in leases acquired from cmc 
the improvement in fees  charges and other income relates to the increase in transactional accounts ie  checking and money market year over year 
these improvements in earnings were offset  in part  by increases in operating expenses of  primarily related to the growth in our auto lending operation 
financial intermediary segment 
the following table highlights the financial intermediary segment production and sales activities change net interest income gain on sales of loans other income net beacon credit services results net mg reinsurance results total revenues salary and employee benefits occupancy and depreciation expense other expenses total expenses pre tax income production sales total revenues to sales total expenses to production pre tax margin note the ratio of revenues to sales is based on mortgage banking sales  which includes inter segment sales to the retail banking segment 
the interest rate environment during the year ended december  was much more favorable to mortgage loan production than the environment during in  mortgage loan rates were hitting historic lows 
the loan pipelines of originators throughout the mortgage banking industry were filled  resulting in less pressure on margins 
during the latter part of and continuing into  mortgage loan rates rose  and competitive pressures heated up as pipeline volumes decreased 
this margin pressure was especially true in the correspondent channel 
this resulted in a decrease in mortgage loan production of billion and a decrease in sales of billion 
the competitive pressures reduced revenue margins from basis points for the year ended december  to basis points for the year ended december  as a result  revenues decreased  expenses decreased  expenses in terms of basis points of production increased from basis points to basis points comparing the year ended december  to the year ended december  this was the result of less leverage of fixed expenses during transaction processing segment 
the transaction processing segment provides atm and merchant processing services  subservices loans for the retail banking segment  financial intermediary segment and for third party customers  and sells various insurance products using an internet based platform 
the following table highlights the results of operations for the transaction processing segment change total revenues total expenses pre tax income loss the transaction processing segment reported an improvement in pre tax operating results of  the servicing operations showed improved results related primarily to improved expense control and an increase in the average number of loans serviced when comparing with nps  acquired late in the fourth quarter of  added  of pre tax profit to the transaction processing segment s results during other and eliminations segment 
for the year ended december   the other and eliminations segment recorded a pre tax loss of  compared to a pre tax loss of  for the same period of this amount represents netbank s holding company expenses and the elimination of intersegment revenues and expenses 
the elimination of intersegment revenues primarily consists of the deferral of gains associated with the sale of loans to the retail banking segment from the financial intermediary segment and loan servicing fees paid by the retail banking and financial intermediary segments to the transaction processing segment 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity 
netbank s liquidity  represented by cash and cash equivalents  is a product of its operating  investing  and financing activities 
our primary sources of funds are deposits  borrowings  prepayments and maturities of outstanding loans  sales of loans  maturities of investment securities and other short term investments  and funds provided from operations 
while scheduled loan payments and maturing investment securities and short term investments are relatively predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions  and competition 
we can use cash generated through the retail deposit market  our traditional funding source  to offset the cash utilized in investing activities 
our available for sale securities and short term interest earning assets can also be used to provide liquidity for lending and other operational requirements 
net cash outflow for was compared to a net cash inflow of  for the decrease in net cash flow for was primarily due to the proceeds from sales of loans held for sale decreasing  to  in addition  cash outflow for the origination of loans held for sale also increased  to  as an additional source of funds  netbank  inc had available under existing lines of credit agreements billion at december  reference is made to note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional details regarding our available lines of credit 
we use deposits as our principal source of funds 
during compared to  deposits increased by million to billion from billion as of december  our deposit products include checking  money market and certificates of deposit accounts 
deposit account terms vary  with the principal differences being the minimum balance required  the time periods the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate 
we are competitive in the types of accounts  services and ranges of interest rates offered on deposit products 
although market demand generally dictates which deposit maturities and rates will be accepted by the public  we intend to continue to promote checking  money market and certificates of deposit to the extent possible consistent with asset and liability management goals 
capital resources 
netbank and netbank  fsb are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies  including the office of thrift supervision the ots 
failure of either company to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  netbank  fsb must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of netbank  fsb s assets  liabilities  and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
netbank  fsb s capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the ots about components  risk weightings and other factors 
under current regulatory guidelines  netbank  fsb may not make a capital distribution to the company without prior approval of the ots 
current guidelines require  among other things  that netbank  fsb not make an unapproved capital distribution in excess of its current period year to date undistributed earnings plus the preceding two years undistributed earnings and in no event make a distribution which would cause netbank  fsb to be less than adequately capitalized as defined below 
quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require netbank  fsb to maintain minimum amounts and ratios as set forth in the following table 
the ots requires netbank  fsb to maintain minimum ratios of tangible capital to tangible assets of  core capital to tangible assets of and total capital to risk weighted assets of 
the following table presents information related to netbank  fsb along with capital requirements mandated by the ots actual for capital adequacy purposes to be categorized as well capitalized amount ratio amount ratio amount ratio december  total capital to risk weighted assets core capital to adjusted total assets tangible capital to adjusted total assets n a n a tier i capital to risk weighted assets n a n a december  total capital to risk weighted assets core capital to adjusted total assets tangible capital to adjusted total assets n a n a tier i capital to risk weighted assets n a n a in addition  netbank s subsidiaries engaged in mortgage banking must adhere to various hud regulatory guidelines including required minimum net worth to maintain their fha approved lending status 
failure to comply with the hud guidelines could result in withdrawal of this certification 
as of december   market street and meritage were in compliance with hud guidelines 
netbank and its subsidiaries are subject to various other capital requirements by secondary market investors and states 
none of these capital requirements are more stringent than the ots capital requirements 
failure to comply with these restrictions could have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations 
all of the capital requirements placed upon netbank and its subsidiaries were met as of december  item a 
quantative and qualitative disclosures about market risk netbank s principal businesses are retail banking and the origination and purchase of mortgage loans 
these businesses are funded by customer deposits and  to the extent necessary  other borrowed funds 
consequently  a significant portion of netbank s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature and fluctuations in interest rates will affect netbank s future net interest income and cash flows 
this interest rate risk is netbank s primary market risk exposure 
for the year ended december   the only derivative financial instruments that netbank entered into were associated with hedging activities related to the portfolio of mortgage loans held for sale  the pipeline of mortgage loans for which the interest rate has been locked  hedging the securitization and sale of portfolio loans  the owned mortgage servicing rights portfolio and the mortgage servicing rights which netbank intends to retain associated with the pipeline of mortgage loans for which the interest rate has already been locked 
our exposure to market risk is reviewed on a regular basis by management 
the following table shows the carrying values and fair values of our portfolio of assets and liabilities as of december  if interest rates were to increase decrease increase decrease carrying estimated basis points basis points amount fair value estimated fair value estimated fair value assets cash and cash equivalents investment securities available for sale mortgage loans held for sale mandatory delivery commitments mortgage loan purchase commitments loan and lease receivables net of allowance for credit losses mortgage servicing rights swaps  swaptions  caps  floors and forward purchase commitments hedging mortgage servicing rights available for sale total interest rate sensitive assets non interest rate sensitive assets total assets liabilities non interest bearing deposits interest bearing deposits interest bearing certificates of deposit short term borrowings long term borrowings subordinated debt total interest rate sensitive liabilities non interest rate sensitive liabilities total liabilities minority interest shareholders equity total liabilities  minority interest and shareholders equity fair values of financial assets and liabilities are estimated using several methods 
the first method is by use of directly observable market prices 
this method applies to most of the loans held for sale and investment securities available for sale which trade in highly liquid markets 
a second method employs the use of market benchmarks 
in this method  a benchmark financial asset or liability is selected which matches many of the characteristics of the financial instrument being evaluated 
the instrument being evaluated is then priced at a spread relative to the benchmark instrument 
this method applies to many loan and lease receivables 
a third method used to estimate the fair value of an instrument employs approximating a spread over a readily available market index or yield curve 
this method is used where no directly observable market exists and no suitable benchmark instrument can be found 
many deposit accounts are evaluated in this manner 
based on these fair value estimates  the data indicates that the net value of assets and liabilities exceeds that of their associated carry value 
most of this excess value is derived from the origination of interest bearing deposits 
additionally  the table shows the exposure of the portfolio to theoretical instantaneous and parallel changes in market interest rates of and basis points 
these simulated values are created using complex financial models which incorporate many assumptions 
prudent balance sheet management dictates that changes in value for one instrument should be offset to some extent by another balance sheet instrument 
for example  the largest single component of market exposure is loan and lease receivables 
this category declines in theoretical value by million for a basis point increase in rates 
this exposure is mitigated by the duration of interest bearing deposits having offsetting exposure of million  and interest bearing certificates of deposit with offsetting exposure of million 
while most of the risk is balanced out in this manner  the data suggests that the company benefits in a decline in market interest rates  versus a rise in interest rates 
this is commonly referred to as a liability sensitive position 
management carefully manages the exposure to these scenario simulations and many others  which are intended to be broadly representative of the likely future path of interest rates 
in examining the table presented above  one point that is worth consideration  as a simplifying assumption  this analysis assumes that risk exposure is passively rather than actively managed  in other words  management does not attempt to alter the balance sheet position to changing market levels 
in practice  management closely monitors market exposure levels and actively manages the position 
reference is made to note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional details regarding the valuation of netbank s market and interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
netbank  fsb  like other savings banks  measures interest rate risk based on net portfolio value npv analysis 
npv equals the present value of expected net cash flows from existing assets minus the present value of expected net cash flows from existing liabilities 
a npv ratio is determined by dividing npv by the present value of assets 
the following table sets forth the estimated netbank  fsb npv ratios as of december  and december  assuming rate shocks of to basis points limits and current npv ratios for netbank  fsb rate shock in basis points as of december  as of december  minimum as of december  flat minimum ratios for npv risk are established by our board of directors as prudent levels for the respective interest scenarios 
lower npv ratios denote more market rate sensitivity for a given rate scenario 
as of december   the analysis indicates sensitivity to rising market interest rates 
this sensitivity is  however  well within the board approved limits for these scenarios 
computation of prospective effects of hypothetical rate changes is based on many assumptions  including relative levels of market interest rates  loan prepayments and deposit decay 
they should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
further  the computations do not contemplate certain actions management could undertake in response to changes in interest rates
