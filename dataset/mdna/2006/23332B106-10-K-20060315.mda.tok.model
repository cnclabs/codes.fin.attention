item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis is intended to provide an investor with a narrative of our financial results and an evaluation of our financial condition and results of operations 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
overview our business model is relatively straightforward 
dsp group is a fabless semiconductor company that is a leader in providing chipsets to telephone equipment and design manufacturers oems and odms for incorporation into consumer products for the residential wireless telecommunication market 
our chipsets incorporate advanced technologies  such as dsp processors  communications technologies  highly advanced radio frequency rf devices and in house developed voice over internet protocol voip hardware and software technologies 
our products include ghz digital enhanced cordless telephony dect  ghz and ghz chipsets for cordless telephones  bluetooth for voice  data and video communication  solutions for digital voice recorders and voip and other voice over packet applications 
our current primary focus is cordless telephony with sales of our ghz and ghz chipsets representing approximately of our total revenues for over recent years we have become a worldwide leader in developing and marketing total telephony solutions for the wireless residential market 
we believe we were able to capture the residential wireless telephony market and increase our market share and customer base by taking advantage of the market transformation from analog based to digital based technologies for telephony products  the earlier shift from mhz to ghz technologies  and the recent shift from ghz to ghz technologies 
our focus on the convergence of these trends has allowed us to offer products with more features  and better range  security and voice quality 
another factor that contributed to our growth in recent years is our focus on new emerging markets such as the japanese domestic market  korea and south america 
additional factors that contributed significantly to our revenue growth over the past few years are the market acceptance of our multi handset solutions for cordless telephony  as well as our other pioneer features 
however  we need to penetrate new markets and introduce new products to further expand our business 
in that regard  the most important step we have taken is the decision to penetrate the dect market 
we introduced our first dect products for the european market in  and currently have three customers incorporating our products in nine consumer brands 
our future growth is dependent on our success in expanding our presence in the european dect market and the general market deployment and acceptance of our dect products 
in our revenues grew by in comparison to  reaching a record level of million in sales 
the main drivers of this growth were increased sales of our ghz products  and our penetration of the dect and the japanese domestic markets 
our gross profit decreased to a level of in from in  mainly as a result of increased assembly and testing expenses 
operating expenses increased by in compared to  reaching a level of million 
the increase in operating expenses was mainly due to a increase in our research and development expenses in as compared to our operating profit was million in  approximately of revenues  compared to million in  representing of revenues 
as of december   our principal source of liquidity consisted of cash and cash equivalents totaling approximately million  short term investments of million and marketable securities of approximately million  totaling to million 
however  our business operates in a highly competitive environment 
competition has historically increased pricing pressures for our products and decreased our average selling prices 
in order to penetrate new markets and maintain our market share with our existing products  we may need to offer our products in the future at lower prices which may result in lower profits 
our future growth is dependent not only on the continued success of our existing products but also the successful introduction of new products 
moreover  we must continue to 
table of contents monitor and control our operating costs and our gross margins in order to offset future declines in average selling prices 
in addition  as we are a fabless semiconductor company  global market trends such as over capacity problems shortage of capacity to meet our fabrication  testing and assembly needs may increase our raw material and production costs and thus decrease our gross margins 
also  since our products are incorporated into end products of original equipment manufacturer oem customers  our business is very dependent on their ability to introduce products that achieve market acceptance in consumer electronic markets  which are equally competitive 
there are also several emerging market trends that challenge our continued business growth potential 
we believe that new developments in the home residential market may adversely affect our operating results 
for example  the rapid deployment of new communication access methods  including mobile  wireless broadband  cable and other connectivity  as well as the projected lack of growth in products using fixed line telephony  may reduce our revenues derived from  and unit sales of  cordless telephony products  which are currently our primary focus 
our business may also be affected by the outcome of the current competition between cellular phone operators and fixed line operators for the provision of residential communication 
our revenues are currently primarily generated from sales of chipsets used in cordless phones that are based on fixed line telephony 
as a result  a decline in the use of fixed line telephony for residential communication would adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 
one additional factor that could affect the results of our operations is the potential shift in the us digital telephony market towards dect products as the federal communications commission fcc has authorized the use of the dect frequency band in the us the us market is currently the dominant market of our customers 
an increase in demand for dect products in the us and our inability to successfully develop and market new dect products to address this market may have a material adverse effect on our profits and results of operation 
we are taking several steps to address the new challenges and market trends 
first  we are introducing new features into our existing products and are penetrating additional markets  including china  korea  south america and the domestic japanese market  with our existing products 
the new features include a cellular cradle to extend the cellular coverage throughout the residence by turning the cellular phone into an extra line of the cordless system  a universal serial bus usb dongle to connect the residential handsets to the public network using internet protocol through personal computers  and other pioneer features such as polyphonic ringer 
we also have developed technology that allows our customers to add a visual dimension to telephone based systems 
in our customers introduced the first line of products that incorporate this technology  which products enable security surveillance and baby monitoring  and will enable video communication over pstn lines in models 
we believe that these pioneer solutions will allow us to provide the desired flexibility for residential users 
we cannot provide any assurances  however  that these new features will achieve market acceptance  and allow us to maintain our market share or provide for our future growth 
in addition  our long term goal is to leverage the wi fi technology acquired in from bermai to develop and offer products for home communication in future years 
we believe the strategic acquisitions we made in and of various video and wi fi technologies will enable us to integrate voice  data and video technologies with broadband offerings and prepare us for the dynamic and evolving nature of the short range multimedia communication and home wireless markets 
we believe that our current products  including ghz products  the new features being added to our existing products  the continued shift from analog to digital products  the increase of market share of our oem customers in existing and new markets and the penetration of new markets with our dect products will drive our growth in we expect that products for home communication  including wi fi products  will start contributing to our revenues in and beyond 
however  our ability to introduce new products and expand into new markets may not occur and may require us to substantially increase our operating expenses 
as a result  our past operating results should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance
