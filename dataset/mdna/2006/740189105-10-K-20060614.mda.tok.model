item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business overview precision castparts corp 
pcc or the company completed another successful year in fiscal  attaining record levels of sales  operating income  net income and earnings per share 
these results reflected continuing strong conditions in the company s core aerospace and power generation markets  which were driven by increased oem build rates  significant market share gains and strong aftermarket sales 
the company also benefited from continuing cost reductions and operational improvements across most of its businesses 
during the year  the company executed on key acquisition strategies to strengthen its market positions and achieve profitable growth well into the future 
in the fastener products segment  aerospace operations were bolstered by a full year of sales from air industries corporation aic  which was acquired in late march  and from the acquisition of the shur lok group in january these companies greatly expanded the manufacturing capabilities and range of products that the fastener products segment offers to its commercial airframe customers  and they helped to counteract the impact of sluggish conditions in the automotive sector by propelling the segment to operating margins in excess of percent for the year 
in may  approximately two months into fiscal  the company received the necessary regulatory approvals and was able to complete the acquisition of special metals corporation smc  a world leader in the production of high performance nickel based alloys and super alloys 
with annual sales in excess of billion  smc will provide the company with near term and long term opportunities for profitable growth and significant value creation 
as with past acquisitions  pcc will aggressively drive operational efficiencies through smc with the same vigor and intensity that it gives to its current businesses 
in addition to growth coming from the acquisition of smc  the company expects oem build rates will continue to increase in both the aerospace and power generation markets during fiscal  combined with continued market share gains and strong aftermarket sales 
pcc has positioned itself on the right platforms  and is currently developing products for new generation aircraft programs  such as the airbus a  the boeing  and the jsf and f military aircraft  and expect to have similar opportunities on projects like the airbus a to handle the additional demand for aerospace products  the company plans to increase manufacturing capacity during fiscal in addition  the company expects sales of seamless extruded pipe will increase greater than percent in fiscal  principally driven by increasing demand from the growing power generation market in asia 
pcc believes there continues to be abundant opportunities for further cost reductions and operational efficiencies in every one of its businesses 
the realization of these cost improvements  combined with leverage from increasing sales volume  will drive expected margin improvements and value creation in fiscal

the aggregate purchase price was million  which included million of cash  pcc common stock valued at million and million of cash paid for transaction fees 
in addition  sps paid million for change of control payments and transaction fees as of the close of the transaction 
the value of the million shares of pcc common stock issued in connection with the acquisition was determined based on the quoted market price of pcc s common stock on and around the date of the close of the transaction 

table of contents sps is a supplier of fasteners and other metal products to the aerospace  automotive  and general industrial markets 
sps former specialty materials and alloys group now operates as part of the investment cast products segment 
a new segment  fastener products  was established and comprises sps former aerospace fasteners and engineered fasteners groups 
sps former tool group now operates as part of the industrial products segment 
in addition  three former sps businesses dacar  which was sold in the third quarter of fiscal  magnetics  which was sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal and mohawk  which was sold in the first quarter of fiscal were classified as held for sale in the third quarter of fiscal  and their results were included in discontinued operations until their disposition 
discontinued operations the company s financial statements were significantly impacted by activities relating to the planned divestiture of a number of pcc s businesses 
these businesses have been accounted for under sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
accordingly  any operating results of these businesses are presented in the company s consolidated statements of operations as discontinued operations  net of income tax  and all prior periods have been reclassified 
fiscal in the second quarter of fiscal  the company made the decision to sell all of the pumps and valves businesses of pcc flow technologies  with the exception of e one and pcc eurovalves 
the businesses held for sale were reclassified from the fluid management products segment to discontinued operations 
the e one business was retained and is now included in the industrial products segment 
the sale of the pumps and valves businesses of pcc flow technologies was completed in the third quarter of fiscal  and pcc eurovalves  which is located in the netherlands  was sold in the third quarter of fiscal pcc s decision to sell the pumps and valves businesses in the second quarter of fiscal resulted in a charge of million  of which million was associated with the write down of goodwill 
the remainder of the charge related to the write down of inventory  other amortizable assets and machinery and equipment to fair value less cost to sell 
approximately million of the charge was non cash 
subsequent to the second quarter of fiscal  the company recorded additional write downs related to the disposition of the pumps and valves businesses  bringing the total net loss on disposal to million through april  fiscal in the third quarter of fiscal  three businesses acquired in the sps transaction magnetics  mohawk  and dacar were classified as held for sale and their results were included in discontinued operations 
they were classified as discontinued operations because they were deemed to be non core to the company 
dacar was sold in the third quarter of fiscal  magnetics was sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and mohawk was sold in the first quarter of fiscal in the second quarter of fiscal  the company incurred asset impairment and disposal charges associated with its decision to sell newmans  a valve distribution company of pcc flow technologies 
it was determined that newmans distribution business did not fit with pcc s manufacturing focused operations and was not performing to the company s expectations 
the company s decision to sell newmans resulted in a charge of million  principally related to the write down of assets to net realizable value 
the newmans business was sold in the third quarter of fiscal 
table of contents restructuring  asset impairment and other non recurring charges the following table provides significant components of amounts recorded in the consolidated statements of operations related to the company s restructuring and asset impairment charges 
fiscal provision for restructuring severance other impairment of long lived assets total fiscal during the third quarter of fiscal  pcc recorded restructuring and asset impairment charges of million  which included million primarily due to the write down of a building and equipment to fair value related to consolidation of a machining operation in the investment cast products segment and million for severance costs associated with headcount reductions related to downsizing the company s tooling operation in ireland 
the tax effected impact of these charges was million  or per share diluted 
taking into consideration current and forecasted conditions in markets served by the company  pcc regularly assesses its cost structure to ensure that operations are properly sized for prevailing market conditions 
based on the company s most recent assessment  there are no current plans to restructure operations in fiscal other expense other expense of million was recorded in the third quarter of fiscal to reflect the write off of unamortized bank fees million from early termination of bank credit facilities and the termination of an interest rate swap million associated with debt refinancing  both in connection with the sps acquisition 
special investigation in september and october  the company received three related reports with respect to concerns about employee misconduct and the proper application of generally accepted accounting principles gaap to certain transactions at the wyman gordon forgings houston plant  a business unit reported in the forged products segment 
the matters identified in the reports were referred to the audit committee of the board of directors audit committee 
the audit committee  after due consideration  decided to commence an independent investigation 
in november  the audit committee expanded the scope of the investigation to review two similar but unrelated reports alleging employee misconduct and improper application of gaap at j l fiber services  inc  a business unit reported in the industrial products segment 
in february  the audit committee completed its independent investigation and determined that the company accounted for certain transactions incorrectly at both identified locations  as described below the investigation at wyman gordon forgings houston identified errors in the company s financial statements from fiscal through the first quarter of fiscal these errors  which totaled million  represented a net overstatement of expenses through the first quarter of fiscal the errors 
table of contents primarily related to the failure to properly reconcile accounts and the misapplication of gaap and company accounting policies 
there were also timing errors related to the improper recognition of revenue within fiscal of million and between the fourth quarter of fiscal and the first quarter of fiscal of million 
the identified errors resulted from both deliberate and inadvertent acts involving non executive employees 
the investigation at j l fiber services  inc identified errors in the company s financial statements from fiscal through the first quarter of fiscal these errors  which totaled million  represented a net understatement of expenses through the first quarter of fiscal the errors primarily related to the overstatement of inventories resulting from the failure to properly record excess and obsolete reserves and inadequate cycle counting procedures  the failure to properly reconcile accounts  and the misapplication of gaap and company accounting policies  which included improper deferral of expenses 
the identified errors resulted from both deliberate and inadvertent acts involving non executive employees 
the company s management concluded  with the concurrence of the audit committee  that the impact of these errors was not material to the company s consolidated financial statements for any interim or annual period in which the errors were found 
in reaching this conclusion  the company reviewed and analyzed the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 materiality  accounting principles board opinion no 
 interim financial reporting  paragraph and sab topic f  accounting changes not retroactively applied due to immateriality  in order to determine that the misstatements were not material on a quantitative or qualitative basis 
as a result  the company recorded a cumulative adjustment in the second quarter of fiscal the net impact of these corrections was a decrease to pre tax income and net income of million and million or per share diluted  respectively  in fiscal the company took immediate action to address the cause of these errors  including termination of certain individuals  the development of improved policies and procedures  and enhancement of internal controls 
in addition  high level reviews at nine additional locations were performed as part of the independent investigation 
the findings did not result in identification of any issues that required further investigation 
management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of its internal controls in relation to these findings 
based on management s review and analysis  it was concluded that the control deficiencies that resulted in the errors to the prior period financial statements discussed above were not independently material weaknesses and that when aggregated with other deficiencies also did not constitute a material weakness in the company s internal control over financial reporting 
outlook the company expects that the aerospace and power generation markets will continue to strengthen in fiscal as commercial aircraft build rates and large frame oem industrial gas turbine deliveries increase 
the momentum in aftermarket demand and market share gains is also expected to continue 
with the acquisition of smc  pcc expects some shift in its product mix  with approximately percent of sales going to the aerospace market versus percent last year and approximately percent of sales going to general industrial markets versus percent last year 
pcc s base general industrial markets are also expected to grow due to increases in non aerospace military programs such as the howitzer armament program and other land and marine based ordnance programs 
overall  base business sales are expected to approximate market growth for the aerospace  power generation and automotive markets  and approximate gdp for other markets 
the acquisition of smc is expected to increase fiscal sales by more than percent over fiscal levels 

table of contents operating earnings are expected to benefit from the sales volume increases from the base businesses  continued operating improvements  and months of sales from smc 
operating margins of the company s base business  as a percent of sales  is also expected to show improvement over fiscal levels principally due to leverage from higher sales volume and improved operating performance  partially offset by the dilutive impact of increased material pass through pricing and the impact of expensing stock options 
operating margins will also be diluted by the addition of smc  which has lower operating margins than the company s base business 
financial results by segment pcc has organized the company s business segments along its four major product lines and reports financial results in the following four segments investment cast products  forged products  fastener products and industrial products

the sales increase reflects the addition of sales from sps tool group  market share gains in the automotive industry  and improved conditions in the aerospace and pulp and paper markets 
operating income as a percent of sales benefited from the higher volume and increased production at low cost manufacturing facilities in hungary and india  partially offset by the impact of adding the sps businesses  which have lower operating margins 
interest and taxes net interest expense in fiscal was million  as compared with million in fiscal the lower interest expense is primarily due to reduced debt levels  partially offset by higher interest rates compared to fiscal the effective tax rate for fiscal was percent  compared with percent in fiscal the lower tax rate in fiscal was principally due to a one time tax benefit in the third quarter of million  revisions in estimates of the extraterritorial income exclusion tax benefit for fiscal and increased earnings in foreign jurisdictions that have lower income tax rates compared with the united states 
liquidity and capital resources total assets of  million at april  represented a million increase from the  million balance at april   reflecting reduced cash balances  partially offset by the acquisition of shur lok  and higher inventory and accounts receivable balances to support improved business conditions 
total capitalization at april   was  million  consisting of million of debt and  million of equity 
the debt to capitalization ratio improved to at april  from at the end of fiscal cash as of april  was million  down million from the end of fiscal  and total debt was million  down million since the end of fiscal in addition to the million of net debt payments  cash requirements for the year included million of pension contributions million were voluntary  million for the acquisition of shur lok  million for capital expenditures  million for increased working capital and million for dividends

the company also has benefit payments due under its non qualified pension and other post retirement benefit plans that are not required to be funded in advance  but are pay as you go 
see the pension and other postretirement benefit plans footnote to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
critical accounting policies the company has identified the policies below as critical to pcc s business operations and the understanding of its results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on pcc s business operations are discussed throughout the management s discussion and analysis where such policies affect reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other significant accounting policies  see the notes to the consolidated financial statements of this annual report 
note that the preparation of this annual report requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when the earnings process is complete 
this generally occurs when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with the contract or purchase order  ownership and risk of loss have passed to the customer  collectibility is reasonably assured  and pricing is fixed and determinable 
in instances where title does not pass to the customer upon shipment  the company recognizes revenue upon delivery or customer acceptance  depending on terms of the sales agreement 
service sales  representing aftermarket repair and maintenance and engineering activities  are recognized as services are performed 
shipping and handling costs billed to customers are included in revenue 
accounts receivable reserve the company evaluates the collectibility of its accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where pcc is aware of a customer s inability to meet its financial obligations 
table of contents eg  bankruptcy filings  a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due is recorded to reduce the receivable to the amount the company reasonably expects will be collected 
in addition  the company records reserves for bad debts based on other quantitative measures  which include the analysis of historical write offs and the age of outstanding receivables 
the establishment of reserves requires the use of judgment and assumptions regarding the potential for losses on receivable balances 
although the company considers these balances adequate and proper  changes in economic conditions in the markets in which the company operates could have a material effect on the required reserve balances 
valuation of inventories all inventories are stated at the lower of the cost to purchase or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
cost for work in process and metal inventories at a significant number of the company s operations is determined on a last in  first out lifo basis 
the average inventory cost method is utilized for most other inventories 
the company regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess or obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based on the age  historical usage or assumptions about future demand for the inventory 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required  which could have a significant impact on the value of pcc s inventories and reported operating results 
goodwill and acquired intangibles from time to time  the company acquires businesses in purchase transactions that typically result in the recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets  which may affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment charges 
the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the consolidated financial statements 
environmental costs the estimated future costs for known environmental remediation requirements are accrued on an undiscounted basis when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of remediation costs can be reasonably estimated 
when only a range of amounts is established  and no amount within the range is better than another  the minimum amount of the range is recorded 
recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties are recorded as assets when collection is probable 
adjustments to the company s accruals may be necessary to reflect new information as investigation and remediation efforts proceed 
the amounts of any such adjustments could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations in a given period  but the amounts  and the possible range of loss in excess of the amounts accrued  are not reasonably estimable 
total environmental reserves accrued at april  and april  were million and million  respectively 
the amounts accrued relate to estimated liabilities at multiple locations  with the most significant potential liability associated with the wyman gordon facility in north grafton  massachusetts 
income taxes provisions for federal  state and foreign income taxes are calculated on reported pre tax earnings based on current tax law and also include  in the current period  the cumulative effect of any changes in tax rates from those used previously in determining deferred tax assets and liabilities 
such provisions differ from the amounts currently receivable or payable because certain items of income and expense are recognized in different time periods for financial reporting purposes than for income tax purposes 
significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and evaluating tax positions 
valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized
