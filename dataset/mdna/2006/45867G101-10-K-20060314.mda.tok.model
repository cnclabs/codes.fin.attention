item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data  the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto  contained in this document 
please refer to the glossary of terms immediately following the table of contents for a listing and detailed description of the various technical  industry and other defined terms that are used in this form k 
business we design and develop advanced digital wireless technologies which we make available for license to semiconductor companies  handset manufacturers and other equipment producers 
our technology offerings include patented inventions  know how and other technical data eg  software  designs and specifications related to the design and operation of digital wireless products and systems 
we have built our suite of offerings through independent development  joint development with other companies and selected acquisitions 
we actively participate in the standard setting process for digital wireless technologies  both cellular and non cellular  contributing solutions that are regularly incorporated into the standards 
to date  the majority of our revenue has been derived from companies with which we have patent license agreements covering the manufacture and sale of g and g mobile terminal units and or infrastructure products 
our goal is to derive revenue on every g mobile terminal unit sold 
as of march  we have received royalties on approximately of all g mobile terminal units sold worldwide 
royalties from companies with patent license agreements covering their sales of g and g handsets and infrastructure products generate a significant portion of our cash flow and revenues 
we also generate revenues and cash flow by licensing technology solutions eg  hsdpa  wcdma terminal unit protocol stack software  physical layer designs  etc 
and the provision of specialized engineering services 
over the last three years  we have signed fourteen new or amended patent license agreements with both new and existing customers  including ten license agreements covering g technologies 
over the same period  quarterly recurring patent license royalties have more than doubled  from million in first quarter to million in fourth quarter this increase resulted from both an increase in the number of licensees and higher royalties from existing licensees  based on increased sales of covered g and g products 
in  of our recurring patent license royalties were generated from patent license agreements that included g standards compliant products 
due to anticipated growth in g product sales  we expect that our g g royalty mix will continue to shift to a higher percentage of g royalties as the decade unfolds 
new material patent license agreement on january   we entered into a worldwide  non transferable  non exclusive  patent license agreement with lg electronics inc lg 
the five year patent license agreement  effective january   covers the sale  both prior to january  and during the five year term  of terminal units compliant with all tdma based second generation g standards including tia  gsm  gprs  and edge and all third generation g standards including wcdma  td scdma and cdma technology and its extensions  and infrastructure products compliant with cdma technology and its extensions  up to a limited threshold amount  under all patents owned by us prior to and during the term of the license 
at the end of the five year term  lg will receive a paid up license to sell single mode gsm gprs edge terminal units under the patents included in the patent license agreement 
under the terms of the patent license agreement  lg paid us the first of three equal installments of million in first quarter the remaining two installments are due in the first quarters of and  respectively 
we are recognizing the revenue associated with this agreement on a straight line basis from its inception through december  expiring g patent license and technology solutions revenue the amortization of million of royalty payments associated with our g patent license agreement with nec corporation of japan nec was completed in february telefonaktiebolaget lm ericsson and ericsson inc ericsson and sony ericsson mobile communications ab sony ericsson obligations to pay royalties under their respective g g patent license agreements will end on december  we will recognize revenue related to ericsson million per quarter and sony ericsson based on reported sales of covered product through december  and march   respectively 
together  these three licensees contributed approximately million or of our revenue in in addition  on december   we completed amortization of deferred revenue related to other g agreements  which collectively  contributed million or of our revenue in through december   we also recognized million of the million related to our deliverables under the mobile user objective system muos program for the us military pursuant to our agreement with general dynamics c systems formerly known as  general dynamics decision systems  inc general dynamics 
we expect to recognize an additional million in related to final deliverables and will amortize the million related to maintenance services under that agreement over a three year period beginning january  we continue to place substantial focus on both expanding our base of patent licensees and resolving outstanding patent license arbitrations and litigations 
we also continue to seek customers for our technology solutions 
as a result  we concluded a number of agreements over the last twelve months that will contribute revenue that will more than offset the reductions noted above 
for example  as discussed above  in first quarter  we signed a g g patent license agreement with lg and in third quarter we signed a g patent license agreement with kyocera wireless corporation  and its parent corporation  kyocera corporation  collectively  kyocera  which covers the sale of terminal units compliant with cdma technologies and its extensions 
these two agreements will contribute approximately million in revenue in in addition  in we also signed g g patent license agreements with arima communications  quanta computer inc  and lucent technologies inc 
lucent  as well as technology solutions agreements with philips semiconductors bv philips and infineon technologies ag infineon that will provide revenue contributions in repurchase of common stock on march   our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our outstanding common stock through open market purchases  pre arranged trading plans or privately negotiated purchases 
under previous repurchase programs in  and  we repurchased million  million and million shares of common stock for million  million and million  respectively 
intellectual property rights enforcement from time to time  if we believe that a third party is required to license our patents in order to manufacture and sell certain digital cellular products and such third party has not done so  we might institute legal action against the third party 
these legal actions typically take the form of a patent infringement lawsuit 
in addition  we and our licensees  in the normal course of business  might seek to resolve disagreements between the parties with respect to the rights and obligations of the parties under the applicable license agreement through arbitration or litigation 
in  our patent administration and licensing costs increased million  principally due to a million increase in patent enforcement costs 
these costs relate to an arbitration with nokia corporation nokia that concluded in  litigation with nokia that remains outstanding  litigation with lucent that was settled in and preparation for an arbitration with samsung that took place in january enforcement costs will likely continue to be a significant expense for us 
development our investments in the development of advanced digital wireless technologies and related products include sustaining a highly specialized engineering team and providing that team with the equipment and advanced software platforms necessary to support the development of technologies 
over each of the last three years  our cost of development has ranged between and of our total operating expenses 
the largest portion of our cost of development has been personnel costs 
as of december   we employed engineers  of whom hold advanced degrees  of whom hold phds 
taxes in  we determined that our current expectations to generate future taxable income indicated that it was more likely than not that we would utilize our remaining federal deferred tax assets 
accordingly  in fourth quarter  we recognized an increase in the value of our deferred tax assets of approximately million through a reversal of the valuation allowance previously held against our federal deferred tax assets 
of the million benefit  million was recognized as income in our statement of operations and million was credited directly to additional paid in capital 
in addition  we increased the value of our deferred tax assets by million as a result of a change in the estimated tax rate we expect will apply when these deferred tax assets reverse in future years 
of the million benefit  million was recognized as income in our statement of operations and million was credited directly to additional paid in capital 
industry overview our revenue and cash flows are dependent  in large part  on our licensees sales of wireless products 
over the course of the last ten years  the cellular communications industry has experienced rapid growth worldwide 
total worldwide cellular wireless communications subscribers rose from slightly more than million at the end of to billion at the end of in several countries  mobile telephones now outnumber fixed line telephones 
market analysts expect that the aggregate number of global wireless subscribers could reach billion in logo source strategy analytics  inc january and data represents estimates of handset sales 
includes analog  iden  tdma  phs  pdc  td scdma 
the growth in new cellular subscribers  combined with existing customers choosing to replace their mobile phones  helped fuel the growth of mobile phone sales from approximately million units in to over million units in we believe the combination of a broad subscriber base  continued technological change  and the ever growing dependence on the internet  e mail and other digital media sets the stage for growth in the sales of wireless products and services through the balance of this decade 
for those reasons  shipments of g enabled phones wcdma  cdma  xev do which represented approximately of the market in  are predicted to increase to of the market by in addition to the advances in digital cellular technologies  the industry has made significant advances in non cellular wireless technologies 
in particular  ieee wlan has gained momentum in recent years as a wireless broadband solution in the home  office and in public areas 
ieee technology offers high speed data connectivity through unlicensed spectrum within a relatively modest operating range 
since its introduction in  semiconductor shipments of products built to the ieee standard have nearly doubled every year 
while relatively small compared to the cellular market million ieee wireless ics shipped in  the affordability and attractiveness of the technology has helped fuel rapid market growth 
in addition  the ieee wireless standards bodies are creating sets of standards to enable higher data rates  provide coverage over longer distances and enable roaming 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of accounting principles  generally accepted in the united states of america  which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in both our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results could differ from these estimates  and any such differences may be material to the financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements  and are included in item of the form k 
we believe the accounting policies that are of particular importance to the portrayal of our financial condition and results  and that may involve a higher degree of complexity and judgment in their application compared to others  are those relating to patents  contingencies  revenue recognition  compensation  and income taxes 
if different assumptions were made or different conditions had existed  our financial results could have been materially different 
patents we capitalize external costs  such as filing fees and associated attorney fees  incurred to obtain issued patents and patent license rights 
we expense costs associated with maintaining and defending patents subsequent to their issuance 
we amortize capitalized patent costs on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the patents 
ten years represents our best estimate of the average useful life of our patents relating to technology developed directly by us 
the ten year estimated life of internally generated patents is based on our assessment of such factors as the integrated nature of the portfolios being licensed  the overall makeup of the portfolio over time and the length of license agreements for such patents 
the estimated useful lives of acquired patents and patent rights  however  are and will continue to be based on a separate analysis related to each acquisition and may differ from the estimated useful lives of internally generated patents 
we assess the potential impairment to all capitalized net patent costs when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these patents may not be recoverable 
amortization expense related to capitalized patent costs was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
as of december  and  we had capitalized gross patent costs of million and million  respectively  which were offset by accumulated amortization of million and million  respectively 
our capitalized gross patent costs in  and increased million  and million  respectively  as a result of patents acquired from third parties in those years 
the weighted average estimated useful life of our capitalized patent costs at december  and was years and years  respectively 
contingencies we recognize contingent assets and liabilities in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for contingencies 
in first quarter  we accrued a million liability related to an insurance reimbursement agreement 
our insurance carrier has demanded arbitration  claiming that our obligation under the agreement is approximately million 
at this time  it is impossible to predict the outcome of current or prospective legal proceedings with regard to this matter 
therefore  we have not adjusted our original accrual of million 
see  litigation and legal proceedings  federal 
revenue recognition in  we derived of our revenue from patent licensing 
the timing and amount of revenue recognized from each licensee depends upon a variety of factors  including the specific terms of each agreement and the nature of the deliverables and obligations 
such agreements are often complex and multi faceted 
these agreements can include  without limitation  elements related to the settlement of past patent infringement liabilities  up front and non refundable license fees for the use of patents and or know how  patent and or know how licensing royalties on covered products sold by licensees  cross licensing terms between us and other parties  the compensation structure and ownership of intellectual property rights associated with contractual technology development arrangements  and advanced payments and fees for service arrangements 
due to the combined nature of some agreements and the inherent difficulty in establishing reliable  verifiable and objectively determinable evidence of the fair value of the separate elements of these agreements  the total revenue resulting from such agreements may sometimes be recognized over the combined performance period 
in other circumstances  such as those agreements involving consideration for past and expected future patent royalty obligations  the determining factors necessary to allocate revenue across past  current  and future years may be difficult to establish 
in such instances  after consideration of the particular facts and circumstances  the appropriate recording of revenue between periods may require the use of judgment 
generally  we will not recognize revenue or establish a receivable related to payments that are due greater than twelve months from the balance sheet date 
in all cases  revenue is only recognized after all of the following criteria are met written agreements have been executed  delivery of technology or intellectual property rights has occurred or services have been rendered  fees are fixed or determinable  and collectibility of fees is reasonably assured 
patent license agreements upon signing a patent license agreement  we provide the licensee permission to use our patented inventions in specific applications 
we have no material future obligations associated with such licenses  other than  in some instances  to provide such licensees with notification of future license agreements pursuant to most favored licensee rights 
under our patent license agreements  we typically receive one or a combination of the following forms of payment as consideration for permitting our licensees to use our patented inventions in their applications and products consideration for prior sales consideration related to a licensee s product sales from prior periods 
such consideration may result from a negotiated agreement with a licensee that utilized our patented inventions prior to signing a patent license agreement with us or from the resolution of a disagreement or arbitration with a licensee over the specific terms of an existing license agreement 
in each of these cases  we record the consideration as revenue 
we may also receive consideration from the settlement of patent infringement litigation where there was no prior patent license agreement 
we record the consideration related to such litigation as other income 
fixed fee royalty payments up front  non refundable royalty payments that fulfill the licensee s obligations to us under a patent license agreement  for a specified time period or for the term of the agreement 
prepayments up front  non refundable royalty payments towards a licensee s future obligations to us related to its expected sales of covered products in future periods 
our licensees obligations to pay royalties extend beyond the exhaustion of their prepayment balance 
once a licensee exhausts its prepayment balance  we may provide them with the opportunity to make another prepayment toward future sales or it will be required to make current royalty payments 
current royalty payments royalty payments covering a licensee s obligations to us related to its sales of covered products in the current contractual reporting period 
we recognize revenues related to consideration for prior sales when we have obtained a signed agreement  identified a fixed and determinable price and determined that collectibility is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenues related to fixed fee royalty payments on a straight line basis over the effective term of the license 
we utilize the straight line method because we have no future obligations under these licenses and we cannot reliably predict in which periods  within the term of a license  the licensee will benefit from the use of our patented inventions 
licensees that either owe us current royalty payments or have prepayment balances provide us with quarterly or semi annual royalty reports that summarize their sales of covered products and their related royalty obligations to us 
we typically receive these royalty reports subsequent to the period in which our licensees underlying sales occurred 
consideration for prior sales  the exhaustion of prepayments and current royalty payments are often calculated based on related per unit sales of covered products 
in third quarter  we transitioned to recognizing these per unit royalties in the period when we receive royalty reports from licensees  rather than in the period in which our licensees underlying sales occur 
this transition was necessary because we could no longer wait to receive royalty reports from our licensees and file our financial statements on a timely basis 
without royalty reports  our visibility into our licensees sales is very limited 
we are not involved in the supply or sale of their products and industry analysts do not provide information either detailed or timely enough to give us sufficient visibility to make reasonably accurate revenue estimates for our most significant licensees 
as such  it is unlikely that we could arrive at revenue estimates for our most significant licensees that would be objective and supportable 
previously  we recognized revenue related to per unit sales of covered products in the period the sales occurred  and when we did not receive the royalty reports prior to the issuance of our financial statements  we accrued the related royalty revenue if reasonable estimates could be made 
such estimates  which were limited to a small number of licensees and never exceeded of our revenue in any period presented  were based on the historical royalty data of the licensees involved  third party forecasts of royalty related product sales in the applicable market available at the time and  if available  information provided by the licensee 
when our licensees formally reported royalties for which we had previously accrued revenues based on estimates  or when they reported updates to prior royalty reports  we adjusted revenue in the period in which the final reports were received 
in cases where we receive objective  verifiable evidence that a licensee has discontinued sales of covered products  we recognize any remaining deferred revenue balance related to unexhausted prepayments in the period that we receive such evidence 
technology solutions revenue technology solutions revenue consists primarily of revenue from software licenses and engineering services 
software license revenues are recognized in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop software revenue recognition and sop modification of sop  software revenue recognition 
when the arrangement with the customer includes significant production  modification or customization of the software  we recognize the related revenue using the percentage of completion method in accordance with sop accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
under this method  revenue and profit are recognized throughout the term of the contract  based on actual labor costs incurred to date as a percentage of the total estimated labor costs related for the contract 
changes in estimates for revenues  costs and profits are recognized in the period in which they are determinable 
when such estimates indicate that costs will exceed future revenues and a loss on the contract exists  a provision for the entire loss is recognized at that time 
we recognize revenues associated with engineering service arrangements that are outside the scope of sop on a straight line basis under staff accounting bulletin no revenue recognition  unless evidence suggests that the revenue is earned or obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern  over the contractual term of the arrangement or the expected period during which those specified services will be performed  whichever is longer 
when recognizing revenue based on our proportional performance  we measure the progress of our performance based on the relationship between incurred contract costs and total estimated contract costs 
our most significant cost has been labor and we believe labor cost provides a measure of the progress of our services 
the effect of changes to total estimated contract costs is recognized in the period such changes are determined 
estimated losses  if any  are recorded when the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable 
deferred charges from time to time  we use sales agents to assist us in our licensing activities 
we often pay a commission related to successfully negotiated license agreements 
the commission rate varies from agreement to agreement 
commissions are normally paid shortly after our receipt of cash payments associated with the patent license agreements 
we defer recognition of commission expense related to both prepayments and fixed fee royalty payments and amortize these expenses in proportion to the recognition of the related revenue 
in  and  we paid cash commissions of approximately million  million and million and recognized commission expense of million  million  and million  respectively  as part of patent administration and licensing expense 
at december  and we had approximately million and million  respectively  of deferred commission expense included within prepaid and other current assets and other non current assets 
compensation programs we use a variety of compensation programs to both attract and retain engineers and other key employees  as well as more closely align employee compensation with company performance 
these programs include  but are not limited to  an annual bonus tied to performance goals  cash awards to inventors for filed patent applications and patent issuances  restricted stock unit rsu awards to non managers and a long term compensation program ltcp  covering managers  that includes rsus and a performance based cash incentive component 
the ltcp was originally designed to include three year cycles that overlap by one year 
the first cycle under the program covered the period from april  through january  cycle 
the second cycle originally covered the period from january  through january  cycle 
in second quarter  the compensation committee of our board of directors amended the ltcp to revise the performance based cash award portion of cycle to cover a year period from july  through january   and authorized a pro rated interim payment  of approximately million  related to first half in  we recognized million and million of compensation expense related to the performance based cash incentive and rsus  respectively 
in  we recognized million and million of compensation expense related to the performance based cash incentive and rsus  respectively 
we amortize the expense associated with rsus using an accelerated method 
at december   accrued compensation expenses associated with the performance based cash incentive were based on a known payout for cycle and an estimated payout for cycle under the program  achievement of the goals set by the compensation committee of the board of directors results in a payout of the performance based cash incentive target amounts 
for each change above or below achievement  the payout is adjusted by with a maximum payout of and a zero performance based cash incentive pay out for performance that falls below of target results 
the following table provides examples of the performance based cash incentive payout that would be earned based on various levels of goal achievement goal achievement payout less than or greater at december   if we had assumed that the company s cycle goal achievement would be either or  we would have recorded either million more or less  respectively  of compensation expense in due to the structure of the different cycles in the ltcp  we expect that expenses associated with the ltcp will be approximately one half the level of however  the amount recorded could either increase or decrease dependent upon our future assessment of the expected attainment against pre established performance goals 
in fourth quarter  we accelerated the vesting of all stock options which were scheduled to vest on or after january  as a result  options to purchase approximately million shares of our common stock  that would otherwise have vested at various times over the next six years  became fully vested 
we recorded a charge of approximately million related to the acceleration 
this charge was based  in part  on our estimate that approximately of the accelerated options would have been forfeited had the acceleration not occurred 
the charge would have been approximately million if we had estimated that of the options would have been forfeited had the acceleration not occurred 
the acceleration eliminates a non cash charge of approximately million that would have been recognized under sfas r over the next six years 
we will continue to recognize expense for our remaining equity based incentive programs 
on january   we granted approximately  rsus to non management employees 
these rsus will vest over a three year period 
based on our current headcount  we expect to record compensation expense associated with this grant of approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in the period that includes the enactment date 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if management has determined that it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized 
in addition  the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
we are subject to compliance reviews by the internal revenue service irs and other taxing jurisdictions on various tax matters  including challenges to various positions we assert in our filings 
certain tax contingencies are recognized when they are determined to be both probable and reasonably estimable 
we believe we have adequately accrued for tax contingencies that have met both criteria 
as of december  and  there are certain tax contingencies that either are not considered probable or are not reasonably estimable by us at this time 
in the event that the irs or another taxing jurisdiction levies an assessment in the future  it is possible the assessment could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
we recognize deferred tax assets related to deferred revenue for both us federal income tax purposes and non us jurisdictions that assess a source withholding tax on related royalty payments 
we expense these deferred tax assets in accordance with sfas no 
as we recognize the revenue and the related temporary differences reverse 
in  and  we paid zero  million and million  respectively  of foreign source withholding tax and recognized approximately million  million and million  respectively  of foreign source withholding tax expense in our income tax provision in accordance with this policy 
generally accepted accounting principles require that we establish a valuation allowance for any portion of our deferred tax assets for which management believes it is more likely than not that we will be unable to utilize the asset to offset future taxes 
at december   we provided a full valuation allowance on all deferred tax assets  other than those associated with revenue  that was recognized in the computation of our foreign source withholding tax liability  but deferred for financial statement purposes 
in  we determined that our operating performance  coupled with our expectations to generate future taxable income  indicated that it was more likely than not that we would utilize a portion of our deferred tax assets 
accordingly  in third quarter  we recognized an increase in the value of our deferred tax assets of approximately million through a partial reversal of the valuation allowance 
of the million benefit  million was recognized as income in our statement of operations and million was credited directly to additional paid in capital 
in  we determined that our expectations to generate future taxable income indicated that it was more likely than not that we would utilize our remaining federal deferred tax assets 
accordingly  in fourth quarter  we reversed our remaining federal deferred tax asset valuation allowance of approximately million 
of the million benefit  million was recognized as income in our statement of operations and million was credited directly to additional paid in capital 
in addition  at the same time  we increased the value of our deferred tax assets by million as a result of a change in the estimated tax rate we expect will apply when these deferred tax assets reverse in future years 
of the million benefit  million was recognized as income in our statement of operations and million was credited directly to additional paid in capital 
our assessments of the value of our federal deferred tax assets did not take into consideration all potential income sources  including potential income related to current arbitration litigation matters with nokia and samsung 
we do not expect that we will reverse the remaining valuation allowance against our state deferred tax assets as we believe it is more likely than not that our state deferred tax assets will expire unutilized 
we estimate that we will fully utilize our remaining federal nol carryforwards between and once this occurs  we will begin to pay us federal income tax  as well as foreign source withholding taxes  on patent license royalties and state taxes when applicable 
in the course of future tax planning  should we identify tax saving opportunities that entail amending prior year returns in order to fully avail ourselves of credits that we previously considered unavailable to us  we will recognize the benefit of the credits in the period in which they are both identified and quantified 
under internal revenue code section  the utilization of a corporation s nol carryforwards is limited following a change in ownership as defined by the internal revenue code of greater than within a three year period 
if it is determined that prior equity transactions limit our nol carryforwards  the annual limitation will be determined by multiplying the market value on the date of ownership by the federal long term tax exempt rate 
any amount exceeding the annual limitation may be carried forward to future years for the balance of the nol carryforward period 
based on judgments associated with determining the annual limitation applicable to us under internal revenue code section  we did not include all federal nol carryforwards in the computation of our gross deferred tax assets 
we also excluded a portion of the federal research and experimental credits that may be available to us from the computation of gross deferred tax assets based upon estimates of the final credit that may be realized 
had we included all federal nol carryforwards and research and experimental credits in the computation of gross deferred tax assets  the gross deferred tax assets would have been approximately million greater and our income tax benefit would have increased by the same amount 
excluding any prospective recognition of additional tax credits  we expect to provide for income taxes in at a rate equal to our combined federal and state effective rates  which would approximate to under current tax laws  plus an amount for deferred foreign source withholding tax expense which is dependent  in part  upon licensee royalty reports 
as of december   we had net deferred foreign source withholding tax expense of approximately million on our balance sheet 
significant agreements and events technology solution agreements in december  we entered into an agreement with general dynamics  to serve as a subcontractor on the muos program for the us military 
muos is an advanced tactical terrestrial and satellite communications system utilizing g commercial cellular technology to provide significantly improved high data rate and assured communications for us warfighters 
the software license agreement sla requires us to deliver to general dynamics standards compliant wcdma modem technology  originating from the technology we developed under our agreement with infineon technologies ag  for incorporation into handheld terminals 
we have also provided product training under the sla and will provide maintenance for a period of three years  beginning january  in august  we entered into an agreement with philips semiconductors bv philips that requires us to deliver our hsdpa technology solution to philips for integration into philips family of nexperia cellular system solutions 
under the agreement  we will also assist philips with chip design and development  software modification and system integration and testing to implement our hsdpa technology solution into the philips chipset 
subsequent to the delivery of portions of our hsdpa technology solution  we will provide philips with support and maintenance over an aggregate estimated period of approximately years 
we are accounting for portions of these and other technology solutions agreements using the percentage of completion method 
from the inception of these agreements through december   we have recognized revenue of approximately million under the percentage of completion method  including million in our accounts receivable at december  and included unbilled amounts of million and million  respectively 
repositioning in august  we announced plans to close our melbourne  florida design facility 
we ceased development activity at this facility in third quarter and relocated certain development efforts and personnel to other company locations 
we closed this facility in fourth quarter on the date of the announced closing  there were thirty three full or part time employees at this facility  of which five full time employees have accepted offers of continued employment elsewhere within our organization 
we expect the repositioning to result in annual pre tax cost savings of approximately million 
in connection with the closure  we expect to recognize repositioning charges totaling approximately million  comprised of severance and relocation costs of million and facility closing costs of million 
the facility closing costs include lease termination costs  fixed asset writeoffs and costs to wind down the facility 
we recorded approximately million of this charge in and expect to record the majority of the remaining charges during the first six months of the charge was comprised of both severance and relocation costs million and facility closing costs million 
at december   our accrued liability relating to the repositioning charge was approximately million 
repositioning in second quarter  we reduced our headcount by employees and recorded a charge of approximately million associated with this repositioning 
the charge was comprised primarily of severance and other cash benefits associated with the workforce reduction 
during the balance of  we adjusted our repositioning charge by less than million and completely satisfied all liabilities associated with this restructuring 
we believe that our financial obligations associated with this repositioning are substantially complete and do not expect to report further costs associated with the repositioning 
new accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment 
sfas no 
r requires that compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements 
on april   the us securities and exchange commission adopted a new rule amending compliance dates for sfas no 
r 
in accordance with the new rule  the accounting provisions of sfas no 
r will be effective for interdigital beginning first quarter we currently expect to adopt the provisions of sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method 
sfas no 
r requires that compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be measured based on the fair value of the instruments issued 
sfas no 
r covers a wide range of share based compensation arrangements  including share options  restricted share plans  performance based awards  share appreciation rights and employee share purchase plans 
sfas no 
r replaces sfas no 
and supersedes apb opinion no 
as originally issued in  sfas no 
established as preferable the fair value based method of accounting for share based payment transactions with employees 
however  that statement permitted entities the option of continuing to apply the guidance in opinion  as long as the footnotes to financial statements disclosed what net income would have been had the preferable fair value based method been used 
in fourth quarter  we accelerated the vesting of all remaining unvested options 
the acceleration eliminates a non cash charge of approximately million that would have been recognized under sfas r over the next six years 
we adopted this standard effective january  we will continue to recognize expense for our remaining equity based incentive programs and do not believe the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 
sfas no 
the guidance in apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions apb no 
 is based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
the guidance in apb no 
 however  included certain exceptions to that principle 
sfas no 
amends apb no 
to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
sfas no 
is effective for such exchange transactions occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  we do not believe that adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
sfas no 

sfas no 
replaces apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and fasb statement no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements  and provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections 
it establishes retrospective application  or the latest practicable date  as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle and the reporting of a correction of a material error 
sfas no 
is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  we will apply the applications of sfas no 
beginning january  if and when required 
litigation and legal proceedings nokia nokia arbitration in july  nokia filed a request for arbitration against interdigital communications corporation idcc and itc  regarding nokia s royalty payment obligations for its worldwide sales of g gsm tdma and g gsm gprs edge products under the existing patent license agreement nokia license agreement with itc nokia arbitration 
the arbitration proceeding related to itc s claim that the patent license agreement itc signed with telefonakiebolaget lm ericsson and ericsson inc collectively  ericsson ericsson agreement and the patent license agreement itc signed with sony ericsson mobile communications ab sony ericsson sony ericsson agreement in march triggered nokia s obligation to pay royalties on its worldwide sales of covered g gsm tdma and g gsm gprs edge terminal units and infrastructure commencing january  an evidentiary hearing was conducted in january by an arbitral tribunal arbitral tribunal operating under the auspices of the international court of arbitration of the international chamber of commerce icc 
in june  the arbitral tribunal rendered a final award  holding that i the ericsson agreement triggered nokia s obligation to pay royalties to us for sales of covered g and g infrastructure in the period from january  through december   and ii the sony ericsson agreement triggered nokia s obligation to pay royalties to us for sales of covered g and terminal units in period from january  through december  based on the terms of the ericsson agreement and the sony ericsson agreement  the arbitral tribunal established royalty rates that are applicable to nokia s sales of covered g and terminal units and infrastructure in that period 
in july  idcc and itc filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york a petition to confirm the final award 
in december  the presiding district judge issued an order confirming the final award in its entirety 
in january  nokia filed a notice of appeal of that order to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit second circuit 
on march   the second circuit ordered that the oral arguement of the appeal will be heard no earlier than the week of july  we intend to vigorously oppose nokia s efforts to appeal 
also in december  idcc and itc took action to utilize the dispute resolution process in accordance with the terms of their patent license agreement with nokia and a related master agreement between the parties 
this dispute resolution process involves a timetable for discussions  senior representative meetings and any future initiation of arbitration  if necessary  and seeks to address issues raised by nokia s failure to abide by the final award 
idcc and itc are pursuing the dispute resolution process in order to accelerate the resolution of several issues including  without limitation  total amounts to be paid pursuant to the final award  including interest  and nokia s failure to submit royalty reports and refusal to permit an audit of nokia s books and records to determine amounts due 
idcc and itc seek to resolve any and all unresolved issues that may impact a determination of the amount to be paid under the final award 
nokia texas and north carolina proceedings in july  nokia filed in the united states district court for the northern district of texas district court a motion to intervene and to gain access to documents previously sealed by the district court in the now settled litigation between idcc and itc and ericsson  inc ericsson litigation 
we filed a response opposing the request to intervene and opposing the request for access to the documents 
the district court granted nokia s motion to intervene in the ericsson litigation and provided nokia with document access on a limited basis 
nokia subsequently filed a motion to reinstate certain orders that were vacated in the ericsson litigation  which motion was granted by the trial court 
we appealed that ruling to the us court of appeals for the federal circuit circuit court 
on august  the circuit court ruled in favor of idcc and itc and reversed the district court s order  finding that the district court had committed error in permitting nokia to intervene 
the circuit court reversed the district court s decisions which had both granted intervention and reinstated the prior vacated orders  which orders had been vacated as part of the settlement of the ericsson litigation 
in late  nokia sought to enforce two subpoenas issued by the arbitral tribunal in the above described arbitration proceeding to ericsson and sony ericsson seeking certain documents 
those enforcement actions were commenced in the federal district court for the northern district of texas and the federal district court for the eastern district of north carolina 
in february  nokia withdrew both enforcement actions 
nokia uk proceedings in june  nokia commenced a patent revocation proceeding in the english high court of justice  chancery division  patents court  seeking to have three of itc s uk patents declared invalid uk revocation proceeding 
nokia also seeks a declaration that manufacture and sale of gsm mobiles and infrastructure equipment compliant with the etsi gsm standard release without license from itc does not require infringement of the uk patents  so that none of the patents are essential ipr for that standard 
the hearing on this matter commenced early november and after several recesses concluded at the end of january  with a decision to be issued thereafter by the high court 
in july  nokia filed a claim in the english high court of justice  chancery division  patents court against itc 
nokia s claim seeks a declaration that thirty one of itc s umts european patents registered in the uk are not essential ipr for the gpp standard 
we intend to vigorously defend our position and are contesting nokia s claim of jurisdiction in the high court 
nokia delaware proceeding in january  nokia and nokia  inc filed a complaint in the united states district court for the district of delaware against idcc and itc for declaratory judgments of patent invalidity and non infringement of certain claims of certain patents  and violations of the lanham act 
in december  as a result of our motion to dismiss all of nokia s claims  the delaware district court entered an order to grant our motion to dismiss all of nokia s declaratory judgment claims due to lack of jurisdiction 
the delaware district court did not dismiss nokia s claims relating to violations of the lanham act 
under the lanham act claim  nokia alleges that we have used false or misleading descriptions or representations regarding our patents scope  validity  and applicability to products built to comply with g wireless phone standards  and that such statements have caused nokia harm 
samsung in  during an arbitration proceeding  samsung electronics co 
ltd 
samsung elected  under an mfl clause its patent license agreement with itc samsung agreement  to have samsung s royalty obligations commencing january  for g gsm tdma and g gsm gprs edge wireless communications products be determined in accordance with the terms of the nokia license agreement  including its most favored licensee mfl provision 
by notice in march  itc notified samsung that such samsung obligations had been defined by the relevant licensing terms of the ericsson agreement for infrastructure products and the sony ericsson agreement for terminal unit products as a result of the mfl provision in the nokia license agreement 
in november  samsung filed a request for arbitration with the international chamber of commerce against idcc and itc regarding samsung s royalty payment obligations to itc for its worldwide sales of g gsm tdma and g gsm gprs edge products samsung arbitration 
this arbitration proceeding relates to itc s claim that the ericsson agreement and the sony ericsson agreement defined the financial terms under which samsung is required to pay royalties on its worldwide sales of g gsm tdma and g gsm gprs edge products commencing january  through december  we also seek a declaration that the parties rights and obligations are governed by the samsung agreement  and that the nokia license agreement dictates only samsung s royalty obligations and most favored licensee rights for those tdma products licensed under the samsung agreement 
samsung is seeking a determination that samsung s obligations are not defined by the ericsson agreement  the sony ericsson agreement  or the final award in the nokia arbitration 
in the alternative  samsung seeks to determine the amount of the appropriate royalty to be paid  which is substantially less than the amount that we believe is owed 
samsung is also seeking a determination that it has succeeded to all of nokia s cdma license rights  including its g license 
if the arbitration panel were to agree with samsung s position on nokia s cdma rights  samsung would be licensed to sell g products on the same terms as nokia 
in january  an evidentiary hearing was conducted 
absent a resolution by the parties to this dispute  the presiding icc arbitral tribunal will render a decision 
lucent in march  tantivy communications  inc  one of our wholly owned subsidiaries  filed a lawsuit in the united states district court for the eastern district of texas against lucent technologies  inc lucent  a leading manufacturer of cdma infrastructure equipment 
the case was originally based on our assertions of infringement by lucent of nine of tantivy s us patents 
the lawsuit sought damages for past infringement and an injunction against future infringement  as well as interest  costs and attorneys fees 
lucent responded to the lawsuit denying any infringement  and sought a declaration of non infringement and alleged that the patents were invalid and requested attorneys fees and costs 
in november  tantivy and lucent agreed to dismiss the patent infringement litigation between them and  together with idcc  entered into a combined patent license and technology agreement 
under the terms of the agreement  lucent is obligated to pay approximately million over a period of approximately years 
tantivy granted a patent license to lucent under only those patents which were involved in the litigation being dismissed covering lucent s cdma infrastructure products 
in addition  idcc and lucent agreed to cooperate on advanced technology programs 
federal in october  federal insurance company federal  the insurance carrier which provided partial reimbursement to the company of certain legal fees and expenses for the now settled litigation involving the company and ericsson inc  delivered to us a demand for arbitration under the pennsylvania uniform arbitration act 
federal claims  based on their determination of expected value to the company resulting from our settlement involving ericsson inc  that an insurance reimbursement agreement agreement requires us to reimburse federal approximately million for attorneys fees and expenses it claims were paid by it 
additionally  under certain circumstances  federal may seek to recover interest on its claim 
in november  the company filed an action in united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania the court seeking a declaratory judgment that the reimbursement agreement is void and unenforceable  seeking reimbursement of attorneys fees and expenses which have not been reimbursed by federal and which were paid directly by the company in connection with the ericsson inc litigation  and seeking damages for federal s bad faith and breach of its obligations under the insurance policy 
in the alternative  in the event the reimbursement agreement was found to be valid and enforceable  the company was seeking a declaratory judgment that federal would have been entitled to reimbursement based only on certain portions of amounts received by the company from ericsson inc pursuant to the settlement of the litigation involving ericsson inc federal requested the court dismiss the action and or have the matter referred to arbitration 
in october  the court filed an order granting in part and denying in part federal s motion to dismiss the company s complaint 
as part of its decision  the court determined that the agreement between federal and the company which agreement served as a basis for federal s demand to recover any legal fees and expenses is enforceable  but did not address whether federal is entitled to recover any legal fees and expenses 
also  the court reserved to a later time consideration of whether any arbitration award would be binding on the parties 
additionally  in october  the company filed a motion to reconsider the court s order which subsequently was denied 
an arbitrator has been selected and the parties are currently in the process of preparing for arbitration 
a hearing date has not been scheduled 
prior to federal s demand for arbitration  we had accrued a contingent liability of million related to the agreement 
we continue to evaluate this contingent liability and have maintained this accrual at december  while we continue to contest this matter  any adverse decision or settlement obligating us to pay amounts materially in excess of the accrued contingent liability could have a material negative effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
other we have filed patent applications in the united states and in numerous foreign countries 
in the ordinary course of business  we currently are  and expect from time to time to be  subject to challenges with respect to the validity of our patents and with respect to our patent applications 
we intend to continue to vigorously defend the validity of our patents and defend against any such challenges 
however  if certain key patents are revoked or patent applications are denied  our patent licensing opportunities could be materially and adversely affected 
we and our licensees  in the normal course of business  have disagreements as to the rights and obligations of the parties under the applicable patent license agreement 
for example  we could have a disagreement with a licensee as to the amount of reported sales of covered products and royalties owed 
our patent license agreements typically provide for arbitration as the mechanism for resolving disputes 
arbitration proceedings can be resolved through an award rendered by an arbitration panel or through private settlement between the parties 
in addition to disputes associated with enforcement and licensing activities regarding our intellectual property  including the litigation and other proceedings described above  we are a party to other disputes and legal actions not related to our intellectual property  but also arising in the ordinary course of our business 
based upon information presently available to us  we believe that the ultimate outcome of these other disputes and legal actions will not have a material adverse affect on us 
financial position  liquidity and capital requirements in and  we generated net cash from operating activities of million and million  respectively 
the positive operating cash flow in arose principally from receipts of approximately million related to g and g patent licensing agreements 
these receipts included million from nec  million from sharp corporation of japan sharp  from sony ericsson  million from kyocera corporation and million from other licensees 
these receipts were partially offset by cash operating expenses operating expenses less depreciation of fixed assets  amortization of intangible assets and non cash compensation of million and changes in working capital during the positive operating cash flow in arose principally from receipts of approximately million related to g and g patent licensing agreements 
these receipts included million from nec  million from sanyo electric co  ltd sanyo  million from sharp  million and million from ericsson and sony ericsson  respectively  million from toshiba corporation toshiba and million from other licensees 
these receipts were partially offset by cash operating expenses operating expenses less depreciation of fixed assets  amortization of intangible assets and non cash compensation of million and changes in working capital during we receive cash payments relating to current per unit royalties 
we also receive up front cash payments for prepaid royalties or to fulfill a patent licensee s obligations to us under a patent license agreement for either a specified time period or for the term of the agreement 
when we record the receipt or expected receipt of up front payments  we defer recognition of the revenue associated with such payments pursuant to our revenue recognition policy as discussed in our critical accounting policies 
we have no material obligations associated with such deferred revenue 
our combined short term and long term deferred revenue balances at december  was approximately million  a decrease of million from december  the decrease was mainly due to current year deferred revenue recognition of approximately million related to the amortization of fixed fee royalty payments and approximately million from current year per unit exhaustion of prepaid royalties based upon royalty reports provided by our licensees offset  in part  by the receipt of approximately million in prepayments and fixed fee amounts  primarily from new  expanded or amended patent license agreements  including million from sony ericsson  million from kyocera and million from other licensees 
based on current license agreements  in  we expect the amortization of fixed fee royalty payments to reduce the december  deferred revenue balance of million by million 
additional reductions to deferred revenue will be dependent upon the level of per unit royalties our licensees report against prepaid balances 
in first quarter  we recorded gross increases in deferred revenue of approximately million  million of which relates to payments received and due from lg  and approximately million which relates to new prepayments from two other existing licensees 
in first quarter  we collected the first million payment from lg and recorded million in accounts receivable relating to lg s second payment due in first quarter in accordance with our policy for recording long term receivables from patent license agreements  we will defer recognition in accounts receivable of lg s third million payment  which is due in first quarter  until twelve months prior to its due date 
in  we generated net cash from investing activities of million 
in  we used million for these same activities 
we sold million of short term marketable securities  net of purchases  in we purchased million of short term marketable securities  net of sales  in this change resulted from a higher use of cash in financing activities 
purchases of property and equipment increased to million in from million in due to investments in development tools and the expansion of our engineering information system network 
investment costs associated with patents increased from million in to million in this increase reflects higher patenting activity over the past several years  combined with the lag effect between filing an initial patent application and the incurrence of costs to issue the patent in both the us and foreign jurisdictions 
in  we expect that purchases of property and equipment in support of planned technology development initiatives will be million to million 
we also expect that capitalized patent costs will be between million to million 
in first quarter  we acquired  for a purchase price of approximately million  selected patents  intellectual property blocks and related assets from an unrelated third party  the function of which are aimed at improving the range  throughput and reliability of wireless lan and other wireless technology systems 
net cash used in financing activities in increased million to million from million in in  we repurchased two million shares of our common stock for million compared to repurchases of one million shares of common stock in for million 
we received proceeds from option and warrant exercises of million and million in and  respectively 
we had million and million stock options outstanding at december  and  respectively  that had exercise prices less than the fair market value of our common stock at each balance sheet date 
these options would have generated million and million of cash proceeds to us had they been fully exercised at these dates 
as of december   we had million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  compared to million at december  our working capital adjusted to exclude cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  current maturities of debt and current deferred revenue increased to million at december  from million at december  this million increase is primarily due to a million increase in current deferred tax assets associated with the recognition of an increase in the value of these assets in fourth quarter  offset  in part  by the net changes in other elements of working capital 
in december  we entered into a two year million unsecured revolving credit facility the credit agreement 
the credit agreement was entered into by the company  bank of america  na  as administrative agent  and citizens bank of pennsylvania 
at our option  borrowings under the credit agreement will bear interest at libor plus basis points  depending on the level of borrowing under the credit facility  or under certain conditions at the prime rate or if higher  basis points above the federal funds rate 
the credit agreement further contains certain customary restrictive financial and operating covenants which  among other things  require us to i maintain certain minimum cash and short term investment levels of times outstanding borrowings subject to adjustments defined in the agreement  ii maintain minimum financial performance requirements as measured by our income or loss before taxes  with certain adjustments  and iii limit or prohibit the incurrence of certain indebtedness and or liens  judgments above a threshold amount for which a reserve is not maintained  and certain other activities outside the ordinary course of business 
borrowings under the credit agreement can be used for general corporate purposes including capital expenditures  working capital  letters of credit  certain permitted acquisitions and investments  cash dividends and stock repurchases 
as of december   we did not have any amounts outstanding under the credit agreement 
consistent with our strategy to focus our resources on the development and commercialization of advanced wireless technology products  we expect to see modest growth in operating cash needs related to planned staffing levels and continued investments in enabling capital assets in we are capable of supporting these and other operating cash requirements  including repurchases of our common stock  for the near future through cash and short term investments on hand  other operating funds such as patent license royalty payments or the above noted credit facility 
an adverse resolution of the litigation involving federal insurance company see  litigation and legal proceedings  federal should not prevent us from supporting our operating requirements for the near future 
at present  we do not anticipate the need to seek additional financing through additional bank facilities or the sale of debt or equity securities 
contractual obligations with the exception of two purchase orders totaling million for tools associated with our fdd wcdma development programs  we did not have any significant purchase obligations outside our ordinary course of business at december  the following is a summary of our consolidated debt and lease obligations at december  in millions obligation total years years thereafter debt operating leases total debt and operating lease obligations off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined by regulation s k a promulgated under the securities act of results of operations compared with revenues per unit royalty revenue a fixed fee and amortized royalty revenue recurring patent licensing royalties past infringement and other non recurring royalties total patent licensing royalties technology solutions revenue total revenue a in  we transitioned to recognizing revenue associated with per unit royalties in the quarter when royalty reports are received from licensees  rather than in the quarter in which our licensees underlying sales occurred 
due to this transition  revenues for included only three quarters of per unit royalties 
in  revenues increased  to million from million in this increase resulted from growth in royalties from existing licensees at december  incremental revenue from patent licensees added in  growth in revenue related to technology solution agreements with general dynamics  philips and others  and the effect of the above noted third quarter transition in reporting per unit royalties 
revenues included non recurring revenue of million related to past infringement  primarily associated with a new patent license agreement with kyocera  compared with million in revenues also included million of non recurring royalties related to the remaining deferred revenue balance of a licensee that had discontinued sales of covered products 
technology solution revenue increased substantially in to million from million in this increase was primarily due to the recognition of million of revenue associated with the majority of our deliverables under the muos program for the us military under our agreement with general dynamics 
we expect to recognize an additional million in related to final deliverables  and will amortize an additional million related to our maintenance services under that agreement over a three year period  beginning january  in and  respectively  and of our revenues were from companies that individually accounted for or more of total revenues 
in  those companies were nec and sharp 
in  the comparable list included nec  sharp and sony ericsson 
operating expenses operating expenses increased from million in to million in the million increase was primarily due to increases in the following items in millions patent litigation and arbitration long term compensation program ltcp other personnel related costs executive severance repositioning patent amortization other a total increase in operating expense a other cost increases include tools and equipment  commissions  travel and all other costs  none of which represent more than of the increase in this line item 
patent litigation and arbitration costs increased as a result of i arbitration and related litigations with nokia  ii litigation with lucent that was settled in  and iii preparation for arbitration with samsung  the hearing for which took place in january costs associated with our ltcp increased due to the overlap of cycles and that occurred in other personnel costs increased primarily due to higher levels of headcount prior to a third quarter repositioning 
the increase in patent amortization resulted from an acquisition of a patent portfolio in and higher levels of internal inventive activity in recent years 
other costs increased due to work on our hsdpa platform development  higher commission expense resulting from higher levels of royalty revenue  and higher travel costs associated with increased customer procurement and service requirements 
the following table summarizes the change in operating expenses by category in millions increase sales and marketing general and administrative patents administration and licensing development repositioning total operating expense sales and marketing expense approximately of the increase in sales and marketing expense was due to personnel costs  primarily resulting from the overlap of cycles and of our ltcp that occurred in the balance of the increase was mainly due to higher costs associated with increased trade show activities 
general and administrative expense the increase in general and administrative expenses resulted from increased personnel costs  including million of executive severance and a million increase in ltcp costs resulting from overlapping cycles in patents administration and licensing expense approximately million of the overall increase in patents administration and licensing expense was due to higher patent enforcement costs related to an arbitration with nokia that concluded in  litigation with nokia that remains outstanding  litigation with lucent that was settled in and preparation for an arbitration with samsung that took place in january another million of the increase was due to increased patent amortization resulting from the acquisition of a patent portfolio in and higher levels of internal inventive activity in recent years 
in addition  commission expense increased approximately million due to higher levels of royalty revenue 
the balance of the increase was due to higher staff levels and ltcp costs resulting from overlapping cycles in development expense approximately million of the increase in development expenses was due to personnel costs 
approximately million of this increase was due to ltcp costs resulting from overlapping cycles in  with the balance related to higher levels of headcount prior to a third quarter repositioning 
the remaining increase in development expense resulted from targeted outsourced services  tools and equipment and other costs related to work on our hsdpa platform development 
repositioning expense costs associated with the repositioning were higher than the repositioning due to both higher levels of headcount reduction and higher facility closure costs 
interest and investment income  net net interest and investment income of million in increased million or from million in the increase resulted from higher rates of return on our investments in income taxes our income tax provision in included benefits totaling million  primarily related to the fourth quarter reversal of our federal deferred tax asset valuation allowance a portion of this reversal was credited directly to additional paid in capital  which were partly offset by million of federal income tax and alternative minimum tax  and million of foreign source withholding tax 
our income tax provision in included a benefit of approximately million related to the partial reversal of our federal deferred tax asset valuation allowance and was offset in part by approximately million of federal income tax and alternative minimum tax and approximately million of foreign source withholding tax 
the net income tax benefit associated with adjustments to the value of our deferred tax assets is comprised of the following components in millions reversal of federal valuation allowance change in effective tax rate applied to federal deferred tax assets other adjustments to deferred tax assets total adjustments related to federal deferred tax asset valuation the million and million reversals of the federal valuation allowance in and  respectively  were based on expectations that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to utilize our federal deferred tax assets 
the million change in the effective tax rate applied to federal deferred tax assets is related to a change in the estimated tax rate we expect will apply when these deferred tax assets reverse 
the remaining million adjustment of our deferred tax assets reduces the recorded value of credits associated with federal nol carryforwards and research and development activities based on our assessment of the likelihood of realizing such credits

due to this transition  revenues for included only three quarters of per unit royalties 
revenues in were million compared with million in the decrease in revenues was due to the absence of per unit royalties in third quarter associated with the transition in reporting per unit royalties 
notwithstanding the effect of the transition in reporting per unit royalties on revenues  recurring patent license royalties which include both fixed and amortized amounts  as well as per unit royalties reported to us increased from million in to million in the million increase in recurring patent license royalty revenue from to was primarily due to an increase in royalties from nec  offset by the absence of reporting per unit royalties for one quarter in in  we recorded non recurring revenue of million related to past infringement from a number of new licensees signed in and million associated with the remaining deferred revenue balance of a licensee that has discontinued sales of covered products 
in  we recorded million of non recurring royalty revenue  primarily associated with sony ericsson s pre handset sales 
technology solution revenue decreased to million in from million in the decrease was due to the fact that included million related to final deliverables under a technology development agreement with nokia 
in and  respectively  and of our revenues were from companies that individually accounted for or more of total revenues 
in  these companies were nec  sharp and sony ericsson 
in the comparable list included nec  sony ericsson and sharp 
operating expenses operating expenses increased from million in to million in the increase in our operating expenses reflected both a commitment to investing in the development of advanced wireless technology solutions and legal costs associated with arbitration and litigation proceedings involving nokia  samsung and lucent 
the million increase in operating expenses was primarily due to increases in personnel costs million  legal fees million  patent amortization million and insurance premiums million and was partly offset by savings in other areas 
approximately and  respectively  of the increase in personnel costs was due to company wide compensation initiatives instituted in first half and the addition  in mid  of a design center in melbourne  florida 
the remaining increase in personnel costs was primarily due to severance associated with a second quarter repositioning and expanded training and development programs 
development expenses increased in to million from million in the increase resulted from a million increase in personnel costs primarily associated with compensation initiatives instituted in first half  offset  in part  by a decrease of million each related to consulting fees and depreciation of fixed assets 
sales and marketing expenses of million in increased from million in primarily due to a million increase in personnel costs offset  in part  by decreased consulting costs 
general and administrative expenses in increased to million from million in increased personnel costs accounted for of this increase  with the balance due to increased public entity costs  including audit fees and insurance premiums 
patents administration and licensing expenses increased in to million from million in nearly of this increase was due to higher patent enforcement costs related to our respective arbitrations with nokia and samsung and a litigation with lucent 
other income  interest and investment income  net in  we recognized million from the settlement of litigation with ericsson  net of an estimated million associated with a claim under an insurance reimbursement agreement  as other income 
the million represents a loss contingency associated with an insurance reimbursement agreement with federal 
net interest and investment income of million in remained relatively level with income taxes our income tax provision in included a benefit of approximately million related to the partial reversal of our federal deferred tax asset valuation allowance and was offset in part by approximately million of federal income tax and alternative minimum tax and approximately million of foreign source withholding tax 
our income tax provision in consisted primarily of foreign source withholding taxes associated with patent licensing royalties  principally from japan 
the decrease in our foreign source withholding tax expense from to resulted primarily from a july tax treaty between the us and japan that eliminates the foreign source withholding tax requirements between these countries  provided certain conditions defined in the treaty are met 
expected trends in first quarter  we expect to report revenue of million to million 
this revenue amount includes slightly more than million related to the recently announced patent license agreement with lg for which we are recognizing revenue associated with million in total expected payments on a straight line amortization over the approximately five year term of the agreement as well as increases in sales from some of our other licensees 
we anticipate that first quarter operating expenses  excluding current patent arbitration or litigation costs  will be in line with those experienced in fourth quarter reflecting continued investment in our dual mode terminal unit offering 
patent arbitration and litigation expense will depend on the level of activity through the remainder of the quarter 
lastly  we expect that our book tax rate for first quarter will approximate to
