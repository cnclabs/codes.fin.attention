item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for more information regarding these investigations and their effects on us 
our business and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties arising from domestic and international laws and regulations which may require us to obtain regulatory approvals in order to manufacture and market our products 
united states 
in the united states  the development  testing  manufacture  labeling  marketing  promotion and sale of medical devices is regulated principally by the fda under the federal food  drug and cosmetic act 
the fda has broad discretion in enforcing compliance with that statute and its regulations 
our ability to continue to sell our products commercially is subject to continuing fda oversight of the ongoing design  manufacturing  packaging  labeling  storage and quality of our medical devices 
while we believe we are currently in full compliance with the fda  we are subject to additional inspections by the fda and cannot assure you that we will be in full compliance during any future fda inspections  particularly with respect to facilities maintained by any third party with which we have an agreement to manufacture our catheters or components of our other products 
noncompliance can result in fines  injunctions  civil penalties  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production  failure to grant pre market clearance or pre market approval for devices  withdrawal of manufacturing or marketing approvals and criminal prosecution  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we expect to seek fda approval and approval by a european notified body for various products as well as improvements to our current products 
approval of these products and product improvements by the fda and european notified body is based upon  among other things  the results of clinical trials that demonstrate the safety and efficacy of such products 
our failure to obtain regulatory approval or the delay in the approval of these products from either regulatory body could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 
international 
in order for us to market our products in europe and certain other foreign jurisdictions  we must obtain required regulatory approvals and clearances and otherwise comply with extensive regulations regarding safety and manufacturing processes and quality 
these regulations  including the requirements for approvals or clearance to market and the time required for regulatory review  vary from country to country 
foreign countries also often have extensive regulations regarding safety  manufacturing processes and quality that differ from those in the united states and must be met in order to continue sale of a product within that country 
we may not be able to obtain regulatory approvals in such countries or we may be required to incur significant costs in obtaining or maintaining our foreign regulatory approvals 
failure to obtain approvals or delays in the receipt of approvals to market our products and or failure to maintain the approvals we currently have and those which we may receive in the future would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and prospects 
presently  we are permitted to sell some of our products in countries that are members of the european union 
however  there can be no assurances that we will be successful in maintaining that permission 

table of contents we are subject to new corporate governance requirements  and our costs of compliance with  or our failure to comply with  existing and future requirements could adversely affect our business 
we face new corporate governance requirements under the sarbanes oxley act of  as well as new rules and regulations subsequently adopted by the commission  the public company accounting oversight board and nasdaq 
these laws  rules and regulations continue to evolve and may become increasingly stringent in the future and we expect that our legal and financial compliance costs will increase 
we also expect that these new requirements may make it more difficult and expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance 
in particular  we may be required to include the management and auditor reports on internal control as part of our annual report for the year ended december   pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act 
we are in the process of evaluating and implementing our internal controls structure to provide reasonable assurance that our public disclosure would be accurate and complete and to help ensure that we will be able to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act 
however  due to the inherent limitations of control systems  we cannot assure you that we will be able to fully comply with these laws  rules and regulations 
our failure to comply with these laws  rules and regulations may materially adversely affect our reputation  our financial condition and the value of our securities 
our operations are subject to environmental  health and safety laws and regulations that could require us to incur material costs 
we are subject to various federal  state  and local environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations  and we incur costs to comply with those laws 
environmental laws hold current or previous owners or operators of businesses and real property potentially liable for contamination on that property  even if they did not know of and were not responsible for the contamination 
environmental laws may also impose liability on any person who disposes or arranges for the disposal of hazardous substances for contamination at the disposal site  regardless of whether the disposal site is owned or operated by such person 
although we do not currently anticipate that the costs of complying with environmental laws  including costs for remediation of contaminated properties  if any  will be material  we cannot ensure that we will not incur material costs or liabilities in the future due to the discovery of new facts or conditions  the occurrence of new releases of hazardous materials or a change in environmental laws 
risks relating to our securities and significant shareholders our principal shareholders have the ability to control us and their interests may conflict with the interests of our other shareholders 
as a result of our prior private placement financings  we have shareholders who hold a large percentage of our outstanding shares of common stock 
david a 
jenkins  our president  chief executive officer  chief operating officer and chairman of our board of directors  beneficially owns  either directly or indirectly through entities in which he has ownership  approximately  shares of our common stock  or of the outstanding shares of our common stock  assuming currently exercisable warrants held directly or indirectly by him are fully exercised 
abhijeet lele  one of our directors  beneficially owns  either directly or indirectly through limited partnerships of which he has management control  approximately  shares of our common stock  or of the outstanding shares of our common stock  assuming currently exercisable warrants held directly or indirectly by him are fully exercised 
to the extent that these shareholders exercise their voting rights in concert  they may have the ability to appoint new management and to control the outcome of matters submitted to a vote of the holders of our common stock 
in addition  because our certificate of incorporation does not provide for cumulative voting with respect to election of directors  these shareholders and their affiliates may be able to control the election of members of our board of directors 
the interests of these equity holders may at times conflict with the interests of our other shareholders 
our common stock price is volatile and may decline even if our business is doing well 
the market price of our common stock has been  and is likely to continue to be  highly volatile 
market prices for securities of medical device companies  including ours  have historically been highly volatile  and the market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
the following factors can have a significant effect on the market price of our common stock announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or others  clinical trial results  developments concerning agreements with collaborators  government regulation  developments in patent or other proprietary rights  public concern as to the safety of electrophysiology products developed by us or others  future sales of substantial amounts of our common stock by existing shareholders  and comments by securities analysts and general market conditions 

table of contents the realization of any of the risks described in these risk factors could have a negative affect on the market price of our common stock 
our common stock trades on the nasdaq capital market quotation system 
in the future  our common stock may be removed from listing on the nasdaq capital market quotation system and may not qualify for listing on any stock exchange  in which case it may be difficult to find a market in our common stock 
our common stock trades on the nasdaq capital market 
nasdaq has several requirements for companies to meet for continued listing  including minimum stockholders equity 
if we fail to demonstrate compliance with all requirements for continued listing on the nasdaq capital market  our common stock could be delisted from the nasdaq capital market 
there can be no assurance that we will satisfy the requirements for continued listing on the nasdaq capital market 
if our common stock is no longer traded on the nasdaq capital market  it may be more difficult for holders of our common stock to sell any shares that they own and the price of our common stock may be negatively affected 
as a result  there is a risk that holders of our common stock may not be able to obtain accurate price quotes or be able to correctly assess the market price of our common stock 
increases in volatility could also make it more difficult to pledge shares of our common stock as collateral  if holders sought to do so  because a lender might be unable to accurately value our common stock 
if we fail to maintain our listing on the nasdaq capital market for any reason  our common stock will be traded on the nasdaq over the counter bulletin board otcbb or may be considered a penny stock under regulations of the commission and trade on the pink sheets  each of which would impose additional sales practice requirements on broker dealers who buy and sell our securities 
the additional burdens imposed upon broker dealers by these requirements could discourage broker dealers from effecting transactions in our common stock  which could severely limit the market liquidity of our common stock and the ability of the holders of our common stock to sell our securities in the secondary market 
this also could limit our ability to raise additional financing 
future sales of our common stock by existing shareholders could negatively affect the market price of our common stock and make it more difficult for us to sell shares of our common stock in the future 
sales of our common stock in the public market  or the perception that such sales could occur  could result in a drop in the market price of our securities and make it more difficult for us to complete future equity financings 
we have outstanding the following shares of common stock approximately  shares of common stock are either freely tradable in the public markets or are eligible for sale in the public markets 
as of march   there is an aggregate of approximately  shares of common stock that may be issued on the exercise of outstanding stock options granted under our long term incentive plan  our director option plan  our stock option plan  our stock option plan  our director plan  and other agreements pursuant to which nonqualified options were granted at a weighted average exercise price of per share 
as of march   there is an aggregate of approximately  shares of common stock that may be issued on the exercise of outstanding warrants 
we have in effect a registration statement under the securities act registering approximately  shares of our common stock which may be issued upon conversion of the laurus convertible note 
in addition  as a result of the completion of our recent equity financing in march  we will be required to issue an additional  shares of our common stock upon a conversion of the outstanding balance of the laurus convertible note due to the application of certain anti dilution provisions contained therein 
we have a number of shareholders that own significant blocks of our common stock 
such concentration of ownership could affect the liquidity of our common stock and have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock 
if these shareholders sell large portions of their holdings in a relatively short time  for liquidity or other reasons  the market price of our common stock could drop significantly 

table of contents potential issuance of preferred stock may delay  defer or prevent corporate takeover 
our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of undesignated preferred stock and to determine the rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions of such shares without any further vote or action by the shareholders 
our board of directors  without shareholder approval  can issue preferred stock with voting and conversion rights  which could adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our common stock 
we have no present intention to issue shares of preferred stock 
the potential future issuance of preferred stock under certain circumstances may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of us or otherwise adversely affecting the rights of the holders of common stock 
our certificate of incorporation does not provide for cumulative voting  but does provide for a staggered board  which could delay or prevent a change of control 
our certificate of incorporation does not provide for cumulative voting with respect to the election of directors  but does provide for staggered elections of directors 
as a result  shareholders who have large holdings of our common stock may be able to control the election of members of our board of directors  which may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us  including transactions in which our shareholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over current market prices 
the staggered board provision makes it more difficult for shareholders to change the majority of directors even when the only reason for the change may be the performance of the present directors 
such provisions are applicable to all elections of directors  not only elections occurring after a change in control 
certain provisions of our by laws  other agreements  and applicable state laws may have anti takeover effects 
our by laws provide that only our board of directors  the chairman of our board of directors or our president may call a special meeting of the shareholders and that shareholders may not take action by written consent without a meeting 
these provisions limit the ability of a potential acquirer or shareholders favoring a change of control to act quickly by special meeting or without a meeting 
in the event of a change in control of the company  the vesting of all options granted pursuant to our long term incentive plan  director option plan  stock option plan  stock option plan  director plan and other agreements accelerate immediately prior to such change in control 
currently  approximately  shares are issuable upon the exercise of vested options and approximately  shares are issuable upon the exercise of unvested options granted pursuant to these plans and agreements 
section a a of the new jersey business corporation act also known as the new jersey shareholders protection act provides that  with certain exceptions  an interested stockholder is prohibited from engaging in a business combination with the company for five years following the date the stockholder first became interested unless the company s board approved the particular business combination before the acquirer became an interested stockholder 
after five years have elapsed  the interested stockholder may engage in a business combination if certain conditions are met

item legal proceedings 
during the second quarter of  the company received an administrative subpoena from the bureau of industry and security of the united states department of commerce the department of commerce seeking production of records and documents relating to the sale and or export of the company s products to iran and to syria 
in the third quarter of  the company was informed that the united states attorney s office for the district of new jersey had commenced a criminal investigation into the same matter 
in march  the united states attorney s office informed the company that it will not prosecute the company in connection with this matter 
in a letter dated august   the company was informed by the philadelphia district office of the securities and exchange commission the sec district office that the commission is conducting a confidential  informal inquiry to determine whether there have been violations of certain provisions of the federal securities laws in connection with the company s financial and accounting reporting  including relating to disclosures the company made in its form k filed with the commission on august  regarding ongoing government investigations of sales by the company of its products to iran 
the company is cooperating fully with the federal government in connection with these matters 
based on the company s investigation of these matters to date  management believes that a limited number of the company s heart monitor systems were distributed to medical facilities in iran without united states governmental authorization 
we believe the aggregate revenues generated by these transactions were not material to the company s cumulative financial results during the period in which such transactions occurred  and the company has taken steps to implement certain control procedures designed to prevent the company s products or services from being provided to any foreign countries in violation of applicable law 
the fact that certain of the company s heart monitor systems were distributed to medical facilities in iran without united states government authorization was voluntarily disclosed by the company in to the department of commerce and to the office of foreign assets control of the united states treasury department 
the federal government is also investigating the accuracy and completeness of those voluntary disclosures 
separately  the audit committee of the company s board of directors is conducting an independent investigation into these matters and has retained outside counsel to assist it 
in the third quarter of  the company incurred approximately  in legal  consulting and accounting expenses associated with the governmental and audit committee investigations 
additional amounts in the third quarter over previously estimated costs were associated with the additional resource requirement for the commission s inquiry  additional document review  additional interviews and the termination of reinhard schmidt  our former president  chief executive officer and chief operating officer 
in the fourth quarter  the company incurred  in legal  consulting and accounting expenses associated with the governmental and audit committee investigations and  associated with the company s defense and negotiations with the government 
management currently estimates that additional legal fees and other expenses to be incurred by the company in connection with the investigation by the audit committee may be in excess of  but cannot predict whether such fees and other expenses will be significantly higher 
this estimate does not include any costs associated with the defense of the company or negotiation with the various governmental entities to resolve these outstanding issues as these costs are not estimable but may have a material impact on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
violations of applicable law may result in civil  administrative or criminal fines or penalties  but due primarily to the ongoing nature of the investigations referred to above  it is not possible at this time to predict the outcome of these investigations or the impact of costs of ultimately resolving this matter on our results of operations or financial condition 
however  any fees or expenses or any fines or penalties which might be incurred by the company in connection with these matters may have a material impact on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the company has made no provision for any future costs associated with the investigations or any costs associated with the company s defense or negotiations with the various governmental entities to resolve these outstanding issues 

table of contents in november  the company met with various governmental agencies to review the results of the investigation 
since that time there have been numerous conversations and meetings with various governmental agencies with which we have been cooperating fully  but we cannot predict when we will have a resolution to these outstanding issues 
on october   the board of directors terminated reinhard schmidt s employment as its president  chief executive officer and chief operating officer for cause 
mr 
schmidt s termination resulted from his certification and authorization of statements to the department of commerce  some of which the audit committee has determined in its independent investigation to have been inaccurate or incomplete 
mr 
schmidt s termination was not a result of the discovery of any financial or accounting irregularity by the investigation 
pursuant to mr 
schmidt s employment agreement  his position as a director of the company ceased upon the termination of his employment 
at this time  mr 
schmidt has not contested this termination  but it is possible he could contest it at a later time 
the likelihood of such a contest  if any  or results of any arbitration or adjudication  cannot be estimated at this time 
in the fourth quarter of  we terminated our agreements with our armenian and german distributors 
the german distributor is contesting the termination  and while we believe its claim is without merit  we cannot  at this time estimate the costs we may incur in enforcing this termination or the impact on our revenue

the following table sets forth the high and low sale prices for our common stock for the periods indicated 
period high low first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter holders as of march   there were approximately registered holders of record of our common stock 
this number excludes individual shareholders holding stock under nominee security position listings because many of such shares are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of shareholders 
as a result  we are unable to estimate the total number of shareholders represented by these record holders  but we believe that the amount is in excess of dividend policy historically  we have not paid any dividends to our shareholders  and we do not expect to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future

overview the company was incorporated in january and operates in a single industry segment 
we develop  manufacture  market and sell a line of products for the cardiac rhythm management  or electrophysiology ep  market used to diagnose  monitor  visualize and treat irregular heartbeats known as arrhythmias 
since our inception  we have acquired technology and marketing rights  have developed new products and have begun marketing various electrophysiology products  including our ep workmate computerized electrophysiology workstation  the rpm realtime position management navigation technology  our ep computerized cardiac stimulator  diagnostic electrophysiology catheters including our unique one piece catheter  viewmate intracardiac ultrasound catheter system and related disposable supplies and our alert system including the alert companion ii and alert family of internal cardioversion catheters our core diagnostic product is the ep workmate  a computerized electrophysiology workstation that monitors displays and stores cardiac electrical activity and arrhythmia data 
the ep workmate offers  among other features  display and storage of up to intracardiac signals  real time diagnosis  analysis and integration with our own proprietary systems  such as our ep stimulator  as well as with those of market leaders  such as boston scientific corporations rpm realtime position management navigation system  philips medical systems allura x ray system and with other technologies and systems 
late in the third quarter of  we received fda market clearance to sell the ep workmate integrated with rpm realtime position management system 
this approval was the culmination of a strategic joint development project between boston scientific corporation and ep med 
it is the only ep recording system on the market to integrate advanced recording and stimulation with anatomic modeling  advanced mapping and d navigation features  allowing electrophysiology studies to be more efficient and user friendly 
the ep stimulator is a computerized signal generator and processor which  when integrated with the ep workmate  is used to stimulate the heart with electrical impulses in order to locate arrhythmia 
during  the ep workmate  the rpm realtime position management system and the ep stimulator accounted for approximately of our total sales 
we also market a line of diagnostic electrophysiology catheters for stimulation and sensing of electrical signals during electrophysiology studies  which represented approximately of our total sales revenues in we have also developed the viewmate intracardiac ultrasound catheter system including the viewmate ultrasound imaging console and viewflextm intracardiac imaging catheters 
these products offer high resolution  real time ultrasound capability designed to improve a physician s or clinician s ability to visualize inside the chambers of the heart 
we believe the viewmate ultrasound system may play an important role for a broad range of potential 
table of contents applications in electrophysiology and cardiology 
sales of the viewmate system and related viewflex catheters accounted for approximately of our total sales revenues in we have also developed a product for the treatment of atrial fibrillation known as the alert system  which uses a patented electrode catheter to deliver measured  variable  low energy electrical impulses directly to the inside of the heart to convert atrial fibrillation to a normal heart rhythm 
we have obtained class iii design examination certification from a european notified body allowing us to label the alert system with a ce mark  an international symbol of adherence to quality assurance standards  design reviews and hazard analysis  which permits us to sell the alert system in the european community 
sales of the alert system and related catheters accounted for approximately of our total sales revenues in critical accounting policies financial reporting release no 
requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
the commission indicated that a critical accounting policy is one which is important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
note of our notes to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  financial reporting release no 
requires all companies to include a discussion to address  among other things  liquidity  off balance sheet arrangements  contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
the information provided below describing our debt and future commitments is provided to facilitate a review of our liquidity and capital resources 
the following is a brief discussion of the more significant accounting policies and methods used by us 
general the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
the primary estimates used by management are in the determination of the allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory obsolescence reserve and warranty reserve 
although these estimates are based upon management s knowledge of current events  the estimates may ultimately differ from actual results 
revenue recognition we ship products to our customers based on fob shipping point and  as such  recognize product sales on the date of shipment 
installation of the products is considered perfunctory 
payments received in advance of shipment of product are deferred until such products are shipped 
we do not have royalty agreements that result in revenue to ep med and we do not provide distributors or end users with a general right to return products purchased 
we have three sales channels direct sales to customers  sales to independent distributors  and sales to alliance partners 
our products do not require installation in the traditional sense  but the ep workmate does require a set up 
for distributors  the distributor is responsible for all set up of all electronic hardware products  and we have no obligation after shipment of products to the distributors 
for direct sales  while the customer can perform the set up on its own  ep med personnel generally will assist customers in this process 
the set up process  which takes approximately hours to complete  is usually performed shortly after shipment and primarily consists of assembling the workstation cart and plugging in the monitors  printer  isolation transformer  and the ep stimulator to the main computer 
this process does not impact our standard payment terms 
for sales to distributors  payment terms are defined in the distributor agreements as of the purchase price being due to days after shipment 
for direct sales  payment terms are agreed in advance of the sale and generally require a deposit prior to shipment  with the balance due to days after shipment 
we provide a standard one year warranty on all of our products  and in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  we accrue the estimated cost of providing the warranty at the time of sale 
the estimates of the future costs are based on historical data 
we also sell various types of warranty contracts to our customers 
these contracts range in term from one to five years 
revenue is recognized on these contracts on a straight line basis over the life of the contract 

table of contents valuation of accounts receivable we continuously monitor customers balances  collections and payments  and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
we may request letters of credit from our customers when we believe that there is a significant risk of credit loss 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
valuation of inventory we value our inventory at the lower of cost or market  with cost being determined on a first in  first out basis 
we continually monitor our slow moving items  and establish reserve amounts on a specific identification basis  as necessary 
in addition  due to the fact that our business is dependent on the latest computer technology  we continually monitor our inventory and products for obsolescence 
if we determine market value to be less than cost  we write down the cost to that value 
generally  we do not experience significant writedowns  losses  etc 
with the valuation of our inventory  however  these reserves are estimates  which could change significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  depending on market and competitive conditions 
valuation of goodwill  intangible assets  and other long lived assets we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and enterprise level goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill and enterprise level goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
income taxes we account for our income taxes under the liability method 
under the liability method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities as measured by the enacted tax rates which will be in effect when these differences reverse 
deferred tax expense is the result of changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
accounting for stock based compensation 
we have elected to measure our stock based compensation expense relating to grants to employees under our stock option plans using the intrinsic value method 
under this method  we record no compensation expense when we grant stock options to employees if the exercise price for a fixed stock option award to an employee is equal to the fair value of the underlying common stock at the date we grant the stock option 
a different method for accounting for employee stock option grants is the fair value method 
under the fair value method  a company is required to determine the fair value of options granted to employees based on an option pricing model which incorporates such factors as the current stock price  exercise prices of the options  expected volatility of future movements in the price of the underlying stock  risk free interest rates  the term of the options and any dividends 
table of contents expected to be paid 
the fair value determined under this method is then amortized over the vesting period of the related options 
had we chosen to account for employee stock options using the fair value method  we would have recorded additional stock based compensation expense of approximately  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
on december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which is an amendment to sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
this new standard eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and generally requires such transactions to be accounted for using a fair value based method and the resulting cost recognized in our financial statements 
this new standard is effective beginning in the first fiscal year beginning after june  we will adopt this new standard effective for the first quarter of the company will use the modified prospective method upon adoption and therefore not restate prior period results 
under the modified prospective method  awards granted  modified  or settled after the date of adoption should be measured and accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
r 
unvested equity classified awards that were granted prior to the effective date should continue to be accounted for in accordance with sfas except that amounts must be recognized in the consolidated statements of income 
the company has not accelerated or modified the existing stock option plans to eliminate the recording of stock option expense as required by sfas no 
r 
the unrecognized compensation expense associated with unvested stock options was approximately  as of december   which will be amortized over an average period of approximately years 
the company s fiscal results are expected to include approximately  of additional pre tax compensation expense as a result of the adoption of sfas no

cash and cash equivalents decreased by  from  at december  to  at december   primarily due to our net loss and a decrease in accounts receivable 
liabilities increased approximately  from  at december  to  at december  this increase was primarily due to an increase in deferred warranty revenue and an increase in accounts payable 
we evaluate the collectability of our receivables quarterly 
the allowance for bad debts is based upon specific identification of customer accounts for which collection is doubtful and our estimate of the likelihood of potential loss 
to date  we have experienced only modest credit losses with respect to our accounts receivable 
to date  we have experienced minor inventory write downs  and the reserve is consistent with management s expectations 
we have a history of operating losses and we expect to continue to incur operating losses in the near future as we continue to expend substantial funds for research and development  increased manufacturing activity  expansion of sales and legal and other costs associated with the various government investigations 
the amount and timing of future losses will depend upon  among other things  volume of sales of our existing products  market acceptance of the ultrasound products  and developmental  regulatory and market success of new products under development  as well as our ability to establish  preserve and enforce intellectual property rights related to our products and favorable resolution of the various government investigations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of risks  including changes in interest rates affecting our outstanding debt balance and fixed rate investments of our cash and cash equivalents and foreign currency fluctuations 
the company does not have any market risk with respect to such factors as commodity prices or equity prices 
we do not invest in  or otherwise use  foreign currency or other derivative financial or derivative commodity instruments  and we do not engage in hedging transactions for speculative or trading or any other purposes 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio for our non current debt obligations and our cash and cash equivalents 
at december   we had the laurus convertible note outstanding in the approximate amount of  interest on the laurus convertible note is based on the prime rate 
this floating rate debt may lead to additional interest expense if interest rates increase 
in addition  interest on the note may be higher if our collateral consistency of eligible accounts receivable and the value of our facility are not in access of the amount of the convertible note 
because management does not believe that our exposure to interest rate market risk is material at this time  we have not developed or implemented a strategy to manage this market risk through the use of derivative financial instruments or otherwise 
we will assess the significance of interest rate market risk from time to time and will develop and implement strategies to manage that market risk as appropriate 
we invest our excess cash in money market funds and government securities  which creates a degree of interest rate risk 
our primary exposure to market risk relates to changes in interest rates on our cash and cash equivalents 
our primary investment objective with respect to our cash and cash equivalents is to preserve principal  while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
our portfolio includes money markets funds and or government securities 
the diversity of our portfolio helps us to achieve our investment objective 
as of december   of our investment portfolio matures less than days from the date of purchase 
due to the short term nature of these investments  we believe that we are not subject to any material market risk exposure  and as a result  the estimated fair value of our cash and cash equivalents approximates their principal amounts 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels at december   we estimate that the fair value of investment portfolio would decline by an immaterial amount 
foreign currency risk our international revenues were  and of our total revenues for the year ended december   and  respectively 
our international sales are made through international distributors  our direct sales force and sales to alliance partners  with payments to the company typically denominated in united states dollars and the euro 
approximately of our foreign sales are denominated in the euro 
management believes that the aggregate impact of foreign currency risk is minimal since a majority of our sales are billed in united states dollars 
our international business is subject to risks typical of an international business  including  but not limited to  differing 
table of contents economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely affected by changes in these or other factors 
we do not hedge our foreign currency exposure at present
