overview of performance and company and industry trends 
during  the company accelerated its strategy of creating and building shareholder value through development 
the company began the year positioned to capitalize on the commencement of new development projects and the continuation of projects already under active construction 
at january   the company had no amounts outstanding under its million credit facility  a low debt to total market capitalization ratio of  and available cash and cash equivalents of million 
this strong balance sheet was the result of a recapitalization strategy that began in and included the strategic sale of properties  payment of two special dividends and two perpetual preferred stock offerings 
with the capacity created from this recapitalization  the company began over million in new development projects during the year 
each one of the company s divisions initiated new projects in the office multi family division began the first building in the multi phased project at terminus 
in addition  through a joint venture  the office multi family division began construction of biscayne in miami  as well as continued the construction of juniper 
the retail division began construction of the avenue webb gin  san jose marketcenter and expansions at the avenue west cobb  the avenue viera and viera marketcenter  which combined added  square feet to the company s development pipeline 
the retail division also substantially completed the first phase at the avenue carriage crossing  and the avenue viera became fully operational during the industrial division began its first project  king mill distribution park  in suburban atlanta during the year and  in january  acquired land in jackson county  georgia for its second project  jefferson mill 
the land division began six new residential developments in  located in metropolitan atlanta and texas  through its cl realty  llc venture with temple inland 
depending upon market conditions  the company s strategy calls for it to annually invest million to million in development projects 
years such as provide more opportunities than others  however  the company s diversity and the ability of management to understand and react to changing trends in the real estate markets should improve its ability to continue to develop through the changing real estate cycles 
with its expanded development pipeline  the company will be challenged to deliver these projects on schedule and at the returns expected at the beginning of the projects 
the company believes that it has developed appropriate systems and has experienced development and construction professionals in order to mitigate the risks inherent in the development and leasing process 
the company is also dependent upon certain conditions outside of its control to create value for its shareholders through development 
these conditions include interest rates and the availability of capital to fund its projects 
in addition  the general economic environment for its tenant customers may affect the ability of the company to complete leasing of its developments and may affect the amount of development that the company undertakes in future years 
looking to and beyond  many economists believe that the current low inflation environment will continue for the near term  with good prospects for economic growth 
office markets are improving slowly but steadily  and this trend seems likely to continue throughout the year 
management will continue to monitor 
table of contents the consumer side of the economy for any signs of weakness  but at this point retail demand appears to remain strong 
single family housing also continues to be in high demand in sunbelt markets  and demographics suggest that this trend is likely to continue for a number of years 
the company s residential strategy continues to concentrate on markets with significant population growth and household formation  and to ignore the bubble markets that have received so much attention recently 
industrial absorption has been relatively high in metro atlanta  and the company plans to further grow its industrial division 
the company will continue to be cautious about condominium investments  but management expects to have some opportunities in the next one to three years in this area as well 
in addition  management sees an increasing number of mixed use opportunities in which the company  as a diversified developer  has a competitive advantage 
the company believes that market dynamics and demographic trends will continue to improve for mixed use environments where individuals live  work and seek entertainment 
however  there can be no assurance that these trends will continue 
management expects the current relatively high real estate valuations to decline over time 
while this trend may make it less profitable to dispose of mature income producing assets  thereby making capital recycling more expensive  management believes that its strategy of creating value through development will allow it to compare favorably with other real estate companies who acquire completed properties for income and future market appreciation purposes 
unlike these companies  management believes that if it is successful in identifying development opportunities that meet its underwriting criteria  it can continue to create value for shareholders in higher capitalization rate environments 
the traditional financial metrics for evaluating a reit are funds from operations ffo and ffo growth 
as the company recycles capital from stabilized assets into development projects in order to create value and enhance shareholder returns over the long term  its ffo generally decreases in the short run  as it did from to this reduction in ffo results from either the distribution of capital to shareholders or the redeployment of capital into development assets that will ultimately result in value creation and higher yields  but are not yet producing income 
therefore  management believes that it is important not to place too much emphasis on the traditional ffo measures  but instead to look at the value the company creates through its development and leasing activities and the impact this value creation will have on the company s net asset value 
for the foreseeable future  the company expects to continue to pursue its business model creating value through development  recycling capital to avoid diluting shareholder returns  controlling the size of the company so that development remains a meaningful part of its business strategy  and returning capital to shareholders when it is able to harvest value that exceeds its anticipated capital needs 
management believes that this strategy has been successful in the past and will continue to maximize the total return to shareholders 
critical accounting policies 
our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  and the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item herein include a summary of the significant accounting policies for the company 
a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results of operations and requires significant judgment or complex estimation processes 
the company is in the business of developing  owning and managing office  retail and industrial real estate properties  developing multi family residential units  and developing single family residential communities which are parceled into lots and sold to various home builders 
the company s critical accounting policies relate to cost capitalization  impairment of long lived assets including investments in unconsolidated joint ventures  depreciation and amortization  residential lot and land tract sales profit recognition  multi family sales profit recognition  and valuation of receivables 
cost capitalization 
the company expenses predevelopment costs incurred on a potential project until it becomes probable that the project will go forward 
after a project becomes probable  all subsequently incurred predevelopment costs  as well as interest  real estate taxes and certain internal personnel and associated costs directly related to the project under development  are capitalized 
if the project s probability comes into question  a reserve may be placed on the assets 
if the decision is made to abandon development of 
table of contents a project that had been deemed probable  all previously capitalized costs are expensed or charged against the reserve  if one was established 
therefore  a change in the probability of a project could result in the expensing of significant costs incurred for predevelopment activity 
the company had approximately million of capitalized predevelopment assets as of december  furthermore  if a project is developed  a change in the estimated time and cost of construction could adversely impact the return on the project and the amount of value created from the development of the project 
impairment of long lived assets 
the company periodically evaluates its real estate assets to determine if there has been any impairment in their carrying values and records impairment losses if the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amounts 
the evaluation of real estate assets involves many subjective assumptions dependent upon future economic events that affect the ultimate value of the property 
for example  future cash flows from properties are estimated using expected market rental rates  anticipated leasing results and potential sales results 
a change in assumptions concerning future economic events could result in an adverse change in the value of a property and cause an impairment to be recorded 
the company has analyzed all real estate assets that had indicators of impairment and has determined that the carrying value of all real estate assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets does not exceed undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets 
based on this analysis  no impairment losses were required to be recorded 
unconsolidated joint ventures follow the same impairment assessment of their properties as the company 
additionally  the company evaluates its investments in joint ventures  if indicators warrant the need for a review  utilizing a discounted cash flow calculation 
if the calculation results in a lower amount than the carrying value  the company determines whether the impairment is other than temporary and records an adjustment  if needed 
the company also evaluates its goodwill annually  which requires certain estimates and judgments  specifically related to the fair value of our reporting segments 
based on our analysis  no impairment losses were required to be recorded 
depreciation and amortization 
real estate assets are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful lives using the straight line method of depreciation 
management uses its judgment when estimating the life of the real estate assets and when allocating the cost of acquired properties 
historical data  comparable properties and replacement costs are some of the factors considered in determining useful lives and cost allocations 
if management incorrectly estimates the useful lives of the company s real estate assets or if cost allocations are not appropriate  then depreciation and amortization may not be reflected properly in the company s results of operations 
residential lot and land tract sales 
in its determination of the gross profit recognized on its residential lot or land tract sales  the company utilizes several estimates 
gross profit percentages are calculated based on the estimated lot sales prices and the estimated costs of the development or on the estimated total land tract sales and any estimated development or improvement costs 
the company must estimate the prices of the lots or land tracts to be sold  the costs to complete the development of the residential community or the land improvements and the time period over which the lots or land tracts will ultimately be sold 
if the company s estimated lot or land tract sales or costs of development  or the assumptions underlying either  were to be revised or be rendered inaccurate  it could affect the gross profit percentages and overall profit recognized on these sales 
multi family residential unit sales 
if a certain threshold of deposits are obtained upon sale of a multi family residential unit and other factors are met  the company recognizes profits of multi family residential units on the percentage of completion method 
therefore  sales on these units are recognized before the contract actually closes and before all of the sales price is obtained 
additionally  cost of sales are recognized at a certain percentage during construction of the project which could change significantly during the course of development 
the percentage of completion method involves significant estimates  particularly in determining the profit percentage to be realized on the overall project and the percentage that construction is complete at particular points during the project 
if the company inaccurately estimates costs to construct the project or the estimated profit percentage  actual final results could differ from previously estimated results 

table of contents valuation of receivables 
receivables  including straight line rent receivables  are reported net of an allowance for doubtful accounts and may be uncollectible in the future 
the company reviews its receivables regularly for potential collection problems in computing the allowance recorded against its receivables 
this review process requires the company to make certain judgments regarding collectibility notwithstanding the fact that ultimate collections are inherently difficult to predict 
a change in the judgments made could result in an adjustment to the allowance for doubtful accounts with a corresponding effect to net income

funds from operations 
ffo is a supplemental operating performance measure used in the real estate industry 
prior to  the company calculated ffo in accordance with the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit definition of ffo  which is net income available to common stockholders computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap  excluding extraordinary items  cumulative effect of change in accounting principle and gains or losses from sales of depreciable property  plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures to reflect ffo on the same basis 
for  the company modified its nareit defined calculations of ffo to include million in income from a real estate venture related to the sale of real estate 
the company included this amount in ffo because  based on the nature of the investment  the company believes that  for ffo purposes  this income should not be considered gain on the sale of depreciable property 
ffo is used by industry analysts and investors as a supplemental measure of an equity reit s operating performance 
historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  many industry investors and analysts have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves 
thus  nareit created ffo as a supplemental measure of reit operating performance that excludes historical cost depreciation  among other items  from gaap net income 
the company believes the use of ffo  combined with the required primary gaap presentations  has been fundamentally beneficial  improving the understanding of operating results of reits among the investing public and making comparisons of reit operating results more meaningful 
company management evaluates the operating performance of its reportable 
table of contents segments and of its divisions based on ffo 
additionally  the company uses ffo and ffo per share  along with other measures  to assess performance in connection with evaluating and granting incentive compensation to its officers and employees

however  management does not believe that additional funding of these ventures will have an adverse effect on its financial condition 
the company does not expect to make significant capital contributions to any of its remaining joint ventures
