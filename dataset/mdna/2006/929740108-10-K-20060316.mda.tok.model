in and beyond  we will continue to face many challenges  including increased costs for raw materials  especially steel  higher costs for medical and insurance premiums  and foreign currency fluctuations 
in addition  we face general economic risks  as well as the risk that our customers could curtail spending on new and existing equipment 
risks associated with our four point growth strategy include the level of investment that customers are willing to make in new technologies developed by the industry and the company  and risks inherent in global expansion 
when necessary  we will modify our financial and operating strategies to reflect changes in market conditions and risks

management believes that based on current levels of operations and forecasted earnings  cash flow and liquidity will be sufficient to fund working capital and capital equipment needs as well as meeting debt service requirements 
if sources of funds were to fail to satisfy the company s cash requirements  the company may need to refinance our existing debt or obtain additional financing

critical accounting policies the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make judgments  estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
areas of uncertainty that require judgments  estimates and assumptions include the accounting for derivatives  environmental matters  warranty reserves  the testing of goodwill and other intangibles for impairment  proceeds on assets to be sold  pensions and other postretirement benefits  and tax matters 
management uses historical experience and all available information to make these judgments and estimates  and actual results will inevitably differ from those estimates and assumptions that are used to prepare the company s financial statements at any given time 
despite these inherent limitations  management believes that management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a and the financial statements and related footnotes provide a meaningful and fair perspective of the company 
a discussion of the judgments and uncertainties associated with accounting for derivatives and environmental matters can be found in notes and  respectively  in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part iv  item of this report 
a summary of the company s significant accounting policies is included in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part iv  item of this report 
management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the company to provide the users of the financial statements with useful and reliable information about the company s operating results and financial condition 
description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts the company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts to cover anticipated losses on uncollectible accounts receivable 
the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in our receivable portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience  specific allowances for known troubled accounts and other currently available evidence 
if our estimates regarding the collectibility of troubled accounts  and or our actual losses within our receivable portfolio exceed our historical experience  we may be exposed to the expense of increasing our allowance for doubtful accounts 

table of contents description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
inventory is reviewed to ensure that an adequate provision is recognized for excess  slow moving and obsolete inventories 
cost is determined under the first in  first out fifo method 
inventory costs include material  labor and overhead 
the company compares inventory components to prior year sales history and current backlog and anticipated future requirements 
to the extent that inventory parts exceed estimated usage and demand  a reserve is recognized to reduce the carrying value of inventory 
also  specific reserves are established for known inventory obsolescence 
if the market value of our products were to decrease due to changing market conditions  the company could be at risk of incurring the cost of additional reserves to adjust inventory value to a market value lower than stated cost 
if our estimates regarding sales and backlog requirements are inaccurate  we may be exposed to the expense of increasing our reserves for slow moving and obsolete inventory 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles are required to be tested for impairment at least annually 
the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of the business to the recorded value including goodwill 
we use a combination of a guideline public company market approach and a discounted cash flow model dcf model to determine the current fair value of the business 
a number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the dcf model to forecast operating cash flows  including markets and market share  sales volume and pricing  costs to produce and working capital changes 
management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the fair values of its business are estimated 
however  actual amounts realized may differ from those used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values  we may be exposed to additional impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations 
warranty reserves the company provides warranty reserves to cover expected costs from repairing or replacing products with durability  quality or workmanship issues occurring during established warranty periods 
in general  reserves are provided for as a percentage of sales  based on historical experience 
in addition  specific reserves are established for known warranty issues and their estimable losses 
if actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and judgments used to calculate our warranty liability  the company may be at risk of realizing material gains or losses 

table of contents description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions accounting for pensions and postretirement benefits these amounts are determined using actuarial methodologies and incorporate significant assumptions  including the rate used to discount the future estimated liability  the long term rate of return on plan assets and several assumptions relating to the employee workforce salary increases  medical costs  retirement age and mortality 
significant judgments and estimates are used in determining the liabilities and expenses for pensions and other postretirement benefits 
the rate used to discount future estimated liabilities is determined considering the rates available at year end on debt instruments that could be used to settle the obligations of the plan 
the long term rate of return is estimated by considering historical returns and expected returns on current and projected asset allocations and is generally applied to a five year average market value of assets 
if assumptions used in determining the pension and other postretirement benefits change significantly  these costs can fluctuate materially from period to period 
income taxes as a global company  wabtec records an estimated liability or benefit for income and other taxes based on what it determines will likely be paid in various tax jurisdictions in which it operates 
the estimate of our tax obligations are uncertain because management must use judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions 
management uses its best judgment in the determination of these amounts 
however  the liabilities ultimately realized and paid are dependent on various matters including the resolution of the tax audits in the various affected tax jurisdictions and may differ from the amounts recorded 
an adjustment to the estimated liability would be recorded through income in the period in which it becomes probable that the amount of the actual liability differs from the recorded amount 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized in accordance with staff accounting bulletins sabs  revenue recognition in financial statements and revision of topic revenue is recognized when products have been shipped to the respective customers  title has passed and the price for the product has been determined 
should market conditions and customer demands dictate changes to our standard shipping terms  the company may be impacted by longer than typical revenue recognition cycles 

table of contents description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions the company recognizes revenues on long term contracts based on the percentage of completion method of accounting 
the units of delivery method or other output based measures  as appropriate  are used to measure the progress toward completion of individual contracts 
contract revenues and cost estimates are reviewed and revised at a minimum quarterly and adjustments are reflected in the accounting period as such amounts are determined 
for long term contracts  revenues and cost estimates are reviewed and revised at a minimum quarterly and adjustments are reflected in the accounting period as such amounts are determined 
provisions are made currently for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts 
certain pre production costs relating to long term production and supply contracts have been deferred and will be recognized over the life of the contracts 
pre production costs are recognized over the expected life of the contract usually based on the company s progress toward the estimated number of units expected to be delivered under the production or supply contract 
a charge to expense for unrecognized portions of pre production costs could be realized if the company s estimate of the number of units to be delivered changes or the underlying contract is cancelled

these interest rate swap contracts were terminated in in  we had concluded that our swap contracts qualified for special cash flow hedge accounting which permitted recording the fair value of the swap and corresponding adjustment to other comprehensive income on the balance sheet
