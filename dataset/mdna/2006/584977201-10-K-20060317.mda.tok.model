executive overview we are engaged in distinct but related businesses  which for financial reporting purposes are divided into two reportable segments laboratory services and product sales 
for financial information relating to our segments  
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements in item laboratory services our laboratory services business segment includes the activities of our wholly owned subsidiary  medtox laboratories  inc medtox laboratories  inc 
principally engages in forensic toxicology primarily laboratory testing for identification of drugs of abuse  providing these services to private and public companies  drug treatment counseling centers  occupational health clinics and hospitals  as well as third party administrators 
our specialty laboratory services operations consist of clinical toxicology  clinical testing for the pharmaceutical industry eg  central laboratory services  bioanalytical and pharmacokinetic testing  and analysis of heavy and trace metals 
we provide these services to hospitals  clinics  hmos and small to mid sized biotech and pharmaceutical companies and other laboratories 
testing is conducted using methodologies that include various immunoassays  gas liquid chromatography  gas chromatography mass spectrometry and high performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry 
the laboratory services segment also includes new brighton business center  llc  a wholly owned limited liability company formed for the sole purpose of acquiring the facilities in st 
paul  minnesota  where our laboratory services segment s administrative offices and laboratory operations are located 
these facilities include other commercial tenants that have individual leases with terms of up to ten years 
product sales our product sales business segment consists of our wholly owned subsidiary  medtox diagnostics  inc medtox diagnostics  inc 
is engaged in the development  manufacturing and distribution of a variety of point of collection testing poct diagnostic drug screening devices  such as our profile ii  profile ii a  profile ii er  profile iii  verdict ii  and sure screen products  in addition to a variety of agricultural testing products and other diagnostic tests for the detection of alcohol 
medtox diagnostics  inc also provides contract manufacturing services  such as coagulation market controls 
the operations of the product sales segment are located in burlington  north carolina  where we maintain offices  research and development laboratories  production operations and warehouse distribution facilities 
key trends influencing our operating results our management believes that there are several notable trends that are currently influencing  and are expected in the foreseeable future to continue to influence  our operating results 
these include consolidation in the laboratory services drugs of abuse business the laboratory services drugs of abuse industry is consolidating  with the consolidation being driven by customers desires to minimize the number of laboratories they work with  the need for operating efficiencies in the form of critical mass testing volumes  required investment levels and government regulation 
given the competitive environment  we are increasingly seeking to differentiate ourselves through our technology and value added services  such as data management  collection site management  training  and technical support and expertise 
increased poct diagnostic device test competition we have experienced increased competition with respect to our poct diagnostic tests from systems and products developed by others  many of whom compete solely on price 
as the number of firms marketing diagnostic tests has grown  we have experienced increased price competition for certain diagnostic testing devices  particularly in the probation  parole and rehabilitation market 
our strategy we believe that the combined operations of our laboratory services business and on site test kits manufactured by the product sales segment have created synergy in the marketing of comprehensive  on site and laboratory testing programs to a common customer base 
our management has positioned us to offer a full line of products and services for the substance abuse testing and occupational medicine marketplace  including on site tests for the detection of substance of abuse drugs  substance abuse mental health services administration samhsa certified laboratory testing screening and confirmation  biological monitoring of occupational toxins  consultation  and logistics  data management and program management services 
our strategy is to build market share by offering the highest quality products and services  delivered rapidly  priced competitively and supported by value added services for customers 
these services include data management  collection site management  training  technical support and expertise  as well as policy review 
in the data management area  we have a new service echain  the first multi purpose electronic chain of custody system in the market 
we have initiated deployment of echain and we anticipate it to be in use in more than  specimen collection sites in also in development is medtoxscan  an electronic reader for our devices for use in hospital laboratories and emergency rooms 
production units of medtoxscan are currently expected to be available in the first half of in may  we introduced sure screen  a cup based poct device with significantly lower detection levels for eight drugs of abuse  into the forensic markets where fda k marketing clearance is not required 
in october  we received fda k clearance for our sure screen device and will now be able to expand the markets into which it is sold 
specific markets to which sure screen are targeted are probation  parole  drug rehabilitation  hospital emergency departments  medical clinics  laboratories  and corporate clients interested in lower detection levels for pre employment testing 
in the fourth quarter of  we introduced the profile iii device  an integrated cup and testing device for sale to the workplace drug testing market 
this new device is in the same format as sure screen 
we have committed to improve productivity and quality in our organization through lean and six sigma processes 
our lean and six sigma initiatives are designed to improve quality and productivity  cut costs and increase throughput 
while all key departments in the laboratory services and product sales segments have now been through initial lean processes  as an organization we recognize that lean is an ongoing philosophy  not a project to be finished 
lean is a highly disciplined process that helps us focus on reducing waste and eliminating unnecessary steps in our business processes 
our six sigma initiatives address quality and variability in processes 
critical accounting policies we have identified the policies outlined below as critical to understanding our business and results of operations 
the listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on the company s business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements in item note that the preparation of this annual report on form k requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
our critical accounting policies are as follows accounts receivable we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customers current creditworthiness  as determined by management s review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified 
while such credit losses have generally been within our historical expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that have occurred in the past 
our consolidated trade accounts receivable balance at december  was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of million 
some of our laboratory services revenues for certain types of tests are billed to third party payors including insurance companies  state medicaid and medicare agencies 
these payors pay for such services at established amounts  which are typically lower than gross amounts billed by us 
however  the tests are sometimes billed directly to patients or other parties and paid at the gross amount billed for these tests 
in addition  billings for the tests are occasionally re billed to alternative payors in situations where incorrect billing information was submitted to us by the customer 
we estimate a discount on the billings for these tests  and recognize revenue and related accounts receivable at a net amount  after discount  in order to state revenue and accounts receivable at the amount expected to be paid 
while we believe that estimated discounts and the related net revenue and net accounts receivable from these testing services are materially correct  there can be differences in amounts ultimately paid compared to estimated amounts 
these differences are recorded upon payment and may affect previously recorded amounts 
we consider contracted rates with payors and historical discounts when estimating future discounts on a monthly basis 
off site supplies inventory off site supplies represent collection kits and forms located at collections sites throughout the united states used by laboratory services customers to submit specimens for testing services 
at december   off site inventory was million 
the process for valuing off site inventory involves making significant assumptions regarding the average time that a collection site uses the inventory  as well as the amount of inventory expected to be scrapped 
goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized  but are instead reviewed for impairment at least annually and between annual test dates in certain circumstances 
we perform our annual impairment test for goodwill and other intangible assets in the fourth quarter of each year 
no impairments were indicated as a result of our annual impairment reviews for goodwill and other intangible assets in  or in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets  projections regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors are made to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or related projections change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets in future periods 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we must then assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and tax planning strategies  and to the extent management believes that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we increase or decrease the valuation allowance in a period  we must include an expense or benefit within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
our deferred tax assets primarily consist of certain net operating losses nols carried forward 
at december   we had a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets of approximately  which represents the portion of certain state nol carryforwards that will more likely than not expire unused in future years 
the valuation allowance is based on management s estimate of future taxable income and the period over which nols will be recoverable 
in the future  subsequent revisions to the estimated net realizable value of these deferred tax assets could cause the provision for income taxes to vary significantly from period to period  although our cash payments would remain unaffected until the benefit of the nols is completely utilized or expires unused 
results of operations in evaluating our financial performance  our management has primarily focused on three objectives maximizing operating income  increasing our cash flows and improving our balance sheet 
the first of these objectives is discussed in this section 
the other two are addressed under liquidity and capital resources 
to maximize our operating income  we have sought revenue growth  improved gross margins and reduced selling  general and administrative sg a expense as a percentage of revenues 
as discussed below  during we made positive strides on all three fronts 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues year ended december year over year of revenues of revenues change change revenues laboratory services product sales our laboratory services segment includes revenues from workplace drugs of abuse testing and revenues from specialty laboratory services 
our revenues from workplace drugs of abuse testing grew due to an increase in sample volume  partially offset by a slight decrease in the average price per testing specimen 
pricing for our workplace drugs of abuse testing services tends to be stable overall  however  the average price per testing specimen can vary slightly from quarter to quarter 
test price can vary by client based on the amount of confirmation testing and transportation charges associated with the client s workplace drugs of abuse samples 
our increased sample volume was from both new and existing customers across a broad customer base and resulted from the execution of our business strategy 
during the fourth quarter of  we initiated deployment of our echain web based system  capable of delivering enhanced electronic results reporting  as well as sample and donor tracking 
we anticipate that echain will be in use in more than  specimen collection sites in revenues from our specialty laboratory services increased to million due to strong growth in testing for our clinical trial services 
while we continue to add new clients in clinical trial services  we are also experiencing significant repeat business from existing clients 
overall  our clinical trial services have experienced growth quarter over quarter during however  revenues from these services can fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending on the actual timing of clinical trials 
in the product sales segment  sales of poct products  which consists of the profile ii  profile ii er  profile ii a  profile iii  verdict ii and sure screen on site test kits and other ancillary products for the detection of abused substances  increased to million in this growth reflected strong sales of profile ii products and solid gains later in the year in the government and rehabilitation markets as our new lower detection poct device sure screen begins to have a positive impact on sales in those markets 
in late  we also introduced our profile iii cup product which tests at standard samhsa sensitivity levels and is targeted at the corporate  occupational health and hospital laboratory markets 
overall  pricing for our poct devices was stable year over year 
sales of contract manufacturing services and associated products decreased to million in and were impacted by the timing of the placement of orders from our two existing clients for these services 
product sales from other diagnostic products were down  or  due to decreased purchases of agricultural diagnostic products by the us department of agriculture usda 
the usda s need for our products varies from year to year and sales to the usda are expected to fluctuate accordingly 
gross profit year ended december year over year of revenues of revenues change change cost of revenues cost of services cost of sales cost of services as a percentage of laboratory services revenues cost of sales as a percentage of product sales revenues consolidated gross margin increased to of revenues in  compared to of revenues in the increase was driven by improvement in laboratory services gross margin  partially offset by a decline in product sales gross margin 
laboratory services gross margin was in  up from in the margin improvement was attributable to increased revenues from additional testing volume through our existing infrastructure 
we also continued the implementation of lean initiatives within our specialty laboratory services operations 
gross margin from product sales declined to in  down from in  largely due to the impact of costs associated with the transition to an enhanced product format for our profile ii product line during the first half of the enhanced product began shipping late in the first quarter of we also continued the implementation of lean initiatives in our manufacturing processes within our product sales segment 
operating expenses year ended december year over year of revenues of revenues change change operating expenses selling  general and administrative research and development operating expenses increased in  but as a percentage of revenues were down slightly 
the increase reflected a continued increased investment in sales and marketing  information technology and research and development activities 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million  or of revenues in  compared to million  or in the lower percentage reflects the increase in revenue on marginally higher year over year expenses 
the increase in spending was primarily associated with higher performance based compensation such as executive deferred compensation expense and sales commissions based on our financial performance  as well as increased spending in information technology 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased million  or  to million in  primarily due to continued spending for significant development projects in our product sales segment 
during  we completed enhancements to our profile ii  profile ii a  and profile ii er products that shorten run times  darken line intensity  improve readability and extend the positive result hold time 
we received fda k clearance for sure screen 
we also made substantial progress on development of an electronic reader medtoxscan expected to be utilized with our devices in the hospital laboratory and emergency room markets 
production units of medtoxscan are scheduled to be available late in the first half of other expense other income and expense consists primarily of interest expense and the net expenses associated with our building rental activities 
these expenses were million in  a decrease of compared to the slight decline was primarily due to lower interest expense  reflecting a reduction in average debt levels  partially offset by reduced net operating results from our building rental activities 
income taxes in  we recorded million in income tax expense  or an effective rate of  compared to an effective rate of in the lower rate in was caused primarily by a million reduction in our valuation allowance on deferred tax assets 
the reduction in the valuation allowance was based on the available evidence  including our recent historical performance and projected future results 
at december   we had a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets of approximately  which represents the portion of certain state net operating loss nol carryforwards that will more likely than not expire unused in future years 
should operating results in and future years differ from expectations  the valuation allowance against the nol carryforwards and the related deferred tax asset may require adjustment in future periods 
the reduction in income tax expense from the valuation allowance change was partially offset by a charge of million related to a north carolina department of revenue examination of medtox diagnostics  inc year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues year ended december year over year of revenues of revenues change change revenues laboratory services product sales in the laboratory services segment  revenues in from our workplace and occupational health clients grew over the prior year due to increased sample volume from both new and existing clients 
we were also able to benefit from consolidation in the drugs of abuse market  leaving fewer competitors able to compete on a national level 
revenues from our specialty laboratory services were essentially flat with in the product sales segment  sales of poct devices  which incorporate the profile ii  profile ii er  profile ii a and verdict ii on site test kits and other ancillary products for the detection of abused substances  increased to million in this growth reflected strong sales of profile ii products  which grew from however  sales within the verdict ii product line to government clients for probation  parole and rehabilitation were down from in  we continued the introduction of a proprietary value added service called dars drug abuse recognition system in the government workplace and have identified numerous state and county agencies interested in program implementation 
the implementation of dars to new clients helped offset additional revenue declines of verdict ii products caused by constraints on state budgets for drug testing services 
sales of our contract manufacturing services increased to million in and were positively impacted by the timing of orders from existing clients 
product sales from other diagnostic products were down  or  due to decreased purchases of agricultural diagnostic products by the usda 
the usda s needs our products vary from year to year and sales to the usda are expected to fluctuate accordingly 
gross profit year ended december year over year of revenues of revenues change change cost of revenues cost of services cost of sales cost of services as a percentage of laboratory services revenues cost of sales as a percentage of product sales revenues consolidated gross margin increased to of revenues in from in  driven by improvement in both laboratory services and product sales gross margins 
laboratory services gross margin was in  up from in the margin improvement was attributable to increased revenue spread over relatively stable fixed costs  as well as improved operating efficiencies realized from the implementation of lean in the drugs of abuse testing laboratory 
we also initiated lean within our specialty laboratory services in  with implementation expected in gross margin from product sales improved to in  from in  largely due to the impact of fixed type costs on increased production levels 
we also implemented lean initiatives across multiple areas of our diagnostic products operations in which improved efficiency and productivity 
operating expenses year ended december year over year of revenues of revenues change change operating expenses selling  general and administrative research and development operating expenses increased in compared to the prior year  but were down as a percentage of revenues 
the increase reflected higher performance based compensation such as bonuses and sales commissions  increased depreciation expense and increased spending in information technology 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in the increase in spending was primarily associated with higher performance based compensation such as bonuses and sales commissions based on our financial performance  increased depreciation expense related to capital improvements to improve operating efficiencies in connection with our initiatives  and increased spending in information technology 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses in decreased million  or  to million 
in  we incurred recruiting and hiring costs associated with the addition of a new vice president of technology  research and development at our product sales segment  as well as severance and other costs associated with the reorganization of the department 
other expense other income and expense consists primarily of interest expense and the net expenses associated with our building rental activities 
these expenses decreased to million in the decrease was primarily due to a reduction in interest expense of million  reflecting lower average debt levels 
the decrease was also due to increased rental income as a result of lower vacancy rates 
income taxes we recorded a tax provision for based upon an effective tax rate of 
we did not record a tax provision or benefit for at december   we had a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets of million 
liquidity and capital resources our working capital requirements have been funded primarily by various combinations of profitable operations  cash received from debt financing  and the sale of equity securities 
cash and cash equivalents at december  were million  compared to million at december  net cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to million and million in and  respectively 
the increase in was primarily due to an improvement in our operating results as well as an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses  partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable 
accounts payable and accrued expenses increased million in compared to a reduction of million in the increase in was primarily due to the timing of payments as well as an overall increase in revenues 
accounts receivable increased million in compared to an increase of million in the significant increase in accounts receivable in was primarily due to strong sales in november and december and the timing of cash receipts 
our days sales outstanding was days at both december  and the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in over was primarily due to an improvement in operating results as well as a smaller decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
net cash used in investing activities  consisting primarily of capital expenditures  was million in compared to million and million in and  respectively 
the increased spending in from reflected equipment purchased and costs incurred in redesigning the laboratory operations to improve operating efficiencies in connection with our lean initiatives 
we expect equipment and capital improvement expenditures to be between million and million in these expenditures are intended primarily to continue to improve efficiencies and reduce operating costs within our laboratory services and product sales businesses 
such expenditures are expected to be funded through borrowings under our credit facilities and cash provided by operating activities 
net cash used in financing activities was million in  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
in  we received proceeds of approximately million from the exercise of warrants to acquire  common shares issued in connection with our private placements in july and august the proceeds received from the exercise of these warrants were used to reduce the amount outstanding on our revolving credit facility 
in july or august  warrants exercisable for an aggregate of  shares expired without being exercised 
in  we purchased  shares of our common stock in the open market and  shares of our common stock from an officer of our company for a total cost of  the acquired stock was contributed to our long term incentive plan 
we also made payments on long term debt of million  million and million during  and  respectively 
the increase in net cash used in financing activities in over was primarily the result of payments on the revolving credit facility and a reduction in new financing activity in on december   we entered into a credit agreement the wells fargo credit agreement with wells fargo bank  national association the bank  which replaced the existing amended and restated credit and security agreement with wells fargo business credit  inc the wells fargo credit agreement consists of i a revolving line of credit line of credit  payable on demand  of up to million bearing interest at either a fluctuating rate of below the bank s prime rate or at a fixed rate of above libor  as defined and calculated by the bank  in effect on the first day of the applicable fixed rate term  and ii a note or notes aggregating up to million loan limit for the purchase of capital equipment bearing interest at either a rate of below the bank s prime rate or at a fixed rate for a period of one  two  three or four years at a rate of in excess of the then current yield on us treasury securities  adjusted to a constant maturity equal to such fixed rate period 
subject to certain conditions  the wells fargo credit agreement also provides for the issuance of letters of credit which  if drawn upon  would be deemed advances under the line of credit 
we are required to pay a fee equal to per annum on the average daily unused amount of the line of credit 
we have granted the bank a first priority security interest in all of the company s accounts receivable  other rights to payment  general intangibles  inventory and equipment to secure all indebtedness of the company to the bank 
extensions of credit under the wells fargo credit agreement are subject to certain conditions 
the wells fargo agreement also requires us to comply with certain financial covenants  including maintaining  on a consolidated basis a current ratio not less than to at any time  with current ratio defined as total current assets divided by total current liabilities 
tangible net worth not less than  at any time  with tangible net worth defined as the aggregate of total stockholders equity plus subordinated debt less any intangible assets 
total liabilities divided by tangible net worth not greater than to at any time  with total liabilities defined as the aggregate of current liabilities and non current liabilities less subordinated debt  and with tangible net worth as defined above 
a debt service coverage ratio not less than to as of each fiscal quarter end  determined on a rolling four quarter basis  with debt service coverage ratio defined as the aggregate of net income before non cash tax expense plus depreciation expense and amortization expense  divided by the aggregate of the current maturity of long term debt for the previous four fiscal quarters plus current capital lease obligations for the previous four fiscal quarters 
on december   we entered into a term loan with the bank which was used to repay existing capital expenditure advances made in and under the amended and restated credit and security agreement with wells fargo business credit  inc the december  term note was made pursuant to and subject to the terms and conditions of the wells fargo credit agreement under the million loan limit 
the term note was for approximately  payable in monthly installments over three years bearing interest at a rate of below the bank s prime rate 
the term loan is secured by the equipment purchased with the proceeds from the and capital expenditure advances 
on march   we entered into a term note the note with the bank to refinance  on march   a portion of the outstanding balance of million on our mortgage loan with principal life insurance company principal 
we financed the march purchase of the building complex where our laboratory services segment and other commercial tenants are located with the mortgage loan from principal 
the mortgage loan has a term of ten years and is being repaid based on a year amortization schedule at a fixed interest rate of for the first five years 
in accordance with the provisions of the mortgage loan  principal had the option to adjust the interest rate  effective march   or to call the loan due on march  we elected not to accept the interest rate adjustment and will refinance million with the bank over a five year term in monthly installments of approximately  plus interest  commencing may  interest will be calculated at either i a variable rate of below the prime rate or ii a fixed rate of above libor in effect on the first day of the applicable fixed rate term 
we will refinance the remaining outstanding mortgage loan balance of approximately million with a portion of our line of credit from the bank 
we are relying on expected positive cash flow from operations and our line of credit to fund our future working capital and asset purchases 
at december   we had total borrowing capacity of million on our line of credit 
we did not have an outstanding balance on the line of credit at december  in the short term  we believe that the aforementioned resources will be sufficient to fund our planned operations through while there can be no assurance that the available capital will be sufficient to fund our future operations beyond  we believe that future profitable operations  as well as access to additional capital through debt or equity financings  will be the primary means for funding our operations for the long term 
we continue to follow a plan which includes i aggressively monitoring and controlling costs  ii increasing revenue from sales of the our existing products and services iii developing new products and services  as well as iv selectively pursuing synergistic acquisitions to increase our critical mass 
however  there can be no assurance that costs can be controlled  revenues can be increased  financing may be obtained  acquisitions successfully consummated  or that we will be profitable 
disclosures about contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table aggregates all contractual commitments and commercial obligations that affect the company s financial condition and liquidity position at december  payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years more than years long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases total contractual obligations the following revised table aggregates all contractual commitments and commercial obligations that affect the company s financial condition and liquidity position at december   giving effect to the refinancing of long term debt entered into on march  discussed in the liquidity and capital resources section above 
payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years more than years long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases total contractual obligations amounts include interest payments based upon contractual or prevailing interest rates 
off balance sheet transactions we do not maintain any off balance sheet transactions  arrangements  obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or others that are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
impact of inflation and changing prices the impact of inflation and changing prices has been primarily limited to salary  laboratory and operating supplies and rent increases and has historically not been material to our operations 
in the future  we may not be able to increase the prices of laboratory testing by an amount sufficient to cover the cost of inflation  although we are responding to these concerns by offering the highest quality products and services  delivered rapidly  priced competitively and supported by value added services for customers 
seasonality we believe that the laboratory testing business is subject to seasonal fluctuations in pre employment screening 
these seasonal fluctuations include reduced volume in the summer months  year end holiday periods  and other major holidays 
in addition  inclement weather may have a negative impact on volume thereby reducing net revenues and cash flow 
impact of new accounting standards in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
sfas no 
requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements for changes in accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
sfas no 
also requires that retrospective application of a change in accounting principle be limited to the direct effects of the change 
indirect effects of a change in accounting principle  such as a change in non discretionary profit sharing payments resulting from an accounting change  should be recognized in the period of the accounting change 
sfas no 
also requires that a change in depreciation  amortization  or depletion method for long lived  non financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle 
sfas no 
will be effective for us on january  in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
sfas no 
r supersedes apbo no 
and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
the revision requires companies to measure and recognize compensation expense for all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  in the financial statements based on the fair value at the date of the grant 
sfas no 
r permits companies to adopt its requirements using either the modified prospective method or the modified retrospective method 
under the modified prospective method  compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date for all share based payments granted after the effective date and for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas no 
r that remain unvested on the effective date 
the modified retrospective method includes the requirements of the modified prospective method  but also permits entities to restate either all prior periods presented or prior interim periods of the year of adoption for the impact of adopting this standard 
we will apply the modified prospective method upon adoption 
in april  the securities and exchange commission announced it would provide for phased in implementation of sfas no 
r 
as a result  sfas no 
r is effective for the first interim or annual reporting period of the registrant s first fiscal year beginning on or after june  we estimate that compensation expense related to employee stock options for will be in the range of  to  sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation costs to be reported as financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
we believe this reclassification will not have a material impact on our consolidated statements of cash flows 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas no 
requires that abnormal amounts of idle capacity and spoilage costs should be excluded from the cost of inventory and expensed when incurred 
sfas no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk that we will incur losses due to adverse changes in interest rates or currency exchange rates and prices 
our primary market risk exposures are to changes in interest rates 
during   and  we did not have sales denominated in foreign currencies nor did we have any subsidiaries located in foreign countries 
as such  we are not exposed to market risk associated with currency exchange rates and prices 
at december   we had a million mortgage loan payable to principal at a fixed annual rate of 
in accordance with the provisions of the loan  principal had the option to adjust the interest rate  effective march   or to call the loan due on march  we elected not to accept the interest rate adjustment and will repay the outstanding balance of million on march  we will be refinancing with wells fargo bank over a five year term bearing interest at either i a variable rate of below the prime rate or ii a fixed rate of above libor in effect on the first day of the applicable fixed rate term 
at december  we had capital leases totaling  at various fixed rates 
these fixed rate financial instruments are subject to interest rate risk and will increase or decrease in value if market interest rates change 
changes in market interest rates would not impact our cash obligations under fixed rate debt 
at december   we had approximately million in long term debt outstanding under the wells fargo credit agreement 
at december   we had approximately million outstanding under our line of credit and long term debt issued under the amended and restated credit and security agreement with wells fargo business credit 
the debt under the wells fargo credit agreement has variable interest rates 
we have cash flow exposure on our committed and uncommitted line of credit and long term debt due to its variable prime rate pricing 
at december   a change in the prime rate would increase or decrease interest expense or cash flows by less than million 
we do not enter into derivative or other financial instruments or hedging transactions for trading or speculative purposes
