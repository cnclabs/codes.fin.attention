overview of earnings performance in  the net income of the company was million  or  per basic share and per diluted share compared to million  or  per basic share and per diluted share for this represents a million increase in net income over the primary reason for the increase is the million net interest margin improvement  as the company increased its volume of earning assets while also experiencing widening margins 
this was accomplished despite a challenging economic and interest rate environment in the banking industry 
the company had a decrease in non interest income  primarily due to its discretionary decision to sell fewer sba a loans 
the other predominant factor contributing to positive earnings is the control of non interest expenses  despite the asset growth 
the company s earnings performance was also impacted in by net loan portfolio growth of million  or  primarily in commercial  commercial real estate  manufactured housing and sba loans  resolution of a potential tax issue which resulted in a reversal of a reserve and positively impacted net income  continued prepayments of the securitized loans and the payoff of the securitized bonds  impacting interest income  interest expense  provision for loan losses and other non interest expenses  basis point increase in the federal reserve board s target overnight interest rate from to  positively impacting net interest income  although  the yield curve flattening served to compress margins  strategic decision to reduce sba loan sales which negatively impacted the related gains on loan sales  but will help grow the balance sheet and enhance future interest income  fewer mortgage loan originations  which negatively impacted loan fees and gain on loan sales 
the impact to the company from these items  and others of both a positive and negative nature  will be discussed in more detail as they pertain to the company s overall comparative performance for throughout the analysis sections of this report 
critical accounting policies the company s accounting policies are more fully described in note of the consolidated financial statements 
as disclosed in note  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
the company believes that the following discussion addresses the company s most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
provision and allowance for loan losses the company maintains a detailed  systematic analysis and procedural discipline to determine the amount of the allowance for loan losses all 
the all is based on estimates and is intended to be adequate to provide for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
this process involves deriving probable loss estimates that are based on individual loan loss estimation  migration analysis historical loss rates and management s judgment 
the company employs several methodologies for estimating probable losses 
methodologies are determined based on a number of factors  including type of asset  risk rating  concentrations  collateral value and the input of the special assets group  functioning as a workout unit 
the all calculation for the different major loan types is as follows sba all loans are reviewed and classified loans are assigned a specific allowance 
those not classified are assigned a pass rating 
a migration analysis and various portfolio specific factors are used to calculate the required allowance on those pass loans 
relationship banking includes commercial  commercial real estate and consumer loans 
classified loans are assigned a specific allowance 
a migration analysis and various portfolio specific factors are used to calculate the required allowance on the remaining pass loans 
manufactured housing an allowance is calculated on the basis of risk rating  which is a combination of delinquency  value of collateral on classified loans and perceived risk in the product line 
securitized loans the company considers this a homogeneous portfolio and calculates the allowance based on statistical information provided by the servicer 
charge off history is calculated based on three methodologies  a month and a month historical trend and by delinquency information 
the highest allowance requirement of the three methods is used 
the company calculates the required all on a monthly basis 
any difference between estimated and actual observed losses from the prior month are reflected in the current period required all calculation and adjusted as deemed necessary 
the review of the adequacy of the allowance takes into consideration such factors as concentrations of credit  changes in the growth  size and composition of the loan portfolio  overall and individual portfolio quality  review of specific problem loans  collateral  guarantees and economic conditions that may affect the borrowers ability to pay and or the value of the underlying collateral 
additional factors considered include geographic location of borrowers  changes in the company s product specific credit policy and lending staff experience 
these estimates depend on the outcome of future events and  therefore  contain inherent uncertainties 
the company s all is maintained at a level believed adequate by management to absorb known and inherent probable losses on existing loans 
a provision for loan losses is charged to expense 
the allowance is charged for losses when management believes that full recovery on the loan is unlikely 
generally  the company charges off any loan classified as a loss  portions of loans which are deemed to be uncollectible  overdrafts which have been outstanding for more than days  and  all other unsecured loans past due or more days 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the all 
interest only strips and servicing rights the guaranteed portion of certain sba loans can be sold into the secondary market 
servicing rights are recognized at fair market value as separate assets when loans are sold with servicing retained 
servicing rights are amortized in proportion to  and over the period of  estimated future net servicing income 
also  at the time of the loan sale  it is the company s policy to recognize the related gain on the loan sale in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the company uses industry prepayment statistics and its own prepayment experience in estimating the expected life of the loans 
management periodically evaluates servicing rights for impairment 
servicing rights are evaluated for impairment based upon the fair value of the rights as compared to amortized cost on a loan by loan basis 
fair value is determined using discounted future cash flows calculated on a loan by loan basis and aggregated to the total asset level 
the initial servicing rights and resulting gain on sale are calculated based on the difference between the best actual par and premium bids on an individual loan basis 
additionally  on certain sba loan sales that occurred prior to  the company retained interest only strips i o strips  which represent the present value of excess net cash flows generated by the difference between a interest at the stated rate paid by borrowers and b the sum of i pass through interest paid to third party investors and ii contractual servicing fees 
the i o strips are classified as trading securities 
accordingly  the company records the i o strips at fair value with the resulting increase or decrease in fair value being recorded through operations in the current period 
quarterly  the company verifies the reasonableness of its valuation estimates by comparison to the results of an independent third party valuation analysis 
other real estate owned other real estate owned oreo is real estate acquired through foreclosure on the collateral property and is recorded at fair value at the time of foreclosure less estimated costs to sell 
any excess of loan balance over the fair value of the oreo is charged off against the all 
subsequent to foreclosure  management periodically performs a new valuation and the asset is carried at the lower of carrying amount or fair value 
operating expenses or income  and gains or losses on disposition of such properties  are charged or credited to current operations 
stock based compensation until the effective date of sfas  january   gaap permitted the company to use either of two methodologies to account for compensation cost in connection with employee stock options 
the first method required issuers to record compensation expense over the period the options were expected to be outstanding prior to exercise  expiration or cancellation 
the amount of compensation expense to be recognized over this term is the fair value of the options at the time of the grant as determined by the black scholes valuation model 
black scholes computed fair value of the options based on the length of their term  the volatility of the stock price in past periods and other factors 
under this method  the issuer recognized compensation expense regardless of whether or not the employee eventually exercised the options 
under the second methodology  if options are granted at an exercise price equal to the market value of the stock at the time of the grant  no compensation expense was recognized 
gaap required that issuers electing the second method present pro forma disclosure of net income loss and earnings per share as if the first method had been elected 
under the terms of the company s stock option plan  full time salaried employees may be granted qualified stock options or incentive stock options and directors may be granted nonqualified stock options 
options may be granted at a price not less than of the market value of the stock on the date of grant 
qualified options are generally exercisable in cumulative installments 
all options expire no later than ten years from the date of grant 
recent accounting pronouncements pending adoption statement of financial accounting standards no 
r sfas no 
revised sfas no 
r  share based payment  is a revision of sfas no 
and supersedes apb opinion no 
and its related implementation guidance 
the statement focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
sfas no 
r requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award with limited exceptions 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
on march   the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab no 
 which provides the staff s views regarding interactions between sfas no 
r and certain sec rules and regulations and provides interpretations of the valuation of share based payments for public companies 
sfas no 
r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas no 
r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas no 
for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas no 
r that remain unvested on the effective date 
a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas no 
for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
this statement is effective for the beginning of the first annual reporting period that begins after june  therefore  we will adopt the standard in the first quarter of using the modified prospective method 
as permitted by sfas no 
 we currently account for share based payments to employees using the intrinsic value method prescribed in apb no 
and  as such  generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
the effect on our results of operations of expensing stock options using the black scholes method is presented in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in the note  entitled stockholder s equity 
sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption changes in interest income and interest expense the company primarily earns income from the management of its financial assets and liabilities and from charging fees for services it provides 
the company s income from managing assets consists of the difference between the interest income received from its loan portfolio and investments and the interest expense paid on its funding sources  primarily interest paid on deposits 
this difference or spread is net interest income 
the amount by which interest income will exceed interest expense depends on the volume or balance of earning assets compared to the volume or balance of interest bearing deposits and liabilities and the interest rate earned on those interest earning assets compared to the interest rate paid on those interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income  when expressed as a percentage of average total interest earning assets  is referred to as net interest margin on interest earning assets 
the company s net interest income is affected by the change in the level and the mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  referred to as volume changes 
the company s net yield on interest earning assets is also affected by changes in the yields earned on assets and rates paid on liabilities  referred to as rate changes 
interest rates charged on the company s loans are affected principally by the demand for such loans  the supply of money available for lending purposes  competitive factors and general economic conditions such as federal economic policies  legislative tax policies and governmental budgetary matters 
to maintain its net interest margin  the company must manage the relationship between interest earned and paid

net loans charged off were  in  million in and million in the primary reason for the decline in net loan charge offs in was the paydown in the securitized loan portfolio of million  or  from million at year end to million at year end the company recorded  as a provision for loan losses in   in and million in the moderate increase in over is due to loan growth in most categories offset by the continued paydown in the securitized loan portfolio 
in management s opinion  the balance of the allowance for loan losses was sufficient to absorb known and inherent probable losses in the loan portfolio as of december  nonaccrual  past due and restructured loans a loan is considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest under the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status  collateral value and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments 
loans that experience insignificant payment delays or payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired 
management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case by case basis 
when determining the possibility of impairment  management considers the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower  including the length of the delay  the reasons for the delay  the borrower s prior payment record and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed 
for collateral dependent loans  the company uses the fair value of collateral method to measure impairment 
all other loans  except for securitized  are measured for impairment based on the present value of future cash flows 
impairment is measured on a loan by loan basis for all loans in the portfolio except for the securitized loans  which are evaluated for impairment on a collective basis 
the recorded investment in loans that are considered to be impaired is as follows year ended december  in thousands impaired loans without specific valuation allowances impaired loans with specific valuation allowances      specific valuation allowance related to impaired loans   impaired loans  net      average investment in impaired loans      the following schedule reflects recorded investment at the dates indicated in certain types of loans year ended december  in thousands nonaccrual loans      sba guaranteed portion of loans included above      nonaccrual loans  net      troubled debt restructured loans  loans through days past due with interest accruing      interest income recognized on impaired loans  interest foregone on nonaccrual loans and troubled debt restructured loans outstanding   gross interest income on impaired loans   the accrual of interest is discontinued when substantial doubt exists as to collectibility of the loan  generally at the time the loan is days delinquent 
any unpaid but accrued interest is reversed at that time 
thereafter  interest income is no longer recognized on the loan 
as such  interest income may be recognized on impaired loans to the extent they are not past due by days 
interest on nonaccrual loans is accounted for on the cash basis or cost recovery method  until qualifying for return to accrual 
loans are returned to accrual status when all of the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured 
all of the nonaccrual loans are impaired

there have been no new i o s since these i o s represent the present value of the right to the estimated net cash flows generated by sba loans sold 
net cash flows consist of the difference between a interest at the stated rate paid by borrowers and b the sum of i pass through interest paid to third party investors and ii contractual servicing fees 
the company also held servicing rights related to sba loans sales of million and million at december  and  respectively 
for loans sold subsequent to march   the initial servicing rights and resulting gain on sale were calculated based on the difference between the best actual par and premium bids on an individual loan basis 
the servicing right balances are subsequently amortized over the estimated life of the loans using industry prepayment statistics and the company s own experience 
quarterly  the servicing right and i o strip assets are analyzed for impairment 
the i o s are accounted for as investments in debt securities classified as trading securities 
accordingly  the company marks them to fair value with the resulting increase or decrease recorded through operations in the current period 
at december  and  all of the servicing rights were related to sba loan sales 
liquidity management the company has established policies as well as analytical tools to manage liquidity 
proper liquidity management ensures that sufficient funds are available to meet normal operating demands in addition to unexpected customer demand for funds  such as high levels of deposit withdrawals or increased loan demand  in a timely and cost effective manner 
the most important factor in the preservation of liquidity is maintaining public confidence that facilitates the retention and growth of core deposits 
ultimately  public confidence is gained through profitable operations  sound credit quality and a strong capital position 
the company s liquidity management is viewed from a long term and short term perspective  as well as from an asset and liability perspective 
management monitors liquidity through regular reviews of maturity profiles  funding sources and loan and deposit forecasts to minimize funding risk 
the company has asset liability committees alco at the board and bank management level to review asset liability management and liquidity issues 
the company maintains strategic liquidity and contingency plans 
periodically  the company has used short term time certificates from other financial institutions to meet projected liquidity needs 
in  cwb was approved for membership in the federal home loan bank fhlb 
the company has a blanket lien credit line with the fhlb 
advances are collateralized in the aggregate by cwb s eligible mortgage loans and securities of the u 
s government and its agencies 
the outstanding advances at december  include million borrowed at variable rates which adjust to the current libor rate either monthly or quarterly and million borrowed at fixed rates 
at december   cwb had pledged to fhlb  securities of million at carrying value and loans of million  and had million available for additional borrowing at december   cwb had million of loans and million of securities pledged as collateral and outstanding advances of million 
the company also maintains three federal funds purchased lines for a total borrowing capacity of million 
the company  through the bank  also has the ability as a member of the federal reserve system  to borrow at the discount window up to of what is pledged at the federal reserve bank 
cwb qualifies for primary credit as it has been deemed to be in sound financial condition 
the rate on primary credit will be basis points less than the secondary credit rate and will generally be granted on a no questions asked basis at a rate that initially will be at basis points above the federal open market committee s fomc target federal funds rate 
as the rate is currently not attractive  it is unlikely it will be used as a regular source of funding  but is noted as available as an alternative funding source 
the company has not experienced disintermediation and does not believe this is a potentially probable occurrence 
however  in a highly competitive marketplace  cwb s core deposits excluding certificates of deposit declined by million in and the company has turned more to wholesale funding sources to help fund loan growth 
the liquidity ratio of the company was at december  compared to at december  the company s liquidity ratio fluctuates in conjunction with loan funding demands 
the liquidity ratio consists of cash and due from banks  deposits in other financial institutions  available for sale investments  federal funds sold and loans held for sale  divided by total assets 
cwbc s routine funding requirements primarily consist of certain operating expenses 
normally  cwbc obtains funding to meet its obligations from dividends collected from its subsidiary and has the capability to issue debt securities 
federal banking laws regulate the amount of dividends that may be paid by banking subsidiaries without prior approval 
interest rate risk the company is exposed to different types of interest rate risks 
these risks include lag  repricing  basis and prepayment risk 
lag risk lag risk results from the inherent timing difference between the repricing of the company s adjustable rate assets and liabilities 
for instance  certain loans tied to the prime rate index may only reprice on a quarterly basis 
however  at a community bank such as cwb  when rates are rising  funding sources tend to reprice more slowly than the loans 
therefore  for cwb  the effect of this timing difference is generally favorable during a period of rising interest rates and unfavorable during a period of declining interest rates 
this lag can produce some short term volatility  particularly in times of numerous prime rate changes 
repricing risk repricing risk is caused by the mismatch in the maturities repricing periods between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
if cwb was perfectly matched  the net interest margin would expand during rising rate periods and contract during falling rate periods 
this is so since loans tend to reprice more quickly than do funding sources 
typically  since cwb is somewhat asset sensitive  this would also tend to expand the net interest margin during times of interest rate increases 
basis risk item pricing tied to different indices may tend to react differently  however  all cwb s variable products are priced off the prime rate 
prepayment risk prepayment risk results from borrowers paying down off their loans prior to maturity 
prepayments on fixed rate products increase in falling interest rate environments and decrease in rising interest rate environments 
since a majority of cwb s loan originations are adjustable rate and set based on prime  and there is little lag time on the reset  cwb does not experience significant prepayments 
however  cwb does have more prepayment risk on its securitized and manufactured housing loans and its mortgage backed investment securities 
management of interest rate risk to mitigate the impact of changes in market interest rates on the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the amounts and maturities are actively managed 
short term  adjustable rate assets are generally retained as they have similar repricing characteristics as our funding sources 
cwb sells mortgage products and a portion of its sba loan originations 
while the company has some interest rate exposure in excess of five years  it has internal policy limits designed to minimize risk should interest rates rise 
currently  the company does not use derivative instruments to help manage risk  but will consider such instruments in the future if the perceived need should arise 
loan sales the company s ability to originate  purchase and sell loans is also significantly impacted by changes in interest rates 
increases in interest rates may also reduce the amount of loan and commitment fees received by cwb 
a significant decline in interest rates could also decrease the size of cwb s servicing portfolio and the related servicing income by increasing the level of prepayments 
deposits the following table shows the company s average deposits for each of the periods indicated below year ended december  average percent average percent average percent balance of total balance of total balance of total dollars in thousands noninterest bearing demand    interest bearing demand    savings    tcd s of  or more    other tcd s    total deposits    the maturities of time certificates of deposit tcd s were as follows december  tcd s over other tcd s over other  tcd s  tcd s in thousands less than three months     over three months through six months     over six months through twelve months     over twelve months through five years     total     the deposits of the company may fluctuate up and down with local and national economic conditions 
however  management does not believe that deposit levels are significantly influenced by seasonal factors 
the company manages its money desk and obtains brokered deposits in accordance with its liquidity and strategic planning 
such deposits increased by million during as the company s general funding needs increased due to the growth in the loan portfolio 
the company can use the money desk or obtain broker deposits when necessary in a short timeframe  however  these funds are more expensive as there is substantial competition for these deposits 
contractual obligations the company has contractual obligations that include long term debt  deposits  operating leases and purchase obligations for service providers 
the following table is summary of those obligations at december  over total year years years years in thousands fhlb borrowing     time certificates of deposits     operating lease obligations  purchase obligations for service providers  total     supervision and regulation introduction banking is a complex  highly regulated industry 
the primary goals of the regulatory scheme are to maintain a safe and sound banking system  protect depositors and the federal deposition insurance corporation s insurance fund  and facilitate the conduct of sound monetary policy 
in furtherance of these goals  congress and the states have created several largely autonomous regulatory agencies and enacted numerous laws that govern banks  bank holding companies and the financial services industry 
consequently  the growth and earnings performance of cwbc and cwb can be affected not only by management decisions and general economic conditions  but also by the requirements of applicable state and federal statues  regulations and the policies of various governmental regulatory authorities  including the board of governors of the federal reserve system  or the frb  the office of the comptroller of the currency  or the occ  and federal deposit insurance corporation  or the fdic 
the system of supervision and regulation applicable to financial services businesses governs most aspects of the business of cwbc and cwb  including i the scope of permissible business  ii investments  iii reserves that must be maintained against deposits  iv capital levels that must be maintained  v the nature and amount of collateral that may be taken to secure loans  vi the establishment of new branches  vii mergers and consolidations with other financial institutions  and viii the payment of dividends 
from time to time laws or regulations are enacted which have the effect of increasing the cost of doing business  limiting or expanding the scope of permissible activities  or changing the competitive balance between banks and other financial and non financial institutions 
proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the operations of banks and bank holding companies are frequently made in congress and by various bank and other regulatory agencies 
future changes in the laws  regulations or polices that impact cwbc and cwb cannot necessarily be predicted  but they may have a material effect on the business and earnings of cwbc and cwb 
cwbc general 
as a bank holding company  cwbc is registered under the bank holding company act of  as amended  or bhca  and is subject to regulation by the frb 
according to frb policy  cwbc is expected to act as a source of financial strength for cwb  to commit resources to support it in circumstances where cwbc might not otherwise do so 
under the bhca  cwbc is subject to periodic examination by the frb 
cwbc is also required to file periodic reports of its operations and any additional information regarding its activities and those of its subsidiaries as may be required by the frb 
cwbc is also a bank holding company within the meaning of section of the california financial code 
consequently  cwbc and cwb are subject to examination by  and may be required to file reports with  the commissioner of the california department of financial institutions dfi 
regulations have not yet been proposed or adopted or steps otherwise taken to implement the dfi s powers under this statute 
cwbc has a class of securities registered with the securities exchange commission sec under section of the securities exchange act of  as amended  act and has its common stock listed on the nasdaq national market 
consequently  cwbc is subject to supervision and regulation by the sec and compliance with nasdaq listing requirements 
bank holding company liquidity 
cwbc is a legal entity  separate and distinct from cwb 
cwbc has the ability to raise capital on its own behalf or borrow from external sources  cwbc may also obtain additional funds from dividends paid by  and fees charged for services provided to  cwb 
however  regulatory constraints on cwb may restrict or totally preclude the payment of dividends by cwb to cwbc 
transactions with affiliate 
cwbc and any subsidiaries it may purchase or organize are deemed to be affiliates of cwb within the meaning of sections a and b of the federal reserve act  and the frb s regulation w 
under sections a and b and regulation w  loans by cwb to affiliates  investments by them in affiliates stock  and taking affiliates stock as collateral for loans to any borrower is limited to of cwb s capital  in the case of any one affiliate  and is limited to of cwb s capital  in the case of all affiliates 
in addition  transactions between cwb and other affiliates must be on terms and conditions that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices  in particular  a bank and its subsidiaries generally may not purchase from an affiliate a low quality asset  as defined in the federal reserve act 
these restrictions also prevent a bank holding cwbc and its other affiliates from borrowing from a banking subsidiary of the bank holding cwbc unless the loans are secured by marketable collateral of designated amounts 
cwbc and cwb are also subject to certain restrictions with respect to engaging in the underwriting  public sale and distribution of securities 
limitations on business and investment activities 
under the bhca  a bank holding company must obtain the frb s approval before i directly or indirectly acquiring more than ownership or control of any voting shares of another bank or bank holding company  ii acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of another bank  iii or merging or consolidating with another bank holding company 
the frb may allow a bank holding company to acquire banks located in any state of the united states without regard to whether the acquisition is prohibited by the law of the state in which the target bank is located 
in approving interstate acquisitions  however  the frb must give effect to applicable state laws limiting the aggregate amount of deposits that may be held by the acquiring bank holding company and its insured depository institutions in the state in which the target bank is located  provided that those limits do not discriminate against out of state depository institutions or their holding companies  and state laws which require that the target bank have been in existence for a minimum period of time  not to exceed five years  before being acquired by an out of state bank holding company 
in addition to owning or managing banks  bank holding companies may own subsidiaries engaged in certain businesses that the frb has determined to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto 
cwbc  therefore  is permitted to engage in a variety of banking related businesses 
some of the activities that the frb has determined  pursuant to its regulation y  to be related to banking are making or acquiring loans or other extensions of credit for its own account or for the account of others servicing loans and other extensions of credit  performing functions or activities that may be performed by a trust company in the manner authorized by federal or state law under certain circumstances  leasing personal and real property or acting as agent  broker  or adviser in leasing such property in accordance with various restrictions imposed by frb regulations  acting as investment or financial advisor  providing management consulting advise under certain circumstances  providing support services  including courier services and printing and selling micr encoded items  acting as a principal  agent or broker for insurance under certain circumstances  making equity and debt investments in corporations or projects designed primarily to promote community welfare or jobs for residents  providing financial  banking or economic data processing and data transmission services  owning  controlling or operating a savings association under certain circumstances  selling money orders  travelers checks and us savings bonds  providing securities brokerage services  related securities credit activities pursuant to regulation t and other incidental activities  underwriting and dealing in obligations of the us  general obligations of states and their political subdivisions and other obligations authorized for state member banks under federal law additionally  qualifying bank holding companies making an appropriate election to the frb may engage in a full range of financial activities  including insurance  securities and merchant banking 
cwbc has not elected to qualify for these financial services 
federal law prohibits a bank holding company and any subsidiary banks from engaging in certain tie in arrangements in connection with the extension of credit 
thus  for example  cwb may not extend credit  lease or sell property  or furnish any services  or fix or vary the consideration for any of the foregoing on the condition that the customer must obtain or provide some additional credit  property or services from or to cwb other than a loan  discount  deposit or trust services the customer must obtain or provide some additional credit  property or service from or to cwbc or any subsidiaries  or the customer must not obtain some other credit  property or services from competitors  except reasonable requirements to assure soundness of credit extended capital adequacy 
bank holding companies must maintain minimum levels of capital under the frb s risk based capital adequacy guidelines 
if capital falls below minimum guideline levels  a bank holding company  among other things  may be denied approval to acquire or establish additional banks or non bank businesses 
the frb s risk based capital adequacy guidelines  discussed in more detail below in the section entitled supervision and regulaton cwb regulatory capital guidelines  assign various risk percentages to different categories of assets and capital is measured as a percentage of risk assets 
under the terms of the guidelines  bank holding companies are expected to meet capital adequacy guidelines based both on total risk assets and on total assets  without regard to risk weights 
the risk based guidelines are minimum requirements 
higher capital levels will be required if warranted by the particular circumstances or risk profiles of individual organizations 
for example  the frb s capital guidelines contemplate that additional capital may be required to take adequate account of  among other things  interest rate risk  or the risks posed by concentrations of credit  nontraditional activities or securities trading activities 
moreover  any banking organization experiencing or anticipating significant growth or expansion into new activities  particularly under the expanded powers under the gramm leach bliley act  would be expected to maintain capital ratios  including tangible capital positions  well above the minimum levels 
limitations on dividend payments 
california corporations code section allows cwbc to pay a dividend to its shareholders only to the extent that cwbc has retained earnings and  after the dividend  cwbc s assets exclusive of goodwill and other intangible assets would be times its liabilities exclusive of deferred taxes  deferred income and other deferred credits  and current assets would be at least equal to current liabilities 
additionally  the frb s policy regarding dividends provides that a bank holding cwbc should not pay cash dividends exceeding its net income or which can only be funded in ways that weaken the bank holding company s financial health  such as by borrowing 
the frb also possesses enforcement powers over bank holding companies and their non bank subsidiaries to prevent or remedy actions that represent unsafe or unsound practices or violations of applicable statutes and regulations 
the sarbanes oxley act of the sarbanes oxley act of  or the sox  became effective on july   and represents the most far reaching corporate and accounting reform legislation since the enactment of the securities act of and the exchange act of the sox is intended to provide a permanent framework that improves the quality of independent audits and accounting services  improves the quality of financial reporting  strengthens the independence of accounting firms and increases the responsibility of management for corporate disclosures and financial statements 
it is intended that by addressing these weaknesses  public companies will be able to avoid the problems encountered by several companies in the sox s provisions are significant to all companies that have a class of securities registered under section of the exchange act  or are otherwise reporting to the sec or the appropriate federal banking agency pursuant to section d of the exchange act  including cwbc collectively  public companies 
in addition to sec rulemaking to implement the sox  the nasdaq national market has adopted corporate governance rules intended to allow shareholders to more easily and effectively monitor the performance of companies and directors 
the principal provisions of the sox  many of which have been interpreted through regulations released in  provide for and include  among other things the creation of an independent accounting oversight board  auditor independence provisions that restrict non audit services that accountants may provide to their audit clients  additional corporate governance and responsibility measures  including the requirement that the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of a public company certify financial statements  the forfeiture of bonuses or other incentive based compensation and profits from the sale of an issuer s securities by directors and senior officers in the twelve month period following initial publication of any financial statements that later require restatement  an increase in the oversight of  and enhancement of certain requirements relating to  audit committees of public companies and how they interact with cwbc s independent auditors  requirements that audit committee members must be independent and are barred from accepting consulting  advisory or other compensatory fees from the issuer  requirements that companies disclose whether at least one member of the audit committee is a financial expert as such term is defined by the sec and if not discussed  why the audit committee does not have a financial expert  expanded disclosure requirements for corporate insiders  including accelerated reporting of stock transactions by insiders and a prohibition on insider trading during pension blackout periods  a prohibition on personal loans to directors and officers  except certain loans made by insured financial institutions on non preferential terms and in compliance with other bank regulatory requirements  disclosure of a code of ethics and filing a form k for a change or waiver of such code  a range of enhanced penalties for fraud and other violations  and expanded disclosure and certification relating to an issuer s disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting 
as a result of the sox  and its implementing regulations  cwbc has incurred substantial cost to interpret and ensure compliance with the law and its regulations including  without limitation  increased expenditures by cwbc in auditors fees  attorneys fees  outside advisors fees  and increased errors and omissions insurance premium costs 
effective september  the sec extended the compliance dates for non accelerated filers such as cwbc with the internal control over financial reporting requirements to july  cwbc cannot be certain of the effect  if any  of the foregoing legislation on the business of cwbc although increased costs of compliance are likely 
future changes in the laws  regulation  or policies that impact cwbc cannot necessarily be predicted and may have a material effect on the business and earnings of cwbc 
cwb general 
cwb  as a national banking association which is a member of the federal reserve system  is subject to regulation  supervision and regular examination by the occ  fdic and the frb 
cwb s deposits are insured by the fdic up to the maximum extent provided by law 
the regulations of these agencies govern most aspects of cwb s business and establish a comprehensive framework governing its operations 
regulatory capital guidelines 
the federal banking agencies have established minimum capital standards known as risk based capital guidelines 
these guidelines are intended to provide a measure of capital that reflects the degree of risk associated with a bank s operations 
the risk based capital guidelines include both a definition of capital and a framework for calculating the amount of capital that must be maintained against a bank s assets and off balance sheet items 
the amount of capital required to be maintained is based upon the credit risks associated with the various types of a bank s assets and off balance sheet items 
a bank s assets and off balance sheet items are classified under several risk categories  with each category assigned a particular risk weighting from to 
adequately well cwbc capitalized capitalized cwb consolidated greater than or equal to total risk based capital tier risk based capital ratio tier leverage capital ratio as of december   management believes that cwbc s capital levels met all minimum regulatory requirements and that cwb was considered well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action 
prompt corrective action 
the federal banking agencies possess broad powers to take prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of insured banks 
each federal banking agency has issued regulations defining five capital categories well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  and critically undercapitalized 
under the regulations  a bank shall be deemed to be well capitalized if it has a total risk based capital ratio of or more  has a tier risk based capital ratio of or more  has a leverage capital ratio of or more and is not subject to specified requirements to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure  adequately capitalized if it has a total risk based capital ratio of or more  a tier risk based capital ratio of or more and a leverage capital ratio of or more under certain circumstances and does not meet the definition of well capitalized  undercapitalized if it has a total risk based capital ratio that is less than  a tier risk based capital ratio that is less than  or a leverage capital ratio that is less than under certain circumstances significantly undercapitalized if it has a total risk based capital ratio that is less than  a tier risk based capital ratio that is less than or a leverage capital ratio that is less than  and critically undercapitalized if it has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is equal to or less than banks are prohibited from paying dividends or management fees to controlling persons or entities if  after making the payment  the bank would be undercapitalized  that is  the bank fails to meet the required minimum level for any relevant capital measure 
asset growth and branching restrictions apply to undercapitalized banks 
banks classified as undercapitalized are required to submit acceptable capital plans guaranteed by its holding company  if any 
broad regulatory authority was granted with respect to significantly undercapitalized banks  including forced mergers  growth restrictions  ordering new elections for directors  forcing divestiture by its holding company  if any  requiring management changes and prohibiting the payment of bonuses to senior management 
even more severe restrictions are applicable to critically undercapitalized banks  those with capital at or less than 
restrictions for these banks include the appointment of a receiver or conservator 
all of the federal banking agencies have promulgated substantially similar regulations to implement this system of prompt corrective action a bank  based upon its capital levels  that is classified as well capitalized  adequately capitalized or undercapitalized may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency  after notice and opportunity for a hearing  determines that an unsafe or unsound condition  or an unsafe or unsound practice  warrants such treatment 
at each successive lower capital category  an insured bank is subject to more restrictions 
the federal banking agencies  however  may not treat an institution as critically undercapitalized unless its capital ratios actually warrant such treatment 
in addition to measures taken under the prompt corrective action provisions  insured banks may be subject to potential enforcement actions by the federal banking agencies for unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their businesses or for violations of any law  rule  regulation or any condition imposed in writing by the agency or any written agreement with the agency 
enforcement actions may include the imposition of a conservator or receiver  the issuance of a cease and desist order that can be judicially enforced  the termination of insurance of deposits in the case of a depository institution  the imposition of civil money penalties  the issuance of directives to increase capital  the issuance of formal and informal agreements  the issuance of removal and prohibition orders against institution affiliated parties 
the enforcement of such actions through injunctions or restraining orders may be based upon a judicial determination that the agency would be harmed if such equitable relief was not granted 
the occ  as the primary regulator for national banks  also has a broad range of enforcement measures  from cease and desist powers and the imposition of monetary penalties to the ability to take possession of a bank  including causing its liquidation 
federal deposit insurance 
the fdic has implemented a risk based assessment system in which the deposit insurance premium relates to the probability that the deposit insurance fund will incur a loss 
under the current risk based assessment system adopted by the fdic  banks are categorized into one of three capital categories  well capitalized  adequately capitalized and undercapitalized 
assignment of a bank into a particular capital category is based on supervisory evaluations by its primary federal regulator 
cwb is currently risk rated a a  which results in cwb being categorized  group a 
because of the fdic s favorable loss experience and a healthy reserve ratio in the bank insurance fund  well capitalized and well managed banks have in recent years paid minimal premiums for fdic insurance 
the current deposit insurance system will remain in effect until the effective date of final regulations implementing the fdi reform act discussed below 
on february   president bush signed into law the federal deposit insurance reform act of the fdi reform act 
the fdi reform act represents the most significant reform in the deposit insurance system in decades 
the fdi reform act will i merge the bif and the savings association insurance fund or saif the new combined fund will be called the deposit insurance fund or dif  ii index the  insurance level to reflect inflation the first adjustment for inflation will be effective january  and thereafter adjustments will occur every years  iii increase deposit insurance coverage for retirement accounts to  which will also be subject to the every five years adjustment process  iv offer credits to banks that historically have capitalized the fdic which can be used to offset premiums otherwise due this addresses the fact that institutions that have grown rapidly have not had to pay deposit premiums  v impose a cap on the level of the deposit insurance fund and provide for dividends when the fund grows beyond a specified threshold  vi adopt the historical basis concept for distributing the aforementioned one time credit and dividends each bank s historical basis will be determined by a formula that involves looking back to the institution s assessment base in and adding premiums paid since that time and vii authorize revisions to the current risk based system for assessing premiums 
the deadline for merging the bif and the saif into the dif is july  final rules for the remaining provisions are scheduled to become effective by no later than november  while the fdi reform act assumes continuation of the fdic s current system for calculating an institution s assessment based on i the probability the institution will cause the insurance fund to incur a loss  ii the likely amount of any such loss  and iii the revenue needs of the insurance fund  the amount of future premiums and assessment rates that cwb will have pay into the dif will depend on the final regulations to be adopted by the fdic 
while management cannot make final determination of the impact of the fdi reform act until the implementing regulations are finalized  management currently believes that the implementation of the fdi reform act will not have a material effect on the business and earnings of cwbc and cwb 
money laundering and currency controls 
various federal statutory and regulatory provisions are designed to enhance record keeping and reporting of currency and foreign transactions 
pursuant to the bank secrecy act  financial institutions must report high levels of currency transactions or face the imposition of civil monetary penalties for reporting violations 
the money laundering control act imposes sanctions  including revocation of federal deposit insurance  for institutions convicted of money laundering 
the international money laundering abatement and financial anti terrorism act of imlafata  a part of the usa patriot act  authorizes the secretary of the treasury  in consultation with the heads of other government agencies  to adopt special measures applicable to banks and other financial institutions to enhance recordkeeping and reporting requirements for certain financial transactions that are of primary money laundering concern 
among its other provisions  imlafata requires each financial institution to i establish an anti money laundering program  ii establish due diligence policies  procedures and controls with respect to its private banking accounts and correspondent banking accounts involving individuals and certain foreign banks  and iii avoid establishing  maintaining  administering  or managing correspondent accounts in the untied states for  or on behalf of  a foreign bank that does not have a physical presence in any country 
in addition  imlafata contains a provision encouraging cooperation among financial institutions  regulatory authorities and law enforcement authorities with respect to individuals  entities and organizations engaged in  or reasonably suspected of engaging in  terrorist acts or money laundering activities 
the treasury department s adopted final regulations implementing imlafata mandate that federally insured banks and other financial institutions establish customer identification programs designed to verify the identity of persons opening new accounts  maintain the records used for verification  and to determine whether the person appears on any list of known or suspected terrorists or terrorist organizations 
community reinvestment act 
the cra is intended to encourage insured depository institutions  while operating safely and soundly  to help meet the credit needs of their communities 
the cra specifically directs the federal bank regulatory agencies  in examining insured depository institutions  to assess their record of helping to meet the credit needs of their entire community  including low and moderate income neighborhoods  consistent with safe and sound banking practices 
the cra further requires the agencies to take a financial institution s record of meeting its community credit needs into account when evaluating applications for  among other things  domestic branches  consummating mergers or acquisitions or holding company formations 
the federal banking agencies have adopted regulations which measure a bank s compliance with its cra obligations on a performance based evaluation system 
this system bases cra ratings on an institution s actual lending service and investment performance rather than the extent to which the institution conducts needs assessments  documents community outreach or complies with other procedural requirements 
the ratings range from outstanding to a low of substantial noncompliance 
cwb had a cra rating of satisfactory as of its most recent regulatory examination 
environmental regulation 
federal  state and local laws and regulations regarding the discharge of harmful materials into the environment may have an impact on cwb 
since cwb is not involved in any business that manufactures  uses or transports chemicals  waste  pollutants or toxins that might have a material adverse effect on the environment  cwb s primary exposure to environmental laws is through its lending activities and through properties or businesses cwb may own  lease or acquire 
based on a general survey of cwb s loan portfolio  conversations with local appraisers and the type of lending currently and historically done by cwb  management is not aware of any potential liability for hazardous waste contamination that would be reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on cwbc as of december  safeguarding of customer information and privacy 
the frb and other bank regulatory agencies have adopted guidelines for safeguarding confidential  personal customer information 
these guidelines require financial institutions to create  implement and maintain a comprehensive written information security program designed to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer information  protect against any anticipated threats or hazard to the security or integrity of such information and protect against unauthorized access to or use of such information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer 
cwb has adopted a customer information security program to comply with such requirements 
financial institutions are also required to implement policies and procedures regarding the disclosure of nonpublic personal information about consumers to non affiliated third parties 
in general  financial institutions must provide explanations to consumers on policies and procedures regarding the disclosure of such nonpublic personal information  and  except as otherwise required by law  prohibits disclosing such information except as provided in cwb s policies and procedures
