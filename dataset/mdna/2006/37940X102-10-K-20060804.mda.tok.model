asia pacific joint venture on september   we entered into an agreement to form a joint venture with the hongkong and shanghai banking corporation limited  or hsbc  to provide payment processing services to merchants in the asia pacific region 
this transaction closed on july  under the terms of the agreement  we paid hsbc million in cash to acquire a fifty six percent ownership interest in the joint venture 
we expect that this controlling interest will allow us to consolidate the results of operations of the joint venture in our consolidated statements of income 
forward looking statements in this report on form k include our expectations of the joint venture s results of operations 
data center relocation we completed the relocation of our primary data center to our atlanta headquarters by the end of the second quarter of fiscal the primary purpose of the relocation was to comply with an irs requirement regarding our facility lease with ndchealth  previously known as national data corporation  or ndc  and currently a subsidiary of per se technologies  inc ndc was our landlord and former parent company 
we believe this relocation was consistent with the expectations of the irs regarding the tax free nature of the spin off from ndchealth which occurred on january  stock split on july   our board of directors authorized a two for one stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend 
as a result of the stock split  each shareholder received one additional share of our common stock for

business description we are a leading payment processing and consumer money transfer company 
as a high volume processor of electronic transactions  we enable merchants  multinational corporations  financial institutions  consumers  government agencies and other profit and non profit business enterprises to facilitate payments to purchase goods and services or further other economic goals 
our role is to serve as an intermediary in the exchange of information and funds that must occur between parties so that a payment transaction or money transfer can be completed 
including our time as part of ndc  we have provided payment processing services since we were incorporated in georgia as global payments inc in september  and we spun off from ndc on january  we market our products and services throughout the united states  canada and europe  and we also conduct business in latin america  morocco and the philippines through our money transfer offerings 
we operate in two business segments  merchant services and money transfer  and we offer various products through these segments 
our merchant services segment targets customers in many vertical industries  including financial institutions  government  professional services  restaurants  universities  utilities  gaming  retail and health care 
our money transfer segment primarily targets immigrants in the united states and europe 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional segment information 
total revenues from our merchant services and money transfer segments  by geography and sales channel  are as follows in thousands domestic direct canada central and eastern europe domestic indirect and other merchant services domestic europe money transfer total revenue merchant services segment our offerings in the merchant services segment provide merchants  independent sales organizations  or isos  and financial institutions with credit and debit card transaction processing  as well as check related services 
we use two basic business models to market our merchant services offerings 
one model  referred to as direct merchant services  features a salaried and commissioned sales force  isos and independent sales representatives  all of whom sell our end to end services directly to merchants 
our other model  referred to as indirect merchant services  provides the same basic products and services as direct merchant services  
table of contents primarily to financial institutions and isos on an unbundled basis  that in turn resell our products and services to merchants 
we also offer sales  installation  and servicing of atm and point of sale  or pos  terminals and selected card issuing services  which are components of indirect merchant services  through global payments europe  as  formerly known as muzo  which is our subsidiary based in the czech republic 
our direct merchant services are marketed in the united states and canada and our indirect merchant services are marketed in the united states  canada and central and eastern europe 
direct merchant services revenue is generated on services primarily priced as a percentage of transaction value  whereas indirect merchant services revenue is generated on services primarily priced on a specified amount per transaction 
in both merchant services models  we also charge for other processing fees unrelated to the number of transactions or the transaction value 
direct merchant services we market our services through a variety of sales channels that includes a dedicated sales force  isos  an internal telesales group  trade associations  alliance and agent bank relationships  retail outlets and financial institutions 
in addition to receiving referrals from approximately  bank branch locations in canada  we have affiliations with hundreds of organizations  including financial institutions  alliance bank branch locations  trade associations  and value added resellers  or vars  in the united states that provide sales leads 
additionally  we market directly to customers through print advertising and direct mail efforts 
we also participate in major industry tradeshows and publicity events and actively execute various public relations campaigns 
we pursue this strategy because we believe that it utilizes one of the lowest cost delivery systems available to acquire target customers successfully 
credit and debit card transaction processing credit and debit card transaction processing includes visa  mastercard and on line and off line debit card processing 
credit and debit card processing involves a consumer or cardholder acquiring goods or services from a merchant and using a credit or debit card as the form of payment 
the term merchant generally refers to any organization that accepts credit or debit cards for the payment of goods and services  such as retail stores  including physical locations and internet sites  mail order or telephone order outlets  restaurants  universities  and government agencies 
we are the processing intermediary between the merchant and the card associations  debit networks  and financial institutions 
although card transactions may appear to be simple  a transaction requires a complex process involving various participants in a series of electronic connections 
in addition to electronic transaction payment processors such as global payments  also known as merchant acquirers  participants in this process include card issuers  cardholders  merchants  members  and card associations 
card issuers are financial institutions that issue credit and debit cards to approved applicants and are identifiable by their trade name typically imprinted on the issued cards 
an approved applicant for a credit or debit card from a card issuer is referred to as a cardholder  and may be any entity for which an issuer wishes to extend a line of credit  such as a consumer  corporation  or government agency 
the cardholder may use the card at any merchant location that meets the qualification standards of the relevant card association  such as mastercard  visa  other cards such as american express  discover  and diners club  or debit networks such as star  nyce  and pulse in the united states and interac in canada 
the card associations and debit networks consist of members  generally financial institutions  who establish uniform regulations that govern much of the industry 
during a typical card transaction  the merchant and the card issuer do not interface directly with each other  but instead rely on merchant acquirers 
a merchant acquirer can be an independent processor that acts with a member sponsor  such as global payments  or the merchant acquirer can be a bank itself 
we perform a series of services including authorization  electronic draft capture  
table of contents file transfers to facilitate the funds settlement and certain exception based  back office support services such as chargeback and retrieval resolution 
the following is a more detailed description of credit and debit card transactions a card transaction begins when a cardholder presents a card for payment at a merchant location and the merchant swipes the card s magnetic strip through a pos terminal card reader  which may be provided by global payments 
alternatively  card and transaction information may be captured and transmitted to our network through a pos device by one of a number of products that we offer directly or through a var 
for a credit card transaction  authorization services generally refer to the process in which the card issuer indicates whether a particular credit card is authentic and whether the impending transaction value will cause the cardholder to exceed defined limits 
the terminal electronically records sales draft information  such as the credit card identification number  transaction date  and dollar value of the goods or services purchased 
debit card payments differ slightly from traditional credit card transactions in that the cardholder is required to have sufficient funds available in a deposit account at the time of the transaction  or the debit card transaction will not be authorized 
pin based or on line debit transactions are sent through a debit network  while signature based  off line debit  or check card transactions are sent through card associations and require a signature at the time of purchase 
also  pin based or on line debit transactions typically deduct the purchase amount from the cardholder s deposit account within a day of the purchase  depending on the time of the purchase 
signature based  off line debit  or check card transactions typically debit the cardholder s deposit account two to three days after the purchase  although the funds are held with a memo posted to the cardholder s bank account 
a credit card posts to a cardholder s account  reducing the available credit limit in a similar manner 
after the card and transaction information is captured by the pos device  the terminal automatically either dials a pre programmed phone number or otherwise connects to our network  such as through the internet or a leased line  in order to receive authorization of the transaction 
we route the request to the applicable card association or debit network 
the card association or debit network forwards the authorization request to the card issuer  who determines a response based on the status of the cardholder s account 
the response is returned to the merchant s terminal via the same communication network 
this entire authorization and response process occurs within seconds from the time the merchant swipes the cardholder s card through the pos terminal card reader 
electronic draft capture is the process of transferring sales draft data into an electronic format so that it may be sent through networks for clearing and settlement 
the card associations use a system known as interchange  in the case of credit and off line debit cards  and financial institutions use the debit networks  in the case of on line debit cards  to transfer the information and funds between the card issuers and us to complete the link between merchants and card issuers 
in order to provide credit card transaction processing services  we must be designated as a certified processor by either mastercard or visa and as a merchant service provider by mastercard or an independent sales organization by visa 
these designations are dependent upon member clearing banks of either organization sponsoring us and our adherence to the standards of the visa and mastercard associations 
as an independent merchant acquirer  we have four primary financial institution sponsors in the united states and canada with whom we have sponsorship or depository and processing agreements 
these agreements allow us to route transactions under the member banks control and identification numbers  referred to as bin for visa and ica for mastercard or bin ica collectively  to clear credit card transactions through visa and mastercard 
the member financial institutions of visa and mastercard  some of which are our competitors  set the standards with which we must comply 
funds settlement refers to the process of transferring funds for sales and credits between cardholders and merchants 
depending on the type of transaction  either the credit card interchange system or the debit network is used to transfer the information and funds between the electronic transaction payment processor s member sponsor  or the member  and card issuer to complete the link between merchants and card issuers 
we use our network telecommunication infrastructure to deliver funding files to the member  which creates a file to fund the 
table of contents merchants over the federal reserve s automated clearing house system in the united states  or the automated clearing settlement system or the large value transfer system in canada 
in our united states portfolio and in most of our canadian portfolio  merchant funding primarily occurs after the member receives the funds from the card issuer through the card associations 
for certain of the canadian managed merchant accounts and large accounts  the member funds the merchants before the member receives the net settlement funds from the card associations  creating a net settlement asset at the member 
timing differences  interchange expenses  merchant related reserves  and exception items cause differences between the amount the member receives from the card associations and the amount funded to the merchants 
the standards of the card associations restrict us from performing funds settlement or accessing merchant settlement funds  and  instead  require that these funds be in the possession of the member until the merchant is funded 
however  in practice and in accordance with the terms of our sponsorship agreements with our members  we follow a net settlement process whereby  if the member s funding obligation to the merchant precedes the incoming amount from the card associations  the amount of that net receivable position is advanced to the member 
conversely  if the incoming amount from the card associations precedes the member s funding obligation to the merchant  we temporarily hold the surplus on behalf of the member  in a joint deposit account or in an account at the member bank 
management believes that this practice is also commonly followed by other independent processors as the members normally attempt to have a zero balance in their owned bank accounts at the end of each day 
each participant in the transaction process receives compensation for its services 
as an illustration  on a credit card transaction  the card association may fund the member after retaining a hypothetical referred to as an interchange fee or interchange expense 
the card associations have published more than different interchange expense rate arrangements 
the card issuer seeks reimbursement of from the cardholder in the cardholder s monthly credit card bill 
the member would  in turn  pay the merchant 
the net settlement after this transaction would require us to advance to the member 
after the end of the month  we would bill the merchant a percentage of the transaction  or discount  to cover the full amount of the interchange fee and our net revenue from the transaction 
if our net revenue from the merchant in the above example was basis points  we would bill the merchant at the end of the month for the transaction  reimburse ourselves for approximately in interchange fees advanced to the member and retain as our net revenue for the transaction 
our gross profit on the transaction reflects the net revenue less operating expenses  including the network and systems cost to process the transaction and commissions paid to our sales force or isos 
if it is determined that the merchant in the above transaction is to be placed on reserve or delay  then collateral is held to minimize contingent liabilities to us associated with charges properly reversed by cardholders  otherwise known as chargebacks 
this contingent liability arises from our performance guarantee to the member sponsor 
the merchant funds are held as a cash deposit to minimize this risk of loss associated with the transactions processed 
on behalf of the member  we hold all or a portion of the deposit for the convenience of the member 
in this situation  the member would net fund us  the same amount the member received from the card association 
this amount is comprised of the that would have been funded by the member to the merchant  less the same for the interchange expense 
if a transaction we had processed previously through the member is charged back by the cardholder through the card issuer  the member is notified of the shortfall in the anticipated wire 
if the amount of the chargeback is  the member would receive  net from the card association and be required to fund the merchant the same 
therefore  we effectively would be required to advance to the member 
this amount is comprised of for the chargeback  plus the same for the interchange expense 
in addition to the card processing services described above  we also process retrieval requests on behalf of merchants for issuing banks and provide chargeback resolution services  both of which relate to cardholders disputing an amount that has been charged to their credit card 
we review the dispute and handle the related exchange of information and funds between the merchant and the card issuer if a charge is to be reversed 
as a result of our financial institution sponsorship and the terms of our standard merchants agreement  our direct 
table of contents merchant services customers are liable for any charges properly reversed by the cardholder 
in the event  however  that we are not able to collect such amount from the merchants  due to merchant fraud  insolvency  bankruptcy or any other reason  we may be liable for any such reversed charges 
we utilize a number of systems and procedures to manage merchant risk 
our risk management services include credit underwriting  credit scoring  fraud control  account processing  and collections 
in addition  we may require cash deposits  guarantees  letters of credit and other types of collateral by certain merchants to minimize any such contingent liability 
notwithstanding our risk management activities  we have historically experienced losses due to merchant defaults 
check services our check products offer merchant customers risk management alternatives  in the case of our verification and recovery offerings  or risk elimination  in the case of our guarantee offerings  by leveraging our internal and external databases of checkwriters to help decide whether the merchant should accept a check as the form of payment from a particular checkwriter 
check guarantee services include comprehensive check verification and guarantee services designed for a merchant s specific needs and risk adversity 
this service offering guarantees payment of all checks that are electronically verified  primarily using pos check readers and our extensive databases  which allows merchants to expand their revenue base by applying less stringent requirements when accepting checks from consumers 
if a verified check is dishonored  our check guarantee service generally provides the merchant with reimbursement of the check s face value  and then we pursue collection of the check through our internal collection services 
while we have the right to collect the full amount of the check from the checkwriter  we have historically recovered less than of the guaranteed checks 
to protect against this risk  we use verification databases that contain information on historical delinquent check writing activity and up to date consumer bank account status 
we derive revenue for these services primarily by charging the merchant a percentage of the face value of each guaranteed check 
check verification and recovery services are similar to those provided in the check guarantee service  except that these services do not guarantee payment of the verified checks 
check verification service provides a low cost loss reduction solution for merchants wishing to measure a customer s check worthiness quickly at the point of sale without incurring the additional expense of check guarantee services 
we provide check recovery services for these customers upon their request 
we derive revenues for these services primarily from the service fees collected from delinquent check writers  fees charged to merchants based on a transaction rate per verified check  and fees charged to merchants for specialized services  such as electronic re deposits of dishonored checks 
in the specialized vertical market of gaming  our vip preferred proprietary software product provides the gaming industry with the tools necessary to establish revolving check cashing limits for the casinos customers 
vip preferred also offers an electronic check option  vip preferred e check  which eliminates the need for paper checks as part of the vip preferred suite of products 
further  our atm cash advantage product allows the casinos customers to cash a check at certain atms using a vip preferred card 
lastly  our player cash advantage product  formerly referred to as cash and win  allows the casinos customers to complete credit card cash advances at either specialized kiosks within the casinos or at the casino cages 
our gaming products allow fast access to cash with high limits so that gaming establishments can increase the flow of money to the gaming floors and reduce risk 
we derive revenue from our gaming products primarily based on a percentage of the transaction value 
indirect merchant services through our indirect merchant services business model  we market unbundled products and services primarily to financial institutions and isos that in turn resell our products and services to merchants 
the primary 
table of contents service offering in this business model is credit and debit card transaction processing 
these products and services are identical with those offered under our direct merchant services business model 
we primarily perform authorization  electronic draft capture and file transfer services for our indirect merchant services customers 
in addition  we may perform merchant accounting and other back office services 
the primary differences between indirect merchant services credit and debit card transaction processing and direct merchant services relate to funds settlement and financial institution sponsorship 
our indirect merchant services customers perform their own funds settlement and either have their own bin ica or separate financial institution sponsorship 
since we are not party to the financial institution sponsorship  we are not potentially liable for any charges properly reversed by the cardholder 
our merchant accounting services provide information primarily for our indirect merchant services customers to monitor portfolio performance  control expenses  disseminate information  and track profitability through the production and distribution of detailed statements summarizing electronic transaction payment processing activity 
our risk management services allow financial institutions to monitor credit and transaction risk  thereby enhancing the profitability of their merchant portfolios 
our risk management services include credit underwriting  credit scoring  fraud control  account processing  and collections 
in europe  we provide these indirect merchant services through our global payments europe subsidiary 
consistent with the european payments processing environment  global payments europe s offerings also include terminal management services for atm and pos terminals  as well as card issuing services 
our card issuing services in europe include card database management and card personalization 
we also provide credit scoring services to financial institutions in the czech republic and the emerging russian market 
our domestic indirect and other service offering also provides financial and operational data to financial institutions  corporations and government agencies and allows these organizations to exchange this information with financial institutions and other service providers 
we also provide edi tax filing and internet tax payment services that allow financial institutions and government agencies to offer corporate taxpayers a secure and convenient method of paying taxes electronically 
these services are primarily priced based on a rate per transaction processed 
money transfer segment our money transfer segment provides consumer to consumer money transfer services 
a majority of the revenue derived from our money transfer offering consists of our electronic money transfer services marketed under our dolex brand to the growing population of first and second generation latin americans living in the united states 
this consumer segment regularly transfers money to family and friends living in latin america 
following the europhil acquisition in december  we expanded our money transfer origination locations to europe and our settlement locations to morocco  the philippines  and new destinations in latin america 
as of may   we operated originating retail branch locations in the united states and in europe  and have settlement arrangements with more than  bank  exchange house  and retail locations worldwide 
dolex was founded in  primarily by its current management team 
the consumer to consumer money transfer service offering is primarily driven by transaction levels and unit pricing 
our business strategy is to competitively price our services  provide a timely and quality service  diversify our services through our customer loyalty program and increase our physical presence through additional originating branch locations and expansion into other settlement countries 
we believe this strategy will further expand our customer base and increase our market share 
in a typical money transfer transaction  a customer visits one of our originating branch locations and pays a fee based on the nature and amount of the transaction performed on the customer s behalf 
in addition  the customer is quoted a retail exchange rate when the money transfer transaction is requested 
the customer will receive a receipt that includes the amount the beneficiary will receive  the retail exchange rate  money transfer 
table of contents fee  settlement location and total amount that was remitted to us 
our call center provides an additional service for recipients in mexico by contacting the beneficiary to provide an identification number  the settlement location  and the transfer amount to enable the recipient to claim the transferred funds once the transaction is completed at the originating branch location 
we earn additional revenue based on the difference between the retail exchange rate that is quoted and the wholesale exchange rate when the currency is purchased  which is in much larger denominations than the individual customer s transaction 
on each business day  we determine the amount of currency needed to settle daily  bid the wholesale exchange rates based on the amount needed and purchase currency at the best available rates 
employees as of may   we had  employees 
many of our employees are highly skilled in technical areas specific to electronic transaction payment processing and money transfer 
we believe that our current and future operations depend substantially on retaining our key technical employees 
competition merchant services segment our primary competitors in the electronic transaction payment processing industry include other merchant acquirers  as well as major national and regional financial institution processors and isos  some of which are our customers 
certain of these companies are privately held  and the majority of those that are publicly held do not release the information necessary to quantify our relative competitive position precisely 
as an independent merchant acquirer  our principal affiliation with financial institutions relates to the sponsorship that enables our access to the card associations and debit networks 
we believe an independent merchant acquirer  such as global payments  will tend to be more of an advocate for the merchant customer  as there is no other relationship with a card issuing business or cardholder customer service  which is typical of a financial institution processor 
also  a financial institution processor sales channel is primarily based on customer referrals within the institution while an independent processor or iso will tend to be focused on sales from all channels  including internally generated leads 
finally  a financial institution processor may not have the same executive focus on a merchant acquiring business  as the business is generally not core to the total revenues of the financial institution 
we primarily differ from isos in that we have our own processing platform and financial institution sponsorship agreements 
based on industry publications such as the nilson report  dated april  we are a leading mid market and small market merchant acquirer in the united states 
according to that report  one of our competitors  first data corporation and its affiliates  is the largest electronic transaction payment processor in the united states 
our primary competitor in canada is moneris solutions  which we believe has a slightly larger share of the canadian merchant acquirer s market based on transactions processed 
moneris solutions is a joint venture between the royal bank of canada and the bank of montreal 
we service all industry segments and specialize in the direct merchant services  mid market and small market segments in the united states and the large and mid market segments in canada 
we define mid market as a merchant with an average of  to  in annual visa and or mastercard volume 
many of our iso relationships provide merchant referrals in the small market segment  with average annual visa and or mastercard volumes below  national accounts or large market merchants that we serve typically range between million to million in annual visa and or mastercard volume  although we serve a limited number of merchants with more than million in such volume  and a select few merchants with more than billion in such volume 
our primary strategy to distinguish ourselves from our competitors focuses on offering a variety of electronic transaction payment processing solutions to our customers 
these enhanced services involve vertical 
table of contents market functionality and sophisticated reporting features that add value to the information obtained from our electronic transaction payment processing databases 
we believe that our knowledge of these specific markets  the size and effectiveness of our dedicated sales force  affiliations with trade associations  agent banks and vars  our ability to offer specific  integrated solutions to our customers  including hardware  software  processing  and network facilities  and our flexibility in packaging these products are positive factors that enhance our competitive position 
money transfer segment our primary competitors in the money transfer business are more diversified with a broader international reach 
we believe our service offering ranks third in dollar volume transferred from the united states to latin america 
in addition  many of our competitors use agency agreements with third parties at the point of sale to collect funds and input transaction data 
we generally use a fixed cost  branch owned model at the point of sale rather than a variable cost  agent based model 
we believe this model enhances our growth strategy  as higher transaction levels may provide significant future leverage 
the most significant competitive factors relating to our consumer to consumer money transfer offering include price  reliability  customer service  functionality  the breadth and effectiveness of our distribution channel  and value added features 
these competitive factors will continue to change as new distribution channels and alternative payment solutions are developed by our competitors and us 
for instance  we believe the electronic money transfer offerings may evolve from a cash based solution to a card based solution at the origination and settlement points in the transaction process 
our ability to compete in the marketplace effectively depends on our ability to adapt to these technological and competitive advancements 
we believe our knowledge of the industry  our relative size  and our branch owned model give us an advantage over our competitors when adapting to these changes 
industry overview and target markets industry overview payment processing service providers offer high volume electronic transaction payment processing and support services directly to financial institutions  merchants  multinational corporations  government agencies  and isos 
generally  the payment processing market in the united states and canada continues to transition from traditional financial institution providers to independent merchant acquirers  such as global payments 
we believe merchants seek more efficient distribution channels  as well as increased technological capabilities required for the rapid and efficient creation  processing  handling  storage  and retrieval of information 
in europe  financial institutions remain the dominant provider of payment processing services to merchants  although the outsourcing of back end processing services to third party service providers is becoming more prevalent 
throughout all markets  processing services have become increasingly complex  requiring significant capital commitments to develop  maintain and update the systems necessary to provide these advanced services at a competitive price 
global payments also provides electronic money transfer services to consumers in the united states and europe who send money to latin america  morocco  and the philippines 
unlike our major competitors in the latin american corridor that operate an agent based network  we generally utilize a branch owned network strategy at the point of sale 
we believe that this differentiation allows us to be more flexible and competitive when setting our prices and introducing new products and services 
as a result of continued growth in our industry  several large merchant acquirers  including us  have expanded operations both domestically and internationally 
this expansion has come in the form of acquisitions and the creation of alliances and joint ventures 
we believe that the electronic payment transaction processing and money transfer industries will continue to consolidate as banks and independent processors that do not have the necessary infrastructure to participate in a highly competitive environment look to exit the business 

table of contents we believe that visa  mastercard and interac intend to migrate to cards containing chip technology in the canadian market over the coming years 
chip technology provides the ability to process payment transactions securely by protecting the cardholder information in an encrypted and confidential manner 
the chip is difficult to copy and has the additional capacity to be personalized by a card issuer  including the ability to be programmed with spending and usage limits  making it possible to authorize some transactions off line 
chip technology can also help enable a variety of additional card features including applications such as loyalty  access control  rewards  and public transit passes 
we expect that it will take multiple years for all participants to implement the computer equipment and merchant terminals necessary to accept and process the chip card compliant transactions in the canadian marketplace 
we have been working to develop a long term plan to ensure our merchants will benefit from the migration to chip technology in the canadian market 
we believe the number of electronic transactions will continue to grow in the future and that an increasing percentage of these transactions will be processed through emerging technologies 
to help our customers reduce their transaction costs and speed up the transaction approval process  we have integrated new technologies into our service offerings such as internet protocol communications and check truncation or conversion at the point of sale 
if new technologies like radio frequency identification or contactless payment cards continue to evolve and are desired by merchants and consumers  we plan to continue developing new products and services that will exploit the benefits that these new technologies can offer our customers 
we also believe that new emerging markets will continue to develop in areas that have been previously dominated by paper based transactions 
industries such as quick service restaurants  government  recurring payments  and business to business should continue to see transaction volumes migrate to more electronic based settlement solutions 
we believe that the continued development of new products and services and the emergence of new vertical markets will be a factor in the growth of our business for the foreseeable future 
target markets we believe that significant global opportunities exist for continued growth in the application of electronic transaction payment processing and money transfer services 
although the united states accounts for the largest payment processing volume in the world  global expansion by financial institutions into new geographies and the increased recognition by governments of the ability of payment cards to facilitate economic growth are rapidly transforming the electronic commerce market into a global payments opportunity 
additionally  increased migration trends led by the rapid globalization of the economy are also leading the way for increased electronic money transfer opportunities 
the growth of retail credit card transactions  as well as the rapid growth in the utilization of debit cards  directly correlates with the historic growth of our business 
according to the nilson report dated march  worldwide annual visa and mastercard purchase volume increased to over trillion in the nilson report dated february estimates that more than trillion of annual consumer spending is charged using visa and mastercard cards in the united states  a trillion  or  increase from its comparable february estimate of trillion 
based on figures reported in the nilson report dated april  we also believe that over billion us of annual canadian consumer spending uses visa  mastercard or debit as the form of payment  representing an increase of billion us  or  from the prior year estimate of billion 
in continental europe  credit card utilization remains underdeveloped relative to two of the most developed credit markets in the world  the united states and united kingdom 
after the close of the joint venture with hsbc  we will begin processing in ten countries and territories in the asia pacific region 
this new market includes almost of the world s population according to the cia world factbook 
the gross domestic product of the countries and territories in this new market as a whole grew per year on average between and according to the world bank s world development indicators database as of april this new market comprises approximately of the total asia pacific visa and mastercard purchase volume according to the nilson report dated may and of the total asia pacific population according to the cia world factbook  which leads us to believe there are significant  long term growth opportunities for payment processing in this new market 

table of contents equally as attractive has been the increase in the number of international immigrants  which the united nations population division estimates has increased from million in to million at the end of the world bank estimates that approximately billion was remitted internationally worldwide in with a significant portion of the volume originating in the united states 
in  the pew hispanic center estimated that approximately million latin american immigrants reside within the united states 
according to the inter american development bank  the expected value of electronic money transfer remittances to the latin american market in was estimated to be almost billion 
strategy in pursuing our business strategy  we seek to increase our penetration in existing markets  expand into new geographic regions  as represented by our asia pacific joint venture and the acquisition of global payments europe in the czech republic  and expand into new payment areas  as represented by our acquisitions of dolex and europhil in the electronic money transfer service industry 
we believe that this strategy provides us with the greatest opportunity to expand our existing business  leverage our existing infrastructure  and maintain a consistent base of recurring revenues  thereby maximizing shareholder equity and acquisition returns on investment 
we intend to accomplish this overall strategy as follows existing offerings in pursuing this business strategy  we intend to increase our penetration of existing markets and to further leverage our infrastructure 
our objectives to execute this strategy include the following expand our direct merchant services distribution channels  primarily our existing sales force  isos  vars  and other referral relationships  provide the best possible customer service at levels that exceed our competitors by investing in technology  training and product enhancements  grow our direct merchant services market share in the united states  canada  and asia pacific region by concentrating on the small and mid market merchant segments  grow our indirect merchant service market share in europe by concentrating on financial institutions with an existing or an emerging focus on merchant acquiring  card issuing  and credit scoring  grow our consumer to consumer money transfer customer base and market share by expanding our branch and settlement locations and offering competitive pricing  provide the latest  secure  enhanced products and services by developing value added applications  enhancing existing products  and developing new systems and services to blend technology with our customer needs  and focus on potential domestic and international acquisitions or investments and alliances with companies that have high growth and operate in profitable sectors of payments related industries through compatible products and services  and development and distribution capabilities 
international markets we intend to focus on further diversification in international markets with high payments industry growth  such as latin america  europe and the asia pacific region 
we are evaluating these markets due to the following attractive characteristics currently low but growing credit and debit card utilization  high level of immigrants who desire to send money using a non bank provider  the absence of a dominant merchant acquirer or processor  and potential to satisfy our acquisition strategy 

table of contents infrastructure our focus on the existing infrastructure will center on attracting  developing and retaining talent to execute our strategy and migrate our systems to leading edge technology 
we intend to continue systems integrations  primarily the consolidation of operating platforms 
maximize corporate returns finally  we believe we will maximize corporate returns by leveraging our core technology and operational capabilities and continue cost reduction initiatives to maximize shareholder equity and acquisition returns on investment 
currently  we have the following multi year initiatives  among others  underway that we expect will facilitate this goal developing a new technology platform that will enable us to consolidate our front end platforms in the united states and canada  migrating the asia pacific back end and front end platforms away from hsbc and onto our own platforms  continuing integration of europhil s operations into our existing dolex operations  pursuing price reductions from our vendor relationships  and streamlining of management positions and operating functions 
compliance money transfer licensing and regulations we are subject to various us federal  state and foreign laws and regulations governing money transmission and the sale of payment instruments  such as official checks and money orders 
in the united states  most states license consumer money transfer service providers and issuers of money orders such as dolex 
the applicable state statutes and regulations typically require dolex to obtain and maintain certain required licenses as a condition to performing these activities 
these statutes and regulations generally require dolex to a satisfy minimum net worth requirements  b procure and maintain a surety bond with minimum statutory levels of coverage  c demonstrate the character and fitness of the officers and directors of dolex  and d subject itself to periodic financial audits 
the consumer to consumer money transfer service offering also is subject to regulation by various agencies of the federal government that are charged with implementing and enforcing anti money laundering laws and regulations  including the bank secrecy act  as amended by the usa patriot act of  collectively referred to as the bsa 
the bsa  among other things  requires money transfer companies to develop and implement risk based anti money laundering programs  report large cash transactions and suspicious activity  and to maintain transaction records 
in addition  certain economic and trade sanctions programs that are administered by the treasury department s office of foreign assets control  or ofac  prohibit or restrict transactions to or from or dealings with specified countries  their governments  and in certain circumstances  their nationals  and with individuals and entities that are specially designated nationals of those countries  narcotics traffickers  and terrorists or terrorist organizations 
global payments european money transfer companies  created through europhil  our acquisition in december  are regulated by various governmental agencies in spain  belgium  and the united kingdom in their money transfer activities 
prior to its acquisition by global payments  europhil received approval from these governmental agencies to act as a money transfer service provider 
these governmental agencies generally require europhil to a satisfy minimum share capital requirements  b periodically submit information regarding financial results  changes in corporate documentation or ownership  insurance  and other relevant 
table of contents information  c register and maintain transaction information  d maintain adequate insurance coverage  e ensure the transparency of the conditions of the transactions to its customers  f implement safeguards and restrictions to prevent money laundering  and g subject itself to periodic audits 
in addition  the consumer to consumer money transfer service offerings are subject to regulation in the settlement countries in which dolex and europhil offer their services 
these regulations may include limitations on what types of entities may offer money transfer services  limitations on the amount of principal that can be moved into or out of a country  limitations on the number of money transfers that may be received by a customer  limitations on the exchange rates between foreign currencies  and regulations intended to help detect and prevent money laundering 
dolex and europhil have developed compliance programs to monitor regulatory requirements and developments and to implement policies and procedures to help satisfy these requirements in each origination and settlement jurisdiction 
in addition  our use of a us and european branch network for the origination of electronic money transfers  rather than an agent model typically utilized by our larger competitors  allows greater control over our regulatory compliance 
item a risk factors our revenues from the sale of services to merchants that accept visa cards and mastercard cards are dependent upon our continued visa and mastercard certification and financial institution sponsorship 
in order to provide our transaction processing services  we must be designated a certified processor by  and be a merchant service provider of  mastercard and an independent sales organization of visa 
these designations are dependent upon our being sponsored by member clearing banks of both organizations and our continuing adherence to the standards of the visa and mastercard associations 
the member financial institutions of visa and mastercard  some of which are our competitors  set the standards with which we must comply 
if we fail to comply with these standards  our designation as a certified processor  a merchant service provider or as an independent sales organization could be suspended or terminated 
the termination of any of these designations  or any changes in the visa and mastercard rules that prevent our registration or otherwise limit our ability to provide transaction processing and marketing services for the visa or mastercard organizations would likely result in the loss of merchant customers and lead to a material reduction in our revenues and earnings 
loss of key independent sales organizations could reduce our revenue growth 
our iso sales channel  which purchases and resells our end to end services to its own portfolio of merchant customers  is a strong contributor to our revenue growth 
if an iso switches to another transaction processor  we will no longer receive new merchant referrals from the iso 
in addition  we risk losing existing merchants that were originally enrolled by the iso 
consequently  if a key iso switches to another transaction processor  our revenues and earnings could be negatively affected 
we are exposed to foreign currency risks because of our significant card processing operations in canada  the czech republic  and those anticipated in the asia pacific region  as well as our significant electronic money transfer operations from the us to latin america and from spain  belgium and the united kingdom to latin america  the philippines and morocco 
we have significant operations in canada which are denominated in canadian dollars 
in addition  we have significant operations in the czech republic and spain 
we are subject to the risk that currency exchange rates between canada  the czech republic  or spain and the united states will fluctuate  potentially resulting in a loss of some of our revenue and earnings when such amounts are exchanged into us dollars 
we will have a similar risk in the asia pacific region as a result of our joint venture with hsbc 

table of contents we also have significant consumer money transfer operations which subject us to foreign currency exchange risks as our customers deposit funds in the local currencies of the originating countries where our branches are located and we typically deliver funds denominated in the home country currencies to each of our settlement locations 
some of our competitors are larger and have greater financial and operational resources than we do  which may give them an advantage in our market with respect to the pricing of our products and services offered to our customers  our ability to develop new technologies  and our ability to complete acquisitions 
we operate in the electronic payments and money transfer markets 
our primary competitors in these markets include other independent processors and electronic money transmitters  as well as certain major national and regional banks  financial institutions and independent sales organizations 
according to industry reports such as the nilson report  first data corporation and its affiliates is our largest competitor in both the electronic payments and money transfer markets 
first data and other companies who are larger than we are have greater financial and operational resources than we have 
this may allow them to offer better pricing terms to customers in these markets  which could result in a loss of our potential or current customers or could force us to lower our prices as well 
either of these actions could have a significant effect on our revenues and earnings 
in addition  our competitors may have the ability to devote more financial and operational resources than we can to the development of new technologies  including internet payment processing services that provide improved operating functionality and features to their product and service offerings 
if successful  their development efforts could render our product and services offerings less desirable to customers  again resulting in the loss of customers or a reduction in the price we could demand for our offerings 
lastly  our competitors may be willing or able to pay more than us for acquisitions  which may cause us to lose certain acquisitions that we would otherwise desire to complete 
our consumer to consumer money transfer service offerings are dependent on financial institutions to provide such offerings 
our consumer to consumer money transfer service offerings involve transferring funds internationally and are dependent upon foreign and domestic financial institutions  including our competitors  to execute funds transfers and foreign currency transactions 
changes to existing regulations of financial institution operations  such as those designed to combat terrorism or money laundering  could require us to change our operational procedures in such a way that might increase our costs of doing business or could require us to terminate certain product offerings 
in addition  as a result of existing regulations and or changes to such regulations  financial institutions could decide to cease providing the services on which we depend entirely  requiring us to terminate certain product offerings in specifically impacted markets 
in fact  several significant financial institutions have recently ceased providing such services as a result of existing regulations  which  in a particular instance  required us to rapidly switch to different financial institution providers of these services 
in the future  if we are not able to purchase these services from significant regional or national financial institutions  this would likely result in a material reduction to our consumer money transfer revenue and earnings 
we are subject to the business cycles and credit risk of our merchant customers 
a recessionary economic environment could affect our merchants through a higher rate of bankruptcy filings  resulting in lower revenues and profits for us 
our merchants are liable for any charges properly reversed by the card issuer on behalf of the cardholder 
in the event  however  that we are not able to collect such amounts from the merchants  due to merchant fraud  insolvency  bankruptcy or any other reason  we may be liable for any such charges 
any risks associated with an unexpected recessionary economy that we could not mitigate may result in lower revenues and earnings for us 
although we believe our historical loss rates are within or below industry averages  we process billions of dollars in annual visa and mastercard volume that are subject to these risks 

table of contents in order to remain competitive and to continue to increase our revenues and earnings  we must continually update our products and services  a process which could result in increased research and development costs in excess of historical levels and the loss of revenues  earnings and customers if the new products and services do not perform as intended or are not accepted in the marketplace 
the electronic payments and consumer money transfer markets in which we compete include a wide range of products and services including electronic transaction payment processing  consumer money transfer  transaction reporting and other customer support services 
these markets are characterized by technological change  new product introductions  evolving industry standards and changing customer needs 
in order to remain competitive  we are continually involved in a number of research and development projects including the development of a new front end platform for electronic payments processing 
these projects carry the risks associated with any research and development effort  including cost overruns  delays in delivery and performance problems 
in the electronic payments and consumer money transfer markets these risks are even more acute 
our markets are constantly experiencing rapid technological change 
any delay in the delivery of new products or services could render them less desirable to our customers  or possibly even obsolete 
in addition  the products and services we deliver to the electronic payments and consumer money transfer markets are designed to process very complex transactions and deliver reports and other information on those transactions  all at very high volumes and processing speeds 
any performance issue that arises with a new product or service could result in significant processing or reporting errors 
as a result of these factors  our research and development efforts could result in increased costs that could reduce our operating profit  a loss of revenue if promised new products are not timely delivered to our customers  or a loss of revenue or possible claims for damages if new products and services do not perform as anticipated 
security breaches or system failures could harm our reputation and adversely affect future profits 
we collect personal consumer data  such as names  credit and debit account numbers  checking account numbers  and payment history records 
we process that data  and deliver our products and services  by utilizing computer systems and telecommunications networks operated both by us and by third party service providers 
although plans and procedures are in place to protect this sensitive data and to prevent failure of  and to provide backup for  our systems  we cannot be certain that our measures will be successful 
a security breach or other misuse of such data  or failures of key operating systems and their back ups  could harm our reputation and deter customers from using our products and services  increase our operating expenses in order to correct the breaches or failures  expose us to unbudgeted or uninsured liability  increase our risk of regulatory scrutiny including the imposition of penalties and fines under state  federal and foreign laws  and adversely affect our continued visa and mastercard certification and financial institution sponsorship 
reduced levels of consumer spending can adversely affect our revenues and earnings 
significant portions of our revenue and earnings are derived from fees from processing consumer credit card and debit card transactions and consumer electronic money transfer transactions 
any recession or economic downturn in the us or any other country where we do business could negatively impact consumer spending and adversely affect our revenues and earnings 
changes in state  federal and foreign laws and regulations affecting the consumer electronic money transfer industry might make it more difficult for our customers to initiate money transfers  which would adversely affect our revenues and earnings 
if state  federal or foreign authorities adopt new legislation or impose new regulations that make it more difficult for our customers to initiate  or their beneficiaries to receive  electronic money transfers  then our revenues and earnings may be negatively affected 
this particular topic has been widely debated recently in the united states at both the state and federal levels  with a currently unclear outcome 
any legislation or enforcement practices that are more restrictive than historical levels that relate to latin american immigrants  including those who are not legal residents of the us  could adversely impact our consumer electronic money transfer revenue and earnings 

table of contents changes in immigration patterns can adversely affect our revenues and earnings from consumer to consumer electronic money transfers 
our consumer to consumer electronic money transfer business primarily focuses on customers who immigrate to the united states from latin american countries in order to find higher paying jobs and then send a portion of their earnings to family members in latin america 
in addition  our consumer to consumer electronic money transfer business also focuses on customers who immigrate to belgium  the united kingdom  and spain from latin american countries  morocco and the philippines 
any changes in these immigration patterns for any reason  including government policies or enforcement  may negatively affect the number of immigrants in belgium  the united kingdom  the united states  spain and any new countries in which we expand our consumer money transfer service offering in the future  which may reduce our customer base and our corresponding revenues and earnings 
in order for us to continue to grow and increase our profitability  we must continue to expand our share of the existing electronic payments and money transfer markets and also expand into new markets 
our future growth and profitability depend upon our continued expansion within the markets in which we currently operate  the further expansion of these markets  the emergence of other markets for electronic transaction payment processing  including internet payment systems  and our ability to penetrate these markets 
as part of our strategy to achieve this expansion  we are continually looking for acquisition opportunities  investments and alliance relationships with other businesses that will allow us to increase our market penetration  technological capabilities  product offerings and distribution capabilities 
we may not be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition  investment and alliance candidates in the future  and if we do  they may not provide us with the benefits we anticipated 
once completed  investments and alliances may not realize the value that we expect 
our expansion into new markets is also dependent upon our ability to apply our existing technology or to develop new applications to meet the particular service needs of each new market 
we may not have adequate financial or technological resources to develop products and distribution channels that will satisfy the demands of these new markets 
if we fail to expand into new and existing electronic payments and money transfer markets  we may not be able to continue to grow our revenues and earnings 
increases in credit card association fees may result in the loss of customers or a reduction in our profit margin 
from time to time  visa and mastercard increase the fees interchange and assessment fees that they charge processors such as us 
we could attempt to pass these increases along to our merchant customers  but this might result in the loss of those customers to our competitors who do not pass along the increases 
if competitive practices prevent our passing along such increased fees to our merchant customers in the future  we may have to absorb all or a portion of such increases thereby increasing our operating costs and reducing our profit margin 
utility and system interruptions or processing errors could adversely affect our operations 
in order to process transactions promptly  our computer equipment and network servers must be functional on a hour basis  which requires access to telecommunications facilities and the availability of electricity 
furthermore  with respect to certain processing services  we are dependent on the systems and services of third party vendors 
telecommunications services and the electricity supply are susceptible to disruption 
computer system interruptions and other processing errors  whether involving our own systems or the systems operated by our third party vendors  may result from such disruption or from human error or other unrelated causes 
any extensive or long term disruptions in our processing services could cause us to incur substantial additional expense and the loss of customers  which could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition 

table of contents the integration of the operations of the anticipated joint venture with hsbc  or other future acquisitions  if any  could result in increased operating costs if the anticipated synergies of operating both businesses as one are not achieved  a loss of strategic opportunities if management is distracted by the integration process  and a loss of customers if our service levels drop during or following the integration process 
the integration of these businesses with ours presents several challenges  including the fact that they may be based regions where we do not currently have operations 
if the integration process does not proceed smoothly  the following factors could reduce our revenues and earnings  increase our operating costs  and or result in a loss of projected synergies we could lose employees to our competitors in the region  which could significantly affect our ability to operate the business and complete the integration  if we are unable to successfully integrate the benefits plans  duties and responsibilities  and other factors of interest to the management and employees of the acquired business  we could lose customers to our competitors  which would reduce our revenues and earnings  if the the integration process causes any delays with the delivery of our services  or the quality of those services  and the acquisition and the related integration could divert the attention of our management from other strategic matters including possible acquisitions and alliances and planning for new product development or expansion into new electronic payments markets 
continued consolidation in the banking and retail industries could adversely affect our growth 
as banks continue to consolidate  our ability to offer our services through indirect channels successfully will depend in part on whether the institutions that survive are willing to outsource their credit and debit card processing to third party vendors and whether those institutions have pre existing relationships with any of our competitors 
larger banks and larger merchants with greater transaction volumes may demand lower fees which could result in lower operating margins for us 
loss of strategic industries could reduce revenues and earnings 
although our merchant acquiring portfolio is well diversified and neither one economic sector nor any customer concentration represents a significant portion of our business  a decrease in strategic industries could cause us to lose significant revenues and earnings 
unexpected and significant declines in particular industries may impact our business and result in decreases in revenues and profits 
if we lose key personnel or are unable to attract additional qualified personnel as we grow  our business could be adversely affected 
we are dependent upon the ability and experience of a number of our key personnel who have substantial experience with our operation  the rapidly changing transaction processing and money transfer industries  and the selected markets in which we offer our services 
it is possible that the loss of the services of one or a combination of our key personnel would have an adverse effect on our operations 
our success also depends on our ability to continue to attract  manage  and retain additional qualified management and technical personnel as we grow 
we cannot guarantee that we will continue to attract or retain such personnel 
we may become subject to additional us  state or foreign taxes that cannot be passed through to our merchant services or money transfer customers  in which case our profitability could be adversely affected 
payment processing companies like us may be subject to taxation by various jurisdictions on our net income or certain portions of our fees charged to customers for our services 
application of these taxes is an emerging 
table of contents issue in our industry and the taxing authorities have not yet all adopted uniform regulations on this topic 
if we are required to pay such taxes and are not able to pass the tax expense through to our merchant customers  our costs will increase  reducing our net income 
anti takeover provisions of our articles of incorporation and by laws  our rights agreement and provisions of georgia law could delay or prevent a change of control that individual shareholders favor 
provisions of our articles of incorporation and by laws  our rights agreement and provisions of applicable georgia law may discourage  delay or prevent a merger or other change of control that shareholders may consider favorable 
the provisions of our articles and by laws  among other things divide our board of directors into three classes  with members of each class to be elected in staggered three year terms  limit the right of shareholders to remove directors  regulate how shareholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at annual meetings of shareholders  and authorize our board of directors to issue preferred shares in one or more series  without shareholder approval 
we may not be able or we may decide not to pay dividends at a level anticipated by shareholders on our common stock  which could reduce shareholder returns 
the payment of dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors and will be subject to our financial results  our working capital requirements  the availability of surplus funds to pay dividends and restrictions under our credit facility 
no assurance can be given that we will be able to or will choose to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future
