item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto  included elsewhere herein 
please note that unless otherwise specifically indicated  discussion of our results relate to our continuing operations 
this discussion may contain forward looking statements that anticipate results based upon assumptions as to future events that may not prove to be accurate 
executive summary we are the second largest non hazardous solid waste management company in the united states  as measured by revenues 
we provide non hazardous solid waste collection  transfer  recycling and disposal services in states and puerto rico  geographically identified as the midwest  northeast  southeast  southwest and west regions 
our business is characterized by a relatively stable customer base 
competition is driven by local economic and demographic factors as well as fluctuations in capacity utilization  in both the collection and landfill business 
customer service satisfaction levels industry wide are very high since the collection customer has a very low tolerance for poor service 
our revenues result primarily from fees charged to customers for waste collection  transfer  recycling and disposal services 
we generally provide collection services under direct agreements with our customers or pursuant to contracts with municipalities 
commercial and municipal contract terms generally range from one to five years and commonly have renewal options 
our landfill operations include both company owned landfills and landfills that we operate on behalf of municipalities and others 
in several recent years  our operating costs  particularly fuel  repairs and maintenance  landfill operating costs and transportation  have grown more quickly than our revenues  contributing to declining operating margins 
however  this trend began to reverse and improve late in we invest a significant amount of capital to support the ongoing operations of our landfill and collection business 
landfills are highly engineered  sophisticated facilities similar to civil works 
each year we invest capital at our active landfills to ensure sufficient capacity to receive the waste volume we handle 
in addition  we have approximately  collection vehicles and over million containers to serve our collection customers 
they endure rough conditions each day and must be routinely maintained and replaced 
during the year ended december   we invested million of capital into the business see note  property and equipment  for detail by fixed asset category 
in  total capital expenditures are expected to be approximately million 
cash flows in our business are for the most part fairly predictable as a result of the nature of our customer base 
this predictability helps us to determine our ability to service debt 
knowing this  we have incurred debt to acquire the assets we own and we have paid cash to acquire existing cash flow streams 
this financial model should allow us over time to transfer the enterprise value of the company from debt holders to shareholders as we use our cash flow to repay debt 
we continue to use cash flow from operations after capital expenditures to reduce our debt balance 
we modified our operating organization at the beginning of the fourth quarter of the realignment reduced the number of operating regions to five from nine  realigned some of our districts among the regions and increased our regional functionalities through additional resource allocations 
results of operations 
net income from continuing operations for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily a result of increased revenues and reduced interest and other financing costs 
the increase also includes a million or per share income tax benefit primarily driven by the sales of certain operations and provision to return adjustments mostly related to state income taxes 

table of contents during  organic revenue growth increased  offset by an approximately decrease in recycled commodities revenue 
the organic revenue growth was driven by increases in average price per unit of approximately  including fuel recovery fees  and volume increases of approximately 
operating income for fiscal increased by million over fiscal as a result of the increase in revenues  along with reductions in selling  general and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization  that exceeded an increase in cost of operations 
most of our operating costs increased from volume increases and normal inflation 
however  we currently expect our employee benefits and fuel costs to continue to increase at a rate in excess of inflation 
beginning in and throughout  we implemented a best practices program to focus on improving sales productivity and pricing effectiveness  driver productivity through improved routing  maintenance efficiency through standardized operating practices  and reducing our procurement costs through more effective purchasing 
in addition  we are focused on improving the effectiveness of our safety and our health and welfare programs 
beginning in  we increased the level of capital expenditures to approximately million  we plan to maintain this level of capital spending for the next few years 
we expect this investment  along with improved maintenance practices  to have a favorable impact on maintenance costs 
financing activities 
we remain committed to our long term strategy of reducing our debt balance 
as this occurs  we believe the relative cost of debt and interest expense should decline 
upon achieving optimal credit ratios  we should have the opportunity to choose the best use of any excess cash flow further repay debt  pay a dividend to the extent permitted by our debt agreements  repurchase stock or reinvest in our company 
we may take advantage of opportunities that arise to accelerate the de leveraging process as long as the opportunities meet our need to maintain our competitive strength 
we continue to focus on maximizing cash flow to repay debt and to seek opportunities to create additional cash flow through reductions in interest cost 
during  we reduced our debt balance by million to billion through the refinancing plan described below 
we continue to reduce debt and improve our debt to total capitalization ratio  which decreased to at the end of from at the end of during  we completed a multifaceted refinancing refinancing aimed at enhancing liquidity  extending maturities  reducing interest costs and improving our capital structure while accelerating de leveraging 
we issued million shares of common stock for million  mandatory convertible preferred stock with a conversion premium of for million and senior notes due for million 
the proceeds from these issuances were used to retire million of the remaining senior subordinated notes due  million of the senior notes due  million of the senior notes due  million of term loans  million of the senior notes due  and the balance of the proceeds was used to pay for premiums and fees or general corporate purposes 
the refinancing decreased debt maturities for the next five years by approximately million and resulted in an annual interest savings of approximately million before tax 
in addition  we refinanced our credit facility with the credit facility  which included modifying financial covenants  increasing the size of the revolver and the institutional letter of credit facility by a combined million  and lowering the interest margin paid on the term loan by basis points and on the revolver by basis points

we generate revenues primarily from fees charged to customers for waste collection  transfer  recycling and disposal services 
we consider our core business to be our collection and disposal operations 
we also generate revenue from the sale of recycled commodities 
we record revenue as the services are provided  with revenue deferred in instances where services are billed in advance of the service being provided 
historically  we have reported certain taxes imposed on landfill and transfer volumes as a reduction of revenue because they were viewed as pass through costs generally collected from customers 
in addition  we reported a small but growing amount of administrative fees billed to customers as an offset to our administrative costs 
effective april  we began recording all taxes that create direct obligations for us as operating expenses and recording fees billed to our customers as revenue 
this presentation is in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
the impact on prior period financial statements was not material 
however  we opted to conform our prior years presentation by increasing revenue  cost of operations and selling  general and administrative expenses 
revenue  cost of operations and selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  million and million  respectively  for the year  and million  million and million  respectively  for the year these adjustments had no impact on our consolidated operating income  net income  earnings per share  cash flows  or any balance sheet caption for any previous period 
our operations are not concentrated in any one geographic region 
at december   we operated in major markets in states and puerto rico 
our regional teams focus on developing local markets in which we can operate a vertically integrated operation and maximize operating efficiency 
as a result  we may choose to not operate in a market where our business objectives cannot be met 
effective october   we modified our field organizational structure by reducing the number of our operating regions to five from nine  realigning some of our districts among the regions and increasing our regional support staff to add functional expertise and oversight in areas that are aligned with our strategic value drivers 
as a result of these actions  severance and other costs are expected to be approximately million  of which million was expensed in and the remainder is expected to be expensed in

landfill assets are amortized at a rate per ton of waste disposed 
see critical accounting judgments and estimates and note  landfill accounting for a discussion of landfill accounting 
depreciation of vehicles increases as fully depreciated trucks are replaced by new vehicles 
amortization of landfill assets increases with higher rates of inflation and decreases when an expansion is granted at a landfill site or the site experiences higher rates of compaction than those estimated 
conversely  lower than estimated compaction results in higher amortization

table of contents landfill disposal capacity and operating lives 
we had available disposal capacity of approximately billion tons as of december  we classify this total disposal capacity as either permitted having received the final permit from the governing authorities or probable expansion 
probable expansion disposal capacity has not yet received final approval from the regulatory agencies  but we have determined that certain critical criteria have been met and the successful completion of the expansion is highly probable 
see critical accounting judgments and estimates and note  landfill accounting for our requirements to classify disposal capacity as probable expansion

revenues increased over the prior year driven by increases in our collection and disposal lines of business 
the revenue increase within the collection business was driven by increases in each of the residential  commercial and roll off lines of business 
within the disposal business  landfill revenue increased while transfer revenue remained flat year over year 
recycling and other revenue decreased as commodity price declines were partially offset by increased national account related revenue and gulf coast hurricane debris clean up 
following is a summary of the change in revenues in millions reported revenues in core business organic growth increase from average base per unit price change increase from fuel recovery fees increase from net volume change net divested revenues and adjustments decrease in recycling and other reported revenues in revenue growth relating to our average price per unit on core business was million compared to million in the prior year 
our price growth of reflected the result of our continued focus on our pricing initiatives during average per unit pricing for all lines within the collection business and for the transfer and landfill businesses increased 
the improvement in price results from more central control of pricing 
the fuel recovery fees program implemented throughout generated million or of the total price growth in the current year 
these fees will increase or decrease with the price of fuel in the future 

table of contents core business volume growth for the year ended december  was  of which approximately primarily related to subcontracted revenue from national accounts and hurricane clean up work resulting from the gulf coast hurricanes 
commercial and roll off volumes increased by and  respectively 
landfill volume increased  while volume for the transfer business decreased slightly from the prior year 
the growth in our volume reflected improvement in the economy  increases in special waste jobs  more effective sales practices and the impact of hurricane debris clean up work 
cost of operations 
cost of operations increased in compared to the prior year due to increases in labor  maintenance and repairs  transportation and subcontract costs  fuel and risk management expenses 
labor costs increased as a function of inflation and higher benefits costs 
the increase in repair and maintenance expenses is attributable to additional repair costs due to fleet age 
this trend improved during the year  with repairs and maintenance actually decreasing in the fourth quarter of compared to the same period a year ago 
we expect to realize the benefits of lower total truck ownership costs in future years as a result of improvements to and standardization of our maintenance practices as well as on going capital investments to reduce the average age of our truck fleet 
transportation and subcontractor costs increased primarily as a function of volume increases from national accounts  additional subcontract costs for hurricane debris clean up work during the third and fourth quarters and increases in pass through fuel expenses 
fuel costs increased due to the impact of higher fuel prices during the year 
the increase in risk management expenses was driven primarily by million of insurance liability adjustments incurred during the current year due to adverse property and casualty experience 
also included in the other operating costs were million of asset impairment charges related to lost or damaged equipment and facilities in the areas affected by the gulf coast hurricanes in and million of loss on assets held for sale 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by million or in primarily relating to decreases in professional fees and other expenses  partially offset by increases in salaries 
the year over year decrease in professional fees of million is attributable to prior year expenses associated with the implementation of sox and the best practices program 
the decrease in other expenses primarily related to million of reversals of litigation reserves in of that amount  million pertained to a favorable court ruling involving bfi that had been pending appeal since salary expenses in included million of costs associated with an executive departure and our field organization realignment in the fourth quarter of depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization decreased in the year ended december  as compared to the same period in the decrease in amortization expenses is primarily related to lower amortization rates due to increases in landfill capacity from expansions and compaction improvement  partially offset by increased volumes 
depreciation expense related to equipment increased during  primarily due to increases in capital expenditures in the second half of and throughout interest expense and other 
interest expense and other decreased by in following are the components of interest expense and other in millions year ended december  interest expense and other interest expense  gross cash settlement on non hedge accounting interest rate swap contracts interest income interest capitalized for development projects accretion of debt and amortization of debt issuance costs non cash gain on non hedge accounting interest rate swap contracts amortization of accumulated other comprehensive loss for de designated interest rate swap contracts costs incurred to early extinguish debt interest expense allocated to discontinued operations interest expense and other from continuing operations 
table of contents the decrease in gross interest expense was attributable primarily to the repayment of debt from our continued de leveraging strategy and the refinancing of debt at lower interest rates 
in connection with the completion of the transactions included in the refinancing  we expensed million of costs to early extinguish and refinance debt during we expensed million of costs for similar activities during at december   approximately of our debt had fixed rates 
income tax expense 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was compared to for the same period in income tax expense for the year ended december  included a benefit of approximately million related to additional stock basis associated with a divestiture pending at december  that was completed in february the decrease in the effective income tax rate in was also partly due to provision to return adjustments resulting from the finalizing of income tax returns in the fourth quarter of and the increase in annual earnings before taxes in discontinued operations 
there were no divestitures during that have been presented as discontinued operations 
however  discontinued operations in included a previously deferred gain of approximately million million gain  net of tax 
this deferred gain was attributable to a divestiture that occurred in where the acquirer had the right to sell the operations back to us for a period of time a put agreement  thus constituting a form of continuing involvement on our part that precluded recognition of the gain in in the third quarter of  these operations were sold to another third party and the put agreement was cancelled 
discontinued operations in the year also included a million pre tax benefit million after tax resulting from a revision of our insurance liabilities related to divestitures previously reported as discontinued operations 
dividends on preferred stock 
dividends on preferred stock were million and million for the year ended december  and  respectively 
the increase of million for the year ended december  was a result of the dividends payable in cash for the series d mandatory convertible preferred stock series d preferred stock issued in march dividends on preferred stock also included the dividends payable in cash for the series c mandatory convertible preferred stock series c preferred stock issued in april the series c preferred stock is mandatorily convertible on april  years ended december  and revenues 
for the year ended december   revenues increased in the collection  disposal and recycled commodity lines of business as compared to the same period in the prior year 
within the collection business  residential and roll off revenues increased  while our commercial business experienced a slight decrease 
the disposal revenue increase was primarily driven by the transfer business 
additionally  price increases in our recycled commodities business also contributed to revenue growth during following is a summary of the change in revenues in millions reported revenues in core business organic growth increase from average base per unit price change increase from volume change net divested revenues and adjustments increase in commodity and other non core revenues reported revenues in excludes amounts reclassified to discontinued operations 
during  our core business organic growth of was evenly distributed between price and volume growth 
the increase in our core business average price per unit accounted for million and was driven by increases in our collection  landfill and transfer lines of business of  and  respectively 
this was a result of our continued focus to effectively manage the pricing of our new work and to replace low margin jobs with more profitable work 

table of contents the increase in our core business volume of million  or of the total organic growth  was primarily driven by volume increases of approximately and in the transfer and landfill business 
our collection business experienced a slight volume increase from prior year 
the volume growth reflected an overall improvement in the economy and more effective sales practices implemented throughout the year 
cost of operations 
cost of operations increased in compared to the prior year 
the increase for the year was primarily attributable to i inflationary increases in all costs  ii incremental increases in costs associated with increased volume such as transportation and landfill operating costs and iii increases in maintenance and repairs  landfill operating costs  fuel  and transportation and subcontractor costs in excess of inflation 
labor and related benefits  which represented over of the cost of operations  increased approximately in selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased in as compared to the increase was primarily attributable to salaries and professional fees 
included in salaries were million of costs associated with an executive departure and our field organization realignment in the fourth quarter of this amount included approximately million related to the resignation of the chairman and chief executive officer in the fourth quarter of costs associated with professional fees included approximately million for efforts to implement our best practices program across the company and an increase in professional fees for incremental costs associated with increased corporate governance regulations including implementation of sox and labor relations 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased in the year ended december  as compared to the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in landfill volume and landfill amortization rates

during and  we decreased our debt balance by million and million  respectively  and in  we refinanced approximately billion of debt with lower interest rates 
at december   approximately of our debt had fixed rates 
costs incurred to retire debt prior to maturity in included million of premiums and fees paid and million of write offs of financing costs 
these costs were associated with the repurchase of billion of our senior subordinated notes and the redemption of million of senior notes  both of which were due in costs incurred to retire debt prior to maturity in included i million for the write off of deferred financing costs and other costs 
table of contents for the refinancing of our credit facility and ii million in premiums paid and other costs for the open market repurchase of million of senior subordinated notes during the change in non cash gain on non hedge accounting interest rate swap contracts was due to changes in the market value of the underlying interest rate swap contract driven by both changes in prevailing interest rates and the remaining term of the interest rate swap contract 
the decrease in amortization of accumulated other comprehensive loss for de designated interest rate swap contracts was attributable to de designated interest rate swap contracts that matured during income tax expense 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was compared to for the same period in the increase was due in part to a decrease in annual earnings before taxes in compared with and an increase in interest provided on the tax contingency described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
minority interest 
we recognized a non recurring minority interest benefit from revised estimates used in the stipulated calculation of certain minority shareholders equity at certain consolidated subsidiaries 
discontinued operations 
certain operations that were divested during and were reflected as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements 
during  we sold operations in florida and included a net after tax loss of approximately million in discontinued operations 
also included in the results for discontinued operations for the year ended december  was a net after tax gain of million as a result of purchase price adjustments for operations sold in during  we sold discontinued operations in south carolina  georgia  colorado  new jersey  virginia and florida and included a net after tax loss of approximately million in discontinued operations

the series a senior convertible preferred stock was converted to common stock in december non cash conversion of preferred stock 
in december  the series a senior convertible preferred stock was exchanged for common stock 
in connection with the exchange  we recorded a reduction to net income available to common shareholders of million for the fair value using a common stock price on the date of conversion of of the million incremental shares of common stock issued to the holders of the preferred stock over the amount the holders would have received under the original conversion provisions 
liquidity and capital resources during  we generated operating cash flows of million  of which we reinvested million of capital into the business 
we reduced our debt balance by million to billion through equity issuances and operating cash flows 
we generally meet operational liquidity needs with operating cash flows 
our liquidity needs are primarily for working capital  capital expenditures for vehicles  containers and landfill development  capping  closure  post closure and environmental expenditures  debt service costs and scheduled debt maturities 
when we cannot meet our liquidity needs with operating cash flow  we meet those needs with borrowings under our credit facility 
we have a billion commitment until under our credit facility  which we believe is adequate to meet our liquidity needs based on current conditions 
at december   we had million of loans outstanding and million in letters of credit drawn on the revolver  leaving billion of availability for borrowings and letters of credit 
we also have letter of credit capacity of million under our institutional letter of credit facility to meet letter of credit requirements in addition to our revolver  which was fully utilized at december

in addition to funding our operational working capital needs and reducing debt  we are committed to efficiently investing in our capital asset base 
our goal is to generate returns that are above our weighted average cost of capital 
our capital expenditures are primarily for the construction and build out of our landfills  for the vehicles and containers used by our collection operations and for heavy equipment used in both our collection and landfill operations 
beginning in  we increased the level of annual capital expenditures to approximately million in order to reduce repair and maintenance costs  improve productivity and improve quality of customer service 
we expect to maintain this level of capital spending for the next few years 
we expect this investment  along with improved maintenance practices  to reduce the total cost of our truck fleet ownership 
following is a summary of capital expenditures for the years ended december  in millions  except for percentages vehicles  containers and heavy equipment landfill development other total capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions includes land and improvements  land held for permitting as landfills  buildings and improvements  and furniture and office equipment 
financing activities 
we continuously seek opportunities to increase our cash flow through improvements in operations and reduction of our interest cost 
historically  we have used bank financings and capital markets transactions to meet our refinancing and liquidity requirements 
under our credit facility  we are required to meet certain financial covenants 
our objective is to maintain sufficient surplus between the required covenant ratios and the actual ratios calculated according to the credit agreement 
we monitor the surplus carefully and will seek to take action if the surplus becomes too small 
we have not historically experienced difficulty in obtaining financing or refinancing existing debt 
we expect to continue to seek such opportunities in the future to the extent such opportunities are available to us 
see also debt covenants in contractual obligations and commitments 
significant financing events in in the first quarter of  we completed the refinancing which enhanced liquidity  extended maturities  reduced interest costs and improved our capital structure while accelerating de leveraging 

table of contents the refinancing included the issuance of million shares of common stock for million  the issuance of mandatory convertible preferred stock with a conversion premium of for million  and the issuance of senior notes due for million 
the proceeds of the issuances above were used to retire the following million of the remaining senior subordinated notes due  million of the senior notes due  million senior notes due  million of term loans  and million of the senior notes due the balance of the proceeds was used to pay for premiums and fees or general corporate purposes 
in addition  we refinanced the credit facility  which included modifying financial covenants  increasing the size of the revolver and the institutional letter of credit facility by a combined million  and lowering the interest margin paid on the term loan by basis points and on the revolver by basis points 
the refinancing decreased debt maturities for the next years by approximately million and resulted in an annual interest savings of approximately million before tax 
capital structure financing plan 
we are a highly leveraged company with billion of outstanding debt at december  the majority of our debt was incurred to acquire solid waste companies between and we incurred and assumed over billion of debt to acquire bfi in since the acquisition of bfi  we have repaid debt with cash flow from operations  asset sales and the issuances of equity 
we intend to continue to reduce our debt balance until we reach credit ratios that we believe will allow us to benefit from an investment grade like cost of capital 
we believe that as we move towards these ratios  when compared to today  we will have additional opportunities to reduce our cost of debt below our current level on a basis relative to interest rates at the time 
we expect these opportunities will increase liquidity  and provide more flexibility in deciding the most appropriate use of our cash flow 
additionally  we believe that as we reduce our financial leverage  shareholder value is created through cash flow due to reduced interest payments 
until then  we will continue to manage operating cash flows after capital expenditures to ensure repayment of our scheduled debt maturities and opportunistically reduce interest costs through refinancing transactions to the extent economically beneficial 
in both and  we completed multifaceted refinancing to reduce our overall debt  refinance our credit facility and reduce our higher cost debt 
in addition  we expect to continue to evaluate the performance of and opportunities to divest operations that do not maximize operating efficiencies or provide an adequate return on invested capital 
we may refinance or repay portions of our debt to ensure a capital structure that supports our operating plan  as well as continue to seek opportunities to extend our maturities in the future with actions that are economically beneficial 
the potential alternatives include continued application of cash flow from operations  asset sales and capital markets transactions 
capital markets transactions could include issuance of debt with longer term maturities  issuance of equity  or a combination of both 
there is no assurance that in the future we will be able to generate annual cash flows to repay debt  consummate transactions in the capital markets on commercially reasonable terms  or at all  or sell assets on terms that decrease leverage 
we have an effective shelf registration statement with the sec that allows us to issue various securities as market conditions permit 
at december   we had billion available under this shelf registration 
in october  we filed a registration statement with the sec that would increase availability under the shelf registration to billion

although we intend to renew the liquidity facility in may and do not expect to repay the amounts within the next twelve months  the loan is classified as a current liability because it has a contractual maturity of less than one year 

table of contents the following table outlines what we regard as our material  fixed  non cancelable contractual cash obligations  their payment dates and expirations 
amounts related to operating leases and purchase obligations are not recorded as a liability on our december  consolidated balance sheet and will be recorded as appropriate in future periods 
this table excludes certain obligations that we have reflected on our consolidated balance sheet  such as pension obligations  for which we do not expect to have cash funding requirements and excludes amounts related to environmental liabilities and contingencies for which the timing of payments is not determinable 
contractual obligations thereafter total recorded obligations long term debt capital lease obligations capping  closure and post closure obligations other long term liabilities unrecorded obligations operating leases purchase obligations disposal related other total cash contractual obligations amount represents scheduled principal and interest due and excludes discounts and principal due on capital leases 
scheduled interest payment obligations are calculated using stated coupons for fixed debt and interest rates effective as of december  for variable rate debt 
the current portion of other long term obligations is not reflected here  as it is included in the other accrued liabilities balance 
purchase obligations consist primarily of i disposal related agreements which include fixed or minimum royalty and host agreements and take or pay and put or pay disposal agreements and ii other obligations including a fuel contract agreement  committed capital expenditures and consulting services arrangements 
debt covenants 
our credit facility and the indentures relating to our senior subordinated notes and our senior notes contain financial covenants and restrictions on our ability to complete acquisitions  pay dividends  incur indebtedness  make investments and take certain other corporate actions 
under the credit facility  our primary financial covenants are minimum interest coverage from the quarter ending through the quarter ending ebitda interest january  december  x january  june  x july  december  x january  march  x april  june  x july  march  x april  september  x october  december  x january  june  x july  december  x january  thereafter x maximum leverage from the quarter ending through the quarter ending total debt ebitda january  december  x january  june  x july  december  x january  june  x july  december  x january  june  x july  december  x january  thereafter x 
table of contents at december   we were in compliance with all financial and other covenants under our credit facility 
we are not subject to any minimum net worth covenants 
at december   total debt ebitda ratio  as defined by the credit facility  was and our ebitda interest ratio was ebitda  which is a non gaap measure  used for covenants  is calculated in accordance with the definition in the credit facility agreement 
in this context  ebitda is used solely to provide information on the extent to which we are in compliance with debt covenants and is not comparable to ebitda used by other companies 
failure to comply with the financial and other covenants under our credit facility  as well as the occurrence of certain material adverse events  would constitute default under the credit agreement and would allow the lenders under the credit facility to accelerate the maturity of all indebtedness under the credit agreement 
this could also have an adverse impact on availability of financial assurances 
in addition  maturity acceleration on the credit facility constitutes an event of default under our other debt instruments  including our senior notes and our senior subordinated notes and  therefore  these would also be subject to acceleration of maturity 
if such acceleration of maturities of indebtedness were to occur  we would not have sufficient liquidity available to repay the indebtedness 
we would likely have to seek an amendment under the credit facility for relief from the financial covenants or repay the debt with proceeds from the issuance of new debt or equity  and or assets sales  if necessary 
we may be unable to amend the credit facility or raise sufficient capital to repay such obligations in the event the maturities are accelerated 
prepayments 
under our credit facility  if we generate cash flow in excess of specified levels  we must prepay a portion of our term loan borrowings annually prior to the stated maturity 
to make these payments  if required  we may have to use the revolver to accommodate cash timing differences 
factors primarily increasing excess cash flow  as defined in the credit agreement  could include increases in operating cash flow  lower capital expenditures and working capital requirements  net divestitures or other favorable cash generating activities 
in addition  we are required to make prepayments on the credit facility upon completion of certain transactions as defined in the credit agreement  including asset sales and issuances of debt or equity securities 
financial assurances 
we are required to provide financial assurances to governmental agencies and a variety of other entities under applicable environmental regulations relating to our landfill operations for capping  closure and post closure costs  and or related to our performance under certain collection  landfill and transfer station contracts 
we satisfy the financial assurance requirements by providing performance bonds  letters of credit  insurance policies or trust deposits 
the amount of the financial assurance requirements for capping  closure and post closure costs are determined by the applicable state environmental regulations  which vary by state 
the financial assurance requirements for capping  closure and post closure costs can either be for costs associated with a portion of the landfill or the entire landfill 
generally  states will require a third party engineering specialist to determine the estimated capping  closure and post closure costs that are used to determine the required amount of financial assurance for a landfill 
the amount of financial assurances required can  and generally will  differ from the obligation determined and recorded under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap 
the amount of the financial assurance requirements related to contract performance varies by contract 
additionally  we are required to provide financial assurance for our insurance program and collateral required for certain performance obligations 
we do not expect a material increase in financial assurances during  although the mix of financial assurance instruments may change 

table of contents at december   we had the following financial assurance instruments and collateral in place in millions landfill closure contract risk casualty collateral for post closure performance insurance obligations total insurance policies surety bonds trust deposits letters of credit total these amounts are issued under the revolver and the institutional letter of credit facility under our credit facility 
these financial instruments are issued in the normal course of business and are not debt of the company 
since we currently have no liability for these financial assurance instruments  they are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
however  we have recorded capping  closure and post closure liabilities and self insurance as the liabilities are incurred under gaap 
the underlying obligations of the financial assurance instruments would be valued and recorded in the consolidated balance sheets if it is probable that we would be unable to perform our obligations under the financial assurance contracts 
we do not expect this to occur 
off balance sheet financing we have no off balance sheet debt or similar obligations  other than financial assurance instruments discussed above and operating leases  which are not classified as debt 
we have no transactions or obligations with related parties that are not disclosed  consolidated into or reflected in our reported results of operations or financial position 
we do not guarantee any third party debt 
interest rate risk management we believe it is important to have a mix of fixed and floating rate debt to provide financing flexibility 
our policy and procedures require that no less than of our total debt is fixed  either directly or effectively through interest rate swap agreements 
at december   approximately of our debt was fixed  all directly 
from time to time  we have entered into interest rate swap agreements for the purpose of hedging variability of interest expense and interest payments on our long term variable rate bank debt and maintaining a mix of fixed and floating rate debt 
our strategy is to use interest rate swap contracts when such transactions will serve to reduce our aggregate exposure and meet the objectives of our interest rate policy 
these contracts are not entered into for trading purposes 
at december   we had no interest rate swap agreements outstanding 
contingencies securities litigation a consolidated amended class action complaint was filed against us and five of our current and former officers on march  in the us district court for the district of arizona  consolidating three lawsuits previously filed on august   august  and september  the amended complaint asserted claims against all defendants under section b of the securities exchange act of and rule b promulgated thereunder and claims against the officers under section a of the securities exchange act 
the complaint alleged that from february  to september   the defendants caused false and misleading statements to be issued in our public filings and public statements regarding our anticipated results for fiscal year the lawsuit sought an unspecified amount of damages 
we filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on may  on december   the us district court for the district of arizona granted our motion and dismissed the lawsuit with prejudice 
plaintiffs have appealed the dismissal to the th circuit court of appeals 
we do not believe the outcome of this matter will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations 

table of contents landfill permitting in september  neighboring parties and the county drainage district filed a civil lawsuit seeking to prevent bfi from obtaining a vertical elevation expansion permit at our acre landfill in donna  texas 
they claimed bfi had agreed not to expand the landfill based on a pre existing settlement agreement from an unrelated dispute years ago related to drainage discharge rights 
in  the texas commission on environmental quality tceq granted bfi an expansion permit the administrative expansion permit proceeding  and  based on this expansion permit  the landfill has an estimated remaining capacity of approximately million tons at december  nonetheless  the parties opposing the expansion continued to litigate the civil lawsuit and pursue their efforts in preventing the expansion 
in november  a judgment issued by a texas state trial court in the civil lawsuit effectively revoked the expansion permit that was granted by the tceq in  which would require us to operate the landfill according to a prior permit granted in on appeal  the texas court of appeals stayed the trial court s order  allowing us to continue to place waste in the landfill in accordance with the expansion permit granted in and has not  as yet  ruled on the need for us to post a bond to do so 
operationally  if necessary  we will attempt to obtain bonding that would allow us to continue to operate the landfill as usual during the appeals period 
in the administrative expansion proceeding on october   the texas supreme court denied review of the neighboring parties appeal of the expansion permit  thereby confirming that the tceq properly granted our expansion permit 
we are vigorously defending the civil litigation judgment in the texas court of appeals and believe that the merits of our position will prevail 
if the civil litigation appeal is not successful  the texas court of appeals has a number of possible remedies  some of which could result in the landfill becoming impaired and or requiring us to incur costs to relocate waste to another landfill 
such remedies could result in charges of up to million to our consolidated statement of operations 
it is not known when the texas court of appeals will decide the case 
tax we are subject to various federal  state and local tax rules and regulations 
although these rules are extensive and often complex  we are required to interpret and apply them to our transactions 
positions taken in tax filings are subject to challenge by taxing authorities 
accordingly  we may have exposure for additional tax liabilities if  upon audit  any positions taken are disallowed by the taxing authorities 
we are currently under examination or administrative review by various state and federal taxing authorities for certain tax years  including federal income tax audits for calendar years through a federal income tax audit for bfi s tax years ended september  through july  is complete with the exception of the matter discussed below 
prior to our acquisition of bfi on july   bfi operating companies  as part of a risk management initiative to effectively manage and reduce costs associated with certain liabilities  contributed assets and existing environmental and self insurance liabilities to six fully consolidated bfi risk management companies rmcs in exchange for stock representing a minority ownership interest in the rmcs 
subsequently  the bfi operating companies sold that stock in the rmcs to third parties at fair market value which resulted in a capital loss of approximately million for tax purposes  calculated as the excess of the tax basis of the stock over the cash proceeds received 
on january   the irs designated this type of transaction and other similar transactions as a potentially abusive tax shelter under irs regulations 
during  the irs proposed the disallowance of all of this capital loss 
the primary argument advanced by the irs for disallowing the capital loss was that the tax basis of the stock of the rmcs received by the bfi operating companies was required to be reduced by the amount of liabilities assumed by the rmcs even though such liabilities were contingent and  therefore  not liabilities recognized for tax purposes 
under the irs view  there was no capital loss on the sale of the stock since the tax basis of the stock should have approximately equaled the proceeds received 
we protested the disallowance to the appeals office of the irs in august 
table of contents in april  the appeals office of the irs upheld the disallowance of the capital loss deduction 
as a result  we paid in late april  for bfi tax years prior to the acquisition  a deficiency to the irs of million 
in july  we filed a suit for refund in the united states court of federal claims 
based on the complexity of the case  we estimate it will likely take a number of years to fully try the case and obtain a decision 
furthermore  depending on the circumstances at that time  the losing party may appeal the decision to the court of appeals for the federal circuit 
a settlement  however  could occur at any time during the litigation process 
we also received a notification from the irs assessing a penalty of million and interest of million relating to the asserted million deficiency 
in december  the irs agreed to suspend the collection of this penalty and interest until a decision is rendered on our suit for refund 
the remaining tax years affected by the capital loss issue are currently being audited or reviewed by the irs 
a decision by the united states court of federal claims on the litigation should resolve the issue in these years as well 
if we were to win the case  the initial payments would be refunded to us  subject to an appeal 
if we were to lose the case  the deficiency associated with the remaining tax years would be due  subject to an appeal 
if we were to settle the case  the settlement would likely cover all affected tax years and any resulting deficiency would become due in the ordinary course of the audits 
a deficiency payment would adversely impact our cash flow in the period the payment was made 
we continue to believe our position is well supported 
if  however  the capital loss deduction is fully disallowed  we estimate it could have a potential federal and state cash tax impact excluding penalties of up to million  of which approximately million has been paid  plus accrued interest through december  of approximately million million net of tax benefit 
any payments would be made from cash flow generated by operations or from borrowings  including borrowings under our credit facility or accessing the public debt markets 
also  if the capital loss deduction is disallowed  the irs could propose a penalty of up to of the additional income tax due including the million already assessed 
because of several meritorious defenses  we believe the successful assertion of penalties is remote 
the potential tax and interest but not penalties impact of a full disallowance has been fully reserved on our consolidated balance sheet 
with regard to tax and accrued interest through december   a disallowance would not materially adversely affect our consolidated results of operations 
the periodic accrual of additional interest charged through the time at which this matter is resolved will continue to affect our consolidated results of operations 
in addition  the successful assertion by the irs of penalties could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated liquidity  financial position and results of operations 
indemnification we enter into contracts in the normal course of business that include indemnification clauses 
indemnifications relating to known liabilities are recorded in the consolidated financial statements based on our best estimate of required future payments 
certain of these indemnifications relate to contingent events or occurrences  such as the imposition of additional taxes due to a change in the tax law or adverse interpretation of the tax law  and indemnifications made in divestiture agreements where we indemnify the buyer for liabilities that may become known in the future but that relate to our activities prior to the divestiture 
as of december   we estimate the contingent obligations associated with these indemnifications to be insignificant 
landfill costs subtitle d under rcra and other regulations that apply to the non hazardous solid waste disposal industry have required us  as well as others in the industry  to alter operations and to modify or replace pre subtitle d landfills 
such expenditures have been and will continue to be substantial 
further regulatory changes could accelerate expenditures for closure and post closure monitoring and obligate us to spend sums in addition to those presently reserved for such purposes 
these factors  together with the other factors discussed above  could substantially increase our operating costs and our ability to invest in our facilities

sfas r and the related fsps are effective for us beginning january  upon adoption  we plan to transition to sfas r using the modified prospective application  whereby compensation expense is only recognized in the consolidated statements of operations beginning with the period of adoption and thereafter  with prior periods still presented on a pro forma basis 
as a result of sfas r  we currently expect that income from continuing operations will decrease by approximately million  or approximately

in addition  on january   allied granted its chief executive officer options to acquire  shares of our stock see note  commitments and contingencies

table of contents critical accounting judgments and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and necessarily include certain estimates and judgments made by management 
the following is a list of accounting policies that we believe are the most critical in understanding our company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows  and that may require management to make subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
no one geographic operating segment has a more significant concentration of the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below 
we have noted examples of the residual accounting and business risks inherent in these accounting policies 
residual accounting and business risk is defined as the inherent risk that allied faces after the application of our policies and processes and is generally outside of our control 
accounting policy and process residual accounting and use of estimates business risk landfill accounting landfill operations are treated as a period expense and are not discussed further herein 
our landfill assets fall into two categories  each of which require accounting judgments and estimates 
landfill development costs that are capitalized as an asset as incurred 
landfill retirement obligation that results in an asset when we record our capping  closure and post closure liabilities 
we use the life cycle accounting method for landfills and the related capping  closure and post closure liabilities 
in life cycle accounting  all capitalizable costs to acquire  develop and retire a site are recorded to amortization expense based upon the consumption of disposal capacity 
estimates of future landfill disposal capacity are updated periodically at least annually based on third party surveys 
landfill development site permit and technical design in order to develop  construct and operate a landfill  we are required to obtain permits from various regulatory agencies at the local  state and federal level 
the permitting process requires an initial siting study to determine whether the location is feasible for landfill operations 
the studies are typically prepared by third party consultants and reviewed by our environmental management group 
the initial studies are submitted to the regulatory agencies for approval 
changes in legislative or regulatory requirements may cause changes in the landfill site permitting process 
these changes could make it more difficult or costly to obtain a landfill permit 
studies performed by third parties could be inaccurate which could result in the revocation of a permit and changes to accounting assumptions 
conditions could exist that were not identified in the study  which make the location not feasible for a landfill and could result in the revocation of a permit 
revocation of a permit could materially impair the recorded value of the landfill asset 

table of contents accounting policy and process residual accounting and use of estimates business risk actions by neighboring parties  private citizen groups or others to oppose our efforts to obtain permits could result in revocation or suspension of a permit  which could adversely impact the economic viability of the landfill and could materially impair the recorded value of the landfill 
technical landfill design upon receipt of initial regulatory approval  technical landfill designs are prepared 
these designs are compiled by third party consultants and reviewed by our environmental management group 
the technical designs include the detailed specifications to develop and construct all components of the landfill including the types and quantities of materials that will be required 
the technical designs are submitted to the regulatory agencies for approval 
upon approval of the technical design  the regulatory agencies issue permits to develop and operate the landfill 
changes in legislative or regulatory requirements may require changes in the landfill technical design 
these changes could make it more difficult or costly to meet new design standards 
technical design requirements  as approved  may need modifications at some future point in time 
third party designs could be inaccurate and could result in increased construction costs or difficulty in obtaining a permit 
landfill disposal capacity included in the technical designs are factors that determine the ultimate disposal capacity of the landfill 
these factors include the area over which the landfill will be developed  the depth of excavation  the height of the landfill elevation and the angle of the side slope construction 
the disposal capacity of the landfill is calculated in cubic yards 
this measurement of volume is then converted to a disposal capacity expressed in tons based on a site specific expected density to be achieved over the remaining operating life of the landfill 
estimates of future disposal capacity may change as a result of changes in legislative or regulatory design requirements 
the density of waste may vary due to variations in operating conditions  including waste compaction practices  site design  climate and the nature of the waste 
capacity is defined in cubic yards but waste received is measured in tons 
the number of tons cubic yard varies by type of waste 
development costs the types of costs that are detailed in the technical design specifications generally include excavation  natural and synthetic liners  leachate collection system construction  installation of methane gas collection systems and monitoring probes  installation of groundwater monitoring wells  construction of leachate management facilities and other costs associated with the development of the site 
we review the adequacy of our cost estimates used in the annual update of development costs by comparing estimated costs with third party bids or contractual arrangements  review changes in year over year cost estimates for reasonableness and compare our resulting development cost per acre with prior periods 
these development costs  together with any actual future costs of construction materials and third party labor could differ from the costs we have estimated because of the impact from general economic conditions on the availability of the required materials and labor 
technical designs could be altered due to unexpected operating conditions  regulatory changes or legislative changes 

table of contents accounting policy and process residual accounting and use of estimates business risk costs incurred to acquire  design and permit the landfill  including capitalized interest  are recorded to the landfill asset on the balance sheet as incurred 
landfill development asset amortization in order to match the amortization of the landfill asset with the revenue generated by the landfill operations  we amortize the landfill development asset over its operating life on a per ton basis as waste is accepted at the landfill 
at the end of a landfill s operating life  the landfill asset is fully amortized 
the per ton rate is calculated by dividing the sum of the landfill net book value and estimated future development costs as described above of the landfill by the estimated remaining disposal capacity 
the costs are not inflated and discounted  but rather expressed in nominal dollars 
this rate is applied to each ton accepted at the landfill and recorded as a charge to amortization expense 
amortization rates are influenced by the original cost basis for the landfill  including acquisition costs  which in turn is determined by geographic location and market values 
we have secured significant landfill assets through business acquisitions in recent years and valued them at the time of acquisition based upon market value 
also  per ton rates are influenced by site specific engineering and cost factors 
estimate updates on at least an annual basis  we update the estimates of future development costs and remaining disposal capacity for each landfill 
these costs and disposal capacity estimates are reviewed and approved by senior operations management annually 
changes in the cost estimates are reflected prospectively in the landfill amortization rates that are updated annually 
increases and decreases in our cost estimates and changes in disposal capacity will normally result in a change in our amortization rates on a prospective basis 
an unexpected significant increase in estimated costs or reduction in disposal capacity could affect the ongoing economic viability of the landfill and result in an asset impairment 
landfill retirement obligation we have two types of retirement obligations related to landfills capping and closure and post closure monitoring 
landfill capping as individual areas within each landfill reach capacity  we are required to cap and close the areas in accordance with the landfill site permit 
these requirements are detailed in the technical design of the landfill siting process described above 
changes in legislative or regulatory requirements including changes in capping  closure activities or post closure monitoring activities  types and quantities of materials used  or term of post closure care could cause changes in our cost estimates 

table of contents accounting policy and process residual accounting and use of estimates business risk closure and post closure monitoring closure costs are those costs after a landfill site stops receiving waste  but prior to being certified as closed 
after the entire landfill site has reached capacity and is closed  we are required to maintain and monitor the site for a post closure period  which generally extends for a period of years 
post closure requirements generally include maintenance of the site and monitoring the methane gas collection systems and groundwater systems  and other activities that occur after the site has ceased accepting waste 
costs associated with post closure monitoring generally include groundwater sampling  analysis and statistical reports  third party labor associated with gas systems operations and maintenance  transportation and disposal of leachate and erosion control costs related to the final cap 
landfill retirement obligation liability asset estimates of the total future costs required to cap  close and monitor the landfill as specified by each landfill permit are developed annually 
the estimates include the specific timing of the estimated future cash outflows  considering the anticipated waste flow into the capping events  the landfill and inflation 
our cost estimates are inflated to the period of performance using an estimate of inflation  which is updated annually in both and 
the present value of the remaining capping costs for a specific capping event and the remaining closure and post closure costs for the landfill are accrued as incurred on a per ton basis 
these liabilities are incurred as disposal capacity is consumed at the landfill 
capping  closure and post closure liabilities are recorded in layers and discounted using our credit adjusted risk free rate in effect at the time the obligation is incurred 
a corresponding retirement obligation asset is recorded for the same value as the additions to the capping  closure and post closure liabilities 
the retirement obligation asset is amortized to expense on a per ton basis as disposal capacity is consumed 
the per ton rate is calculated by dividing the sum of the recorded retirement obligation asset net book value and expected future additions to the retirement actual timing of disposal capacity utilization could differ from projected timing  causing differences in timing of when amortization and accretion expense is recognized for capping  closure and post closure liabilities 
changes in future inflation rate projections could impact our actual future costs and our total liability 
changes in our capital structure could result in changes to the credit adjusted risk free rate used to discount the liabilities  which could cause changes in future recorded liabilities and expense 
changes in the landfill retirement obligation due to changes in the anticipated waste flow  cost estimates or the timing of expenditures for closed landfills and fully incurred but unpaid capping events are recorded in results of operations as new information becomes available 
this could result in unanticipated increases or decreases in expense 
rates could change in the future based on the evaluation of new facts and circumstances relating to landfill capping design  post closure monitoring requirements  or the inflation or discount rate 

table of contents accounting policy and process residual accounting and use of estimates business risk obligation asset by the remaining disposal capacity 
a per ton rate is determined for each separate capping event based on the disposal capacity relating to that event 
closure and post closure per ton rates are based on the total disposal capacity of the landfill 
the recorded retirement obligation is increased each year to reflect the passage of time by accreting the balance at the same credit adjusted risk free rate that was used to calculate each layer of the recorded liability 
this accretion expense is charged to cost of operations 
actual cash expenditures reduce the asset retirement obligation liability as they are incurred 
estimate updates on an annual basis  we update the estimate of future capping  closure and post closure costs and estimates of future disposal capacity for each landfill 
revisions in estimates of our costs or timing of expenditures are recognized immediately as increases or decreases to the capping  closure and post closure liabilities and corresponding retirement obligation asset 
changes in the asset resulting in changes to the amortization rates are applied prospectively  except for fully incurred capping events and closed landfills  where the changes are recorded immediately in results of operations since the associated disposal capacity has already been consumed 
disposal capacity as described previously  disposal capacity is determined by the specifications detailed in the landfill permit obtained 
we classify this disposal capacity as permitted 
we also include probable expansion disposal capacity in our remaining disposal capacity estimates  which relate to additional disposal capacity being sought through means of a permit expansion 
probable expansion disposal capacity has not yet received final approval from the regulatory agencies  but we have determined that certain critical criteria have been met and the successful completion of the expansion is highly probable 
our internal criteria to classify disposal capacity as probable expansion are as follows we may be unsuccessful in obtaining permits for probable expansion disposal capacity because of the failure to obtain the final local  state or federal permit or due to other unknown reasons 
if we are unsuccessful in obtaining permits for probable expansion disposal capacity  or the disposal capacity for which we obtain approvals is less than what was estimated  both costs and disposal capacity will change  which will generally increase the rates we charge for landfill amortization and capping  closure and post closure accruals 
an unexpected decrease in disposal capacity could cause an asset impairment 

table of contents accounting policy and process residual accounting and use of estimates business risk we have control of and access to the land where the expansion permit is being sought 
all geologic and other technical siting criteria for a landfill have been met or a variance from such requirements has been received or can reasonably be expected to be achieved 
the political process has been assessed and there are no identified impediments that cannot be resolved 
we are actively pursuing the expansion permit and have an expectation that the final local  state and federal permits will be received within the next five years 
senior operations management approval has been obtained 
after successfully meeting these criteria  the disposal capacity that will result from the planned expansion is included in our remaining disposal capacity estimates 
additionally  for purposes of calculating the landfill amortization and capping  closure and post closure rates  we include the incremental costs to develop  construct  close and monitor the related probable expansion disposal capacity 
environmental liabilities liabilities arise from contamination existing at our landfills or at third party landfills that we or a predecessor company have delivered or transported waste to and are based on our estimates of future costs that we will incur for incremental remediation activities and the related litigation costs 
to determine our ultimate liability at these sites  we have used third party environmental engineers and attorneys to assist in the evaluation of several factors  including the extent of contamination at each identified site and the most appropriate remedy 
we accrue for costs associated with environmental remediation obligations when such costs are probable and reasonably estimable 
the majority of our environmental liabilities are obligations that we assumed in connection with an acquisition 
any increases in the assumed accruals for environmental liabilities from the amounts recorded by the predecessor are charged to operating expense 
if the liabilities arise through the normal course of business  the accruals are also charged to operating expense 
actual settlement of these liabilities could differ from our estimates due to a number of uncertainties  such as the extent of contamination at a particular site  the final remedy  the financial viability of other potentially responsible parties and the final apportionment of responsibility among the potentially responsible parties 
actual amounts could differ from the estimated liability as a result of changes in estimated future litigation costs to pursue the matter to ultimate resolution including both legal and remedial costs 
an unanticipated environmental liability that arises could result in a material charge to operating expense 

table of contents accounting policy and process residual accounting and use of estimates business risk estimate updates we periodically consult with outside legal counsel and environmental engineers to review the status of all environmental matters and to assist our environmental and legal management in updating our estimates of the likelihood and amounts of remediation 
as the timing of cash payments for these liabilities is uncertain  the accrued costs are not discounted 
any changes in the liabilities resulting from these reviews are recorded to operating income in the period in which the change in estimate is made 
summary we have determined that the recorded liability for environmental matters as of december  and of approximately million and million  respectively  represents the most probable outcome of these contingent matters 
cash paid for environmental matters during and was million and million  respectively 
we do not expect that adjustments to estimates  which are reasonably possible in the near term and that may result in changes to recorded amounts  will have a material effect on our consolidated liquidity  financial position or results of operations 
however  we believe that it is reasonably possible that the ultimate outcome of environmental matters  excluding capping  closure and post closure costs could result in approximately million of additional liability 
due to the nature of these matters  the cash flow impact would not be immediate and would most likely be over a period greater than five years 
non recurring acquisition accruals at the time of an acquisition accounted for under the purchase method of accounting  we evaluate and record liabilities of the acquired company to represent our estimate of fair value 
assumed liabilities as well as liabilities resulting directly from the completion of the acquisition are considered in the net assets acquired and resulting purchase price allocation 
there could be changes in circumstances or estimates that cause the actual settlement of these liabilities to be higher or lower than our original estimates 
additional liabilities may exist that are related to the acquired operations but that have not been identified 
liabilities related to restructuring and abandonment activities are generally accrued through a charge to expense 
additionally  transition costs that are not accruable at the time of acquisition  including transitional personnel costs  route restructurings and costs associated with the consolidation of 
table of contents accounting policy and process residual accounting and use of estimates business risk operations  are expensed in the period in which the costs are incurred 
estimate updates we evaluate the adequacy of the non recurring acquisition accruals at least annually by obtaining third party actuarial valuations of assumed self insurance obligations  third party legal counsel updates for assumed litigation and field and corporate management reviews of all acquisition related commitments 
any changes in the liabilities resulting from these reviews are recorded in the period in which the change in estimate is made 
the adjustment is charged to either an expense or goodwill consistent with how the original liability was established and the period of time that has elapsed since the date of the acquisition 
generally  we do not record adjustments to goodwill after one year from the date of the acquisition 
summary at december  and  we had approximately million and million  respectively  of non recurring acquisition accruals remaining on our balance sheet  consisting primarily of loss contracts  litigation and compliance  and risk management and insurance liabilities associated with the acquisition of bfi 
cash paid against non recurring acquisition accruals  including severance  in was million and million in self insurance liabilities and related costs we maintain high deductibles for commercial general liability  automobile liability and workers compensation insurance and are fully self insured for employee group health claims 
deductible levels are between million and million 
the retained or non insured portion of the liability for unpaid claims and associated expenses  including incurred but not reported losses  is reflected in our balance sheet as an accrued liability 
the liability for unpaid claims and associated expenses for commercial general liability  automobile liability and workers compensation is actuarially determined by a third party actuary 
we use a third party administrator to track and evaluate actual claims experience for consistency with the data used in the annual actuarial valuation 
the expense is charged to operating costs 
the actuarially determined liability is calculated for the most part by our past claims experience factor  which considers both the incident rates  including frequency and severity  could increase or decrease during a year causing our current and future actuarially determined obligations to increase or decrease 
the costs to discharge our obligations  including legal costs and health care costs  could increase or decrease causing current and or prior estimates of our self insurance liability to change 

table of contents accounting policy and process residual accounting and use of estimates business risk frequency and settlement amount of claims 
as of december  and  we had approximately million and million of self insurance liabilities on our balance sheet 
our recorded liabilities are not discounted 
cash paid for self insurance claims during and was million and million  respectively 
loss contingencies we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims  the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty 
we determine whether to disclose and accrue for loss contingencies based on an assessment of whether the risk of loss is remote  reasonably possible or probable and whether it can be reasonably estimated 
we analyze our litigation and regulatory matters based on available information to assess potential liability 
management s assessment is developed in consultation with our outside counsel and other advisors and is based on an analysis of possible outcomes under various strategies 
generally  we record losses related to contingencies in cost of operations or selling  general and administrative expenses  depending on the nature of the underlying transaction leading to the loss contingency 
actual costs can vary from estimates for a variety of reasons 
for example  the costs from settlement of claims and litigation can vary from estimates based on differing interpretations of laws  opinions on culpability and assessments on the amount of damages 
loss contingency assumptions involve judgments that are inherently subjective and generally involve business matters that are by nature unpredictable 
if a loss contingency results in an adverse judgment or is settled for significant amounts  it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  cash flows and financial position in the period or periods in which such judgment or settlement occurs 
asset impairment valuation methodology we evaluate our long lived assets for impairment based on projected cash flows anticipated to be generated from the ongoing operation of those assets 
evaluation criteria if we have changes in events or circumstances  including reductions in anticipated cash flows generated by our operations or determinations to divest of certain assets  certain assets could be impaired which would result in a non cash charge to earnings 
we test long lived assets for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset s carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
examples of such events could include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which we use a long lived asset  a change in its physical condition  or new circumstances that would cause an expectation that it is more likely than not that we would sell or otherwise dispose of a long lived asset significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
our most significant asset impairment exposure  other than goodwill see discussion below is our investment in landfills 
a reduction in our estimated disposal capacity as a result of unanticipated events could trigger an impairment charge 

table of contents accounting policy and process residual accounting and use of estimates business risk recognition criteria if such circumstances arise  we recognize an impairment for the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset  if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
we use the present value of the expected cash flows from that asset to determine fair value 
goodwill impairment valuation methodology we evaluate goodwill for impairment based on the fair value of each reporting unit 
we define reporting units as our five geographic operating segments 
we estimate fair value based on projected net cash flows discounted using a weighted average cost of capital  which was approximately in in addition  consideration is also given to an earnings multiple approach as an indicator of the reasonableness of our discounted cash flow 
evaluation criteria the estimated fair value could change as there are future changes in our capital structure  cost of debt  interest rates  actual capital expenditure levels  ability to perform at levels that were forecasted  or the market capitalization of the company 
for example  a reduction in long term growth assumptions could reduce the estimated fair value to below carrying value  which would trigger an impairment charge 
similarly  an increase in our weighted average cost of capital could trigger an impairment charge 
annually  we test realizability of goodwill  as described above 
in addition  we test goodwill for recoverability between annual evaluations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
examples of such events could include a significant adverse change in legal factors  liquidity or in the business climate  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  unanticipated competition  loss of key personnel  or new circumstances that would cause an expectation that it is more likely than not that we would sell or otherwise dispose of a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit 
recognition criteria we recognize an impairment if the net book value exceeds the fair value on a reporting unit basis 
at the time of a divestiture of an individual business unit within a reporting unit  goodwill is allocated to that business unit based on the relative fair value of the unit being disposed to the total reporting unit and a gain or loss on disposal is derived 
subsequently  the remaining goodwill in the reporting unit from which the assets were divested is re evaluated for impairment  which could also result in an additional loss 
in the past  we have incurred non cash losses on sales of assets driven primarily by the goodwill allocated to the assets divested 
if similar divestiture decisions are made in the future  we could incur additional non cash losses on asset sales 
a divestiture of any individual asset below the reporting unit level could result in a loss 

table of contents accounting policy and process residual accounting and use of estimates business risk summary at december  and  we had recorded goodwill of billion 
at december  and  there was no impairment of goodwill upon completion of our annual evaluation of goodwill recoverability 
tax accruals we account for income taxes using a balance sheet approach whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences in financial reporting and income tax basis of assets  other than non deductible goodwill  and liabilities 
the differences are measured using the income tax rate in effect during the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we utilize outside experts and legal counsel to assist in the development or review of significant tax positions used in establishing our liability 
we provide a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets including net operating loss  capital loss and minimum tax credit carryforwards when it is more likely than not that we will not be able to realize the future deduction giving rise to the deferred tax asset 
we record liabilities for probable tax adjustments proposed or expected by tax authorities at the federal and state level 
the acquisition of bfi in  which was accounted for as a business purchase combination  resulted in approximately billion of goodwill  billion of which amortization is non deductible for tax purposes 
at december   approximately billion of non deductible goodwill remains on our balance sheet 
income tax expense is recorded on an interim basis based the balance sheet classification and amount of the tax accounts established relating to acquisitions are based on certain assumptions that could possibly change based on the ultimate outcome of certain tax matters 
as these tax accounts were established in purchase accounting  any future changes relating to these amounts will result in balance sheet reclassifications  which may include an adjustment to goodwill 
changes in estimated realizability of deferred tax assets could result in adjustments to income tax expense 
we are currently under examination or administrative review by various state and federal taxing authorities for certain tax years 
the internal revenue code irc and income tax regulations are a complex set of rules that we are required to interpret and apply to our transactions 
positions taken in tax years under examination are subject to challenge 
accordingly  we may have exposure for additional tax liabilities arising from these audits if any positions taken are disallowed by the taxing authorities 
see note of our consolidated financial statements included herein 
actual income tax rates can vary from period to period as a result of differences between estimated and actual earnings  non deductible items and tax credit utilization 
an increase or decrease in the tax rate could have a material impact on our results of operations 
on the expected annual effective tax rate and discrete period items 
the annual effective tax rate is determined using estimated full year earnings  non deductible items and tax credits that are anticipated to be utilized 
summary as of december   we have federal and state net operating loss and minimum tax credit carryforwards with an after tax benefit totaling million most of which will expire if not used 
valuation allowances have been established for the possibility that 
table of contents accounting policy and process residual accounting and use of estimates business risk certain of the state carryforwards may not be used 
defined benefit pension plans recognition criteria our defined benefit retirement plan was assumed in connection with the acquisition of bfi 
the benefits of approximately of the current plan participants were frozen upon acquisition 
the benefit obligation and associated income or expense is actuarially determined by an independent third party based on actuarial assumptions we believe are reasonable 
we use a third party to administer the plan and maintain certain data that is provided to the actuary 
the plan assets are managed by a third party that is not affiliated with our actuary 
we recognize in our financial statements an accrued liability or a prepaid pension expense  for the difference between the cost to satisfy our pension obligation and the investment income earned or contributions to the plan 
pension income or expense is recorded to selling  general and administrative expense 
our funding policy is to make annual contributions to the pension plan as determined to be required by the plan s actuary and to meet the minimum requirements of the employee retirement income security act erisa and the irc 
no contributions were required during the last three years 
no contributions are anticipated for the plan s policy is to invest the plan s assets as determined by our benefits committee 
at december   of the total plan assets of million  approximately was invested in fixed income bond funds and approximately in equity funds 
changes in our investment mix and performance of the equity and bond markets and of fund managers could impact the amount of pension income or expense recorded  the funded status of the plan and the need for future cash contributions 
at december   our defined benefit retirement plan was under funded by million 
assumptions the assumptions used in the actuarially determined funded status are as follows weighted average assumptions as of our measurement date  september discount rate expected return on plan average rate of compensation increase 
table of contents accounting policy and process residual accounting and use of estimates business risk our discount rate is based on a model which matches the timing and amount of our expected pension plan cash outflows to maturities of high quality bonds as priced on our measurement date 
where that timing is beyond a currently published high quality bond rate  the model uses an expected yield curve to determine an appropriate current discount rate 
our discount rate is sensitive to changes in market based interest rates 
a decrease in the discount rate will increase the funding liability 
the expected return on our plan assets represents a long term view of returns based on our current asset mix 
in developing our expected rate of return assumption  we evaluated an analysis of long term expected and historical actual returns on the plan assets from our investment managers  which gave consideration to our asset mix and anticipated length of obligation of our plan 
if actual return on plan assets varies from the expected returns  the fair value of the plan assets will differ from our projections 
the average rate of compensation increase applies only to the portion of the plan that is not frozen 
less than of the plan participants continue to earn benefits 
this rate reflects our expectations of average pay increases over the period benefits are earned 
we annually review our actual asset allocation  discount rate  expected rate of return and other actuarial assumptions and adjust them as deemed necessary 
changes in our key assumptions could cause changes in our assets  liabilities and income or expense recorded 
for example  a decrease in the discount rate would result in a greater benefits obligation in future periods 
a lower expected return on assets would also increase the amount of pension expense recorded

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
we are subject to interest rate risk on our variable rate long term debt 
from time to time  to reduce the risk from interest rate fluctuations  we have entered into hedging transactions that have been authorized pursuant to our policies and procedures 
we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any leveraged derivatives 
we currently have no outstanding interest rate swap arrangements at december  increases or decreases in short term market rates did not materially impact cash flow in at december   with of our debt fixed  we have billion of floating rate debt 
if interest rates increased by basis points  annualized interest expense and cash payments for interest would increase by approximately million million after tax 
this analysis does not reflect the effect that interest rates would have on other items  such as new borrowings nor the favorable impact declining rates would have on interest expense and cash payments for interest 
see notes and to our consolidated financial statements in this form k for additional information regarding how we manage interest rate risk 
fuel prices 
fuel costs represent a significant operating expense 
as such  from time to time we mitigate this impact with fixed price purchase contracts 
a significant portion of these contracts expired in the first quarter of however  there are contracts remaining for million gallons per month at per gallon expiring march  and million gallons per month at per gallon expiring february  the prices are before applicable tax and delivery charges 
together these contracts cover slightly less than one third of our monthly fuel consumption 
if diesel prices approximate the annual average  we estimate increased fuel expense of slightly over million per month upon the expiration of both contracts 
when economically practical  we may enter into new or renewed contracts  or engage in other strategies to mitigate our fuel market risk 
as a result of rising fuel costs  where appropriate  we have implemented fuel recovery fees that vary with the cost of fuel 
at our current consumption levels and with our current fixed price purchase contracts  a one cent change in the price of diesel fuel would affect annual net income by approximately million  before offsetting the effect of any fuel recovery fee 
accordingly  a substantial rise or drop in fuel costs could result in a material impact to our costs of operations 
commodities prices 
we market recycled products such as cardboard and newspaper from our material recycling facilities 
as a result  changes in the market prices of these items will impact our results of operations 
revenues from sales of recycled cardboard and newspaper in were approximately million
