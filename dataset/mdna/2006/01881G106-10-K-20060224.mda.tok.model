item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations holding holding s principal source of income and cash flow is attributable to its investment in alliancebernstein 
the holding financial statements and notes and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with those of alliancebernstein 
results of operations years ended december  change in thousands alliancebernstein net income weighted average equity ownership interest equity in earnings of alliancebernstein net income of holding diluted net income per unit distribution per unit equity in earnings of alliancebernstein  net income and diluted net income per unit significantly decreased in and increased in as a result of alliancebernstein s million in charges taken during the second half of  of which i million was paid to the restitution fund  ii million was used to settle a private civil mutual fund litigation unrelated to any regulatory agreements  and iii million was reserved for estimated expenses related to our market timing settlements with the sec and the nyag and our market timing related liabilities market timing charges 
capital resources and liquidity years ended december  change in millions  except per unit amounts partners capital  as of december distributions received proceeds from exercise of options distributions paid available cash flow the significant factors affecting the change in partners capital year to year are net income and proceeds from the exercise of options for holding units  both increasing partners capital  and cash distributions paid to unitholders  decreasing partners capital 
see statements of changes in partners capital and comprehensive income in item for further details 
holding is required to distribute all of its available cash flow  as defined in the holding partnership agreement  to its unitholders 
available cash flow in was significantly higher than in and due to the market timing charges 
the third quarter distribution was declared prior to the recording of these charges 
over the next two quarters  distributions were reduced  reflecting these charges and  commencing in second quarter  quarterly distributions returned to traditional levels in relation to cash flow 
alliancebernstein paid million during related to market timing related matters and has cumulatively paid million 
including million in charges taken in prior periods  alliancebernstein has reserves of approximately million available for market timing related liabilities in future periods 
we cannot determine at this time the eventual outcome  timing  or impact of market timing related matters 
accordingly  it is possible that additional charges in the future may be required  the amount  timing  and impact of which we are unable to estimate at this time 
cash and cash equivalents were  as of december  and zero as of december   and cash inflows from alliancebernstein distributions received were offset by cash distributions paid to unitholders  income taxes paid  and the movement in other working capital items 
management believes that the cash flow from its investment in alliancebernstein will provide holding with the resources to meet its financial obligations 
commitments and contingencies see note of the holding financial statements contained in item alliancebernstein executive overview we provide diversified investment management services to institutional clients  high net worth clients and retail investors 
as of december   we had client assets under management of approximately billion  an increase of over december   invested in growth and value equities  blended equities  fixed income  balanced  and index structured services 
our strategy is to continue to expand and leverage our extensive  global research capabilities to provide both innovative and time tested wealth management solutions to help our clients achieve investment success and peace of mind 
through sanford c 
bernstein co  llc and sanford c 
bernstein limited each a wholly owned subsidiary  we provide in depth research  portfolio strategy and trade execution services to institutional clients 
importantly  we are striving to ensure that our firm s culture is one in which client interests are always placed first and the highest ethical standards are maintained 
our revenues are primarily earned for managing the investment assets of our clients 
these revenues vary with the total value of our assets under management  which increase or decrease depending upon capital market appreciation or depreciation  investment returns achieved for clients  and asset inflows or outflows from new and existing clients 
both our fourth quarter and full year financial results exceeded our expectations 
our fourth quarter reflected strong investment performance  strong net asset inflows  and improved financial results 
overall  our relative investment returns were competitive 
in growth equities  we outperformed benchmarks in many of our key services  including large cap growth  us growth and mid cap growth services 
while growth equities outperformed value equities for a third consecutive quarter  value equities still posted good returns  especially over the longer term 
our style blend equity services performed well  especially in global style blend which had excellent one year performance results 
with this solid performance  we believe we are positioned well to gather additional assets as the shift toward growth style investing continues 
additionally  exhibited strong organic growth among all client groups 
for the year  we brought in over billion in gross asset flows and billion in net asset flows before dispositions and market appreciation  both firm records 
value equity fundings led the way with nearly billion and billion in gross and net inflows  respectively 
institutional investment services aum accounted for of our overall aum 
for the year  we had record inflows of billion  owing mainly to the strength in our global and international services 
institutional flows continued to be well diversified geographically and among investment services 
looking ahead  we expect to continue to focus on building our global institutional investment platforms in the asia pacific region  and expanding our presence in continental europe 
retail services ending aum was up for the year  excluding the effect of the dispositions of cash management services and indian mutual funds assets of nearly billion 
non us retail inflows continued at a healthy pace  while  in the us  our separately managed account business strengthened 
however  we continued to experience net us fund outflows  although at a declining rate 
we are confident that retail services have begun to stabilize 
our new asset allocation services  such as our target date retirement funds  are geared toward investors long term interests and have been gaining visibility 
these services present us with an opportunity to capture assets in the increasingly important retirement arena 
looking ahead  we will continue to rebuild and enhance our presence in japan and to upgrade and enlarge our us and us sales forces 
our private client services comprised nearly billion in aum  a increase during net inflows totaled almost billion during  but leveled off somewhat during the fourth quarter owing to seasonal factors 
throughout we continued to invest in our private client business opening up new offices and adding staff 
we increased the number of financial advisors during to  an increase of from at the end of in  we plan to open our first non us private client services office in london  and to build a deeper presence in the us by increasing the number of financial advisors by to by the end of institutional research services recorded million in revenues for the year  an increase of over within the us  higher revenues resulted from higher market share and transaction volume  offset partially by lower revenue yields from a shift to program trading and continued industry wide brokerage commission pricing declines 
our market share gains are the result of the consistent high quality of our research 
in london  we achieved revenue growth in the broadening of our trading platforms in the us and the expansion of our research  trading  and sales capabilities in europe have proven to be successful 
on that note  we were again highly ranked in a recent institutional investor survey of best us independent research firms 
as we look to  we plan to launch asian distribution of our us and european research and launch a new electronic trading offering in london 
recent declines in commission rates charged by broker dealers are likely to continue and may accelerate 
increasing use of electronic trading networks which permit investors to execute securities transactions at a fraction of typical full service broker dealer charges and pressure exerted by funds and institutional investors are likely to result in continuing  perhaps significant  declines in commission rates  which would  in turn  reduce the revenues generated by institutional research services 
looking ahead  the most significant initiative that benefits all of our clients is our continued investment in research  a core competency of our firm 
we have a broad foundation in fundamental and quantitative research 
our fundamental research includes comprehensive industry and company coverage from growth  value and fixed income perspectives 
more recent activity in this area includes our new research office in shanghai  china  as well as our early stage growth and strategic change units focusing on advancing technologies 
our current focus in quantitative research is based on three areas finding and exploiting pricing anomalies in the capital markets  solving complex investment planning problems  and utilizing portfolio construction tools to optimize global portfolios 
we intend to develop additional research initiatives in the foreseeable future 
assets under management starting in we revised the way we classified our assets under management to better align publicly reported assets under management with our internal reporting  and for consistency our assets under management as of december  and previous years have been reclassified by investment service and distribution channel  including the fixed income components of balanced accounts previously reported in equity 
as a result  as of december   approximately billion in assets under management were reclassified from equity billion from growth equity and billion from value equity to fixed income 
in addition  certain fixed income assets managed for insurance company clients previously reported at cost are now being reported at market value  resulting in approximate increases in fixed income assets under management of between billion and billion at each reporting date 
this change did not impact reported revenues  nor will it impact future revenues 
assets under management by distribution channel were as follows as of december  change in billions institutional investment retail private client total assets under management by investment service were as follows as of december  change in billions growth equity us global international value equity us global international fixed income us global international index structured us global international total us global international total changes in assets under management during were as follows in billions distribution channel investment service institutional investment retail private client total growth equity value equity fixed income index structured total balance as of january  long term flows sales new accounts redemptions terminations cash flow unreinvested dividends net long term inflows outflows dispositions transfers market appreciation net change balance as of december  changes in assets under management during were as follows in billions distribution channel investment service institutional investment retail private client total growth equity value equity fixed income index structured total balance as of january  long term flows sales new accounts redemptions terminations cash flow unreinvested dividends net long term inflows outflows net cash management redemptions market appreciation net change balance as of december  average assets under management by distribution channel and investment service were as follows years ended december  change in billions distribution channel institutional investment retail private client total years ended december  change in billions investment service growth equity value equity fixed income index structured total consolidated results of operations years ended december  change in millions revenues expenses income before income taxes income taxes net income diluted net income per unit distributions per unit pre tax margin income before income taxes as a percentage of total revenues 
in  net income increased million  or  to million  and net income per unit increased  or  to 
the increase was due primarily to higher investment advisory and services fees  gains recognized on the dispositions of our cash management services  indian mutual funds and south african joint venture interest  lower promotion and servicing expenses  and lower general and administrative expenses  partially offset by higher employee compensation and benefits and lower distribution revenues 
in  net income increased million to million and net income per unit increased to 
the increases were due principally to the million in charges taken during the second half of  of which i million was paid to the restitution fund  ii million was used to settle a private civil mutual fund litigation unrelated to any regulatory agreements  and iii million was reserved for estimated expenses related to our market timing settlements with the sec and the nyag and our market timing related liabilities market timing charges 
higher net income was also due to an increase in investment advisory and services fees and institutional research services revenues  partially offset by higher employee compensation and general and administrative expenses 
revenues the following table summarizes the components of total revenues years ended december  change in millions investment advisory and services fees distribution revenues institutional research services shareholder servicing fees other revenues  net total investment advisory and services fees the following table summarizes the components of investment advisory and services fees years ended december  change in millions institutional investment base fees transaction charges performance fees retail base fees transaction charges n m performance fees n m private client base fees transaction charges performance fees total base fees transaction charges performance fees investment advisory and services fees  the largest component of our revenues  include base fees  which are generally calculated as a percentage of the value of assets under management often times referred to as basis points and vary with the type of investment strategy and discipline  the size of account  and the total amount of assets we manage for a particular client 
accordingly  fee income generally increases or decreases as average assets under management increase or decrease and is therefore affected by market appreciation or depreciation  the addition of new client accounts or client contributions of additional assets to existing accounts  withdrawals of assets from and termination of client accounts  purchases and redemptions of mutual fund shares  and shifts of assets between accounts or products with different fee structures 
our base fees increased million  or  in  primarily due to higher average assets under management in institutional investments and private client  partially offset by the disposition of our cash management services in the retail distribution channel 
our base fees increased million  or  in  primarily due to a increase in average assets under management resulting from market appreciation and net asset inflows  partially offset by retail mutual fund fee reductions described below 
investment advisory and services fees include brokerage transaction charges earned by scb llc for certain private client and institutional investment client transactions 
these transaction charges aggregated million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
the decrease in resulted from a number of factors  including a management initiative implemented during the first half of which changed the structure of investment advisory and services fees charged to private clients for our services 
the restructuring eliminated transaction charges for most private clients while raising base fees 
this restructuring increases the transparency and predictability of asset management costs for our private clients 
the elimination of these transaction charges was not a result of alliancebernstein s agreement with the nyag or any other regulator 
separately  beginning january   we intend to report all revenues earned by scb from brokerage transactions executed for clients of alliancebernstein as institutional research services revenues 
certain investment advisory contracts provide for a performance based fee  in addition to or in lieu of a base fee 
this fee is calculated as either a percentage of absolute investment results or a percentage of investment results in excess of a stated benchmark over a specified period of time 
performance based fees are recorded as revenue at the end of the measurement period and will be higher in favorable markets and lower in unfavorable markets  which may increase the volatility of our revenues and earnings 
performance based fees aggregated million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
the increase in reflects strong investment performance in hedge funds  equity value and style blend investment services 
the increase in was attributable to higher global equity and fixed income fees from strong investment performance 
institutional investment advisory and services fees increased for as a result of an increase in average assets under management  and higher performance based fees of million  partly offset by lower transaction charges of million due to lower transaction volume and the increased use of electronic trading systems 
these fees increased for  primarily as a result of an increase in average assets under management offset by a decrease in brokerage transaction charges of million due primarily to lower transaction volume and a decline in performance based fees of million 
retail investment advisory and services fees decreased for  primarily as a result of a decrease in average assets under management  reflecting the disposition of assets related to our cash management services during the second quarter of these fees decreased for  primarily as a result of million in revenue reductions from company sponsored us long term open end retail mutual funds in connection with the settlement of market timing related matters discussed in item  partly offset by a increase in average assets under management 
private client investment advisory and services fees increased for  primarily as a result of increased billable assets under management  partly offset by decreases in brokerage transaction charges of million due primarily to the implementation of a new pricing structure which eliminated transaction charges for most private clients  partly offset by an increase in asset based fees 
these fees increased for  primarily as a result of billable assets under management  an increase in performance based fees of million and an increase in brokerage transaction charges of million due to higher transaction volume 
distribution revenues alliancebernstein investments acts as distributor of our retail products and receives distribution services fees from certain of those funds as partial reimbursement of the distribution expenses it incurs 
distribution revenues decreased in  principally due to the sale of our cash management services during the second quarter of distribution revenues increased in  principally due to higher average mutual fund assets under management 
institutional research services institutional research services revenue consists principally of brokerage transaction charges received for providing in depth research and other services to institutional investors 
revenues from institutional research services increased for due to higher market share  higher average daily volumes in both the us and us stock markets and pricing increases in the uk  partly offset by pricing declines in the uk revenues from institutional research services increased for  due to higher market share of nyse volume and higher revenues from growth in european operations  partly offset by lower domestic pricing 
shareholder servicing fees investor services and acmgis provide transfer agency services for our mutual funds 
shareholder servicing fees decreased  primarily as a result of the reduction in the number of shareholder accounts and fee reductions 
shareholder servicing fees decreased in the decreases were due to outsourcing certain services and fewer shareholder accounts serviced 
the number of shareholder accounts serviced declined to approximately million as of december   from approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively  primarily due to the disposition of our cash management services and net redemptions of long term us mutual funds 
other revenues  net these revenues consist of investment income and net interest income earned on securities loaned to and borrowed from brokers and dealers  and fees earned for administration and recordkeeping services provided to our mutual funds and the general accounts of axa and its subsidiaries 
in addition  these revenues include mark to market gains or losses on investments related to deferred compensation plan obligations 
we purchase shares of alliancebernstein mutual funds to hedge our deferred compensation plan obligations 
we classify these investments as trading investments  and as such  recognize unrealized mark to market gains or losses in each reporting period 
the cost of our obligations  adjusted for mark to market gains and losses  is amortized over the vesting period  which is generally four years 
other revenues increased million  or  in  reflecting the net gain on the disposition of our cash management services  including contingent earn out payments  totaling million  the net gain on the disposition of our indian mutual funds of million  and the net gain on the disposition of our south african joint venture interest of million 
another contributing factor was a million increase in brokerage interest and dividends and interest on our deferred compensation investments 
other revenues increased in  principally as a result of interest income and net investment gains recorded in connection with the consolidation of a joint venture and its funds under management due to the application of fin r  as discussed in note of alliancebernstein s consolidated financial statements in item expenses the following table summarizes the components of expenses years ended december  change in millions employee compensation and benefits promotion and servicing general and administrative interest amortization of intangible assets charge for mutual fund matters and legal proceedings n m total employee compensation and benefits we had  full time employees as of december  compared to  in and  in employee compensation and benefits  which represented approximately of total expenses in  include base compensation  commissions  fringe benefits  cash and deferred incentive compensation based generally on profitability  and other employment costs 
in  base compensation  fringe benefits and other employment costs increased million  or  primarily as a result of annual merit increases and additional headcount 
incentive compensation increased million  or  primarily due to higher short term incentive compensation reflecting higher earnings and higher deferred compensation amortization due to vesting of prior year awards 
commission expense increased million  or  reflecting higher revenues or sales across all channels 
in  base compensation  fringe benefits and other compensation increased million  or  primarily due to merit increases  a mix shift to more highly compensated employees and higher recruitment costs 
incentive compensation increased million  or  as a result of higher short term incentive compensation expense from higher earnings and higher amortization of deferred compensation expense  due to vesting of prior year awards 
commission expense increased million  or  primarily due to higher revenues in institutional investment  private client  and institutional research services 
promotion and servicing promotion and servicing expenses  which represented approximately of total expenses in  include distribution plan payments to financial intermediaries for distribution of company sponsored mutual funds and cash management services products and amortization of deferred sales commissions paid to financial intermediaries for the sale of back end load shares

see item for further discussion of deferred sales commissions and the disposition of our cash management services 
also included in this expense category are costs related to travel and entertainment  advertising  promotional materials  and investment meetings and seminars for financial intermediaries that distribute our mutual fund products 
promotion and servicing expenses decreased in and in the decrease in was primarily due to an million decrease in distribution plan payments  largely reflecting the disposition of our cash management services during the second quarter of  and a million decrease in amortization of deferred sales commissions as a result of lower sales of back end load shares 
the decrease in reflects a million decrease in amortization of deferred sales commissions  resulting from lower b share mutual fund sales  partially offset by an million increase in travel and entertainment and printing costs 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses  which represented approximately of total expenses in  are costs related to operations  including technology  professional fees  occupancy  communications and similar expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  in and increased million  or  in  significant changes include years ended december  in millions loss on disposals of fixed assets occupancy costs minority interests from consolidation of a vie fin r sarbanes oxley compliance data processing costs write downs of capitalized software charge for directed brokerage investigations impairment of exchange memberships legal costs  net of insurance recoveries other the majority of the decreases in reflect the impact of specific charges that were recorded in but not in addition  legal costs were lower in as a result of insurance recoveries 
in  increased occupancy costs relate to higher rent for new office space and accelerated rent for vacated facilities 
loss on disposals of fixed assets includes the write off of obsolete software and leasehold improvements at vacated facilities 
the minority interests from consolidation of a variable interest entity vie required by fin r reflects nine months of minority interest since adoption of the new accounting pronouncement 
the vie was sold effective december   accordingly  the impact was reversed in taxes on income alliancebernstein  a private limited partnership  is not subject to federal or state corporate income taxes 
however  we are subject to the new york city unincorporated business tax 
our domestic corporate subsidiaries are subject to federal  state and local income taxes  and are generally included in the filing of a consolidated federal income tax return  separate state and local income tax returns are filed 
foreign corporate subsidiaries are generally subject to taxes in the foreign jurisdictions where they are located 
the increase in is primarily due to a higher proportion of pre tax earnings of foreign subsidiaries that resulted in a higher effective tax rate 
the increase in was also primarily due to higher pre tax earnings of our foreign subsidiaries 
the lower effective tax rate in  compared to  though  was the result of the non deductibility in of approximately million in expenses related to the market timing charges 
capital resources and liquidity the following table identifies selected items relating to capital resources and liquidity change in millions  except per unit amounts as of december partners capital cash and cash equivalents for the years ended december cash flow from operations additional investments by holding from proceeds from exercise of compensatory options capital expenditures purchases of holding units distributions paid available cash flow distributions per alliancebernstein unit the significant factors affecting the change in partners capital year to year are net income and additional investments by holding from proceeds from the exercise of options to acquire holding units  both increasing partners capital  and cash distributions paid to unitholders  decreasing partners capital 
alliancebernstein is required to distribute all of its available cash flow  as defined in the alliancebernstein partnership agreement  to its unitholders and the general partner 
available cash flow in was significantly higher than in and due to the market timing charges 
the third quarter distribution was declared prior to recording these charges 
over the next two quarters  distributions were reduced  reflecting these charges 
commencing in second quarter  quarterly distributions returned to traditional levels in relation to cash flow 
in  cash and cash equivalents decreased million and increased million and million in and  respectively 
cash inflows are primarily provided from operations and from the proceeds from the exercise of options for holding units 
significant cash outflows are cash distributions paid to its unitholders and the general partner  purchases of holding units to fund deferred compensation plans and capital expenditures 
on january  and january   we deposited an additional million and million  respectively  in united states treasury bills in a special reserve account pursuant to rule c requirements 
contingent deferred sales charge our mutual fund distribution system the system includes a multi class share structure that permits our open end mutual funds to offer investors various options for the purchase of mutual fund shares  including both front end load shares and back end load shares 
for open end us fund front end load shares  alliancebernstein investments pays sales commissions to financial intermediaries distributing the funds from the front end sales charge it receives from investors at the time of sale 
for back end load shares  alliancebernstein investments pays sales commissions to the financial intermediaries at the time of sale and also receives higher ongoing distribution services fees from the mutual funds 
in addition  investors who redeem before the expiration of the minimum holding period which ranges from one year to four years pay a contingent deferred sales charge cdsc to alliancebernstein investments 
we expect to recover deferred sales commissions over periods not exceeding five and one half years 
payments of sales commissions made to financial intermediaries in connection with the sale of back end load shares under the system  net of cdsc received of million  million  and million  respectively  totaled approximately million  million  and million during   and  respectively 
debt and credit facilities total available credit  debt outstanding  and weighted average interest rates as of december  and were as follows december  credit available debt outstanding interest rate credit available debt outstanding interest rate in millions senior notes commercial paper revolving credit facility extendible commercial notes other n a n a total in august  we issued million of notes senior notes pursuant to a shelf registration statement under which we may issue up to million in senior debt securities 
the senior notes mature in august and are redeemable at any time 
the proceeds from the senior notes were used to reduce commercial paper and credit facility borrowings and for other general partnership purposes 
we intend to use cash flow from operations to retire the senior notes at maturity 
in september  we entered into an million five year revolving credit facility with a group of commercial banks and other lenders 
of the million total  million is intended to provide back up liquidity for our million commercial paper program  with the balance available for general purposes 
under this revolving credit facility  the interest rate  at our option  is a floating rate generally based upon a defined prime rate  a rate related to the london interbank offered rate libor or the federal funds rate 
the revolving credit facility contains covenants which  among other things  require us to meet certain financial ratios 
we were in compliance with the covenants as of december  on february   we replaced the existing arrangement with a new million five year revolving credit facility with substantially the same terms 
as of december   we maintained a million extendible commercial notes ecn program as a supplement to our million commercial paper program 
ecns are short term uncommitted debt instruments that do not require back up liquidity support 
our substantial equity base and access to public and private debt  at competitive terms  should provide adequate liquidity for our general business needs 
management believes that cash flow from operations and the issuance of debt and alliancebernstein units or holding units will provide us with the resources to meet our financial obligations 
off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations we have no off balance sheet arrangements other than the guarantees and contractual obligations that are discussed below 
guarantees in february  alliancebernstein signed a million agreement with a commercial bank  under which we guaranteed certain obligations in the ordinary course of business of scbl 
in the event scbl is unable to meet its obligations in full when due  alliancebernstein will pay the obligations within three days of being notified of scbl s failure to pay 
this agreement is continuous and remains in effect until payment in full of any such obligation has been made by scbl 
during  we were not required to perform under the agreement and as of december  had no liability outstanding in connection with the agreement 
aggregate contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in millions debt operating leases  net of sublease commitments accrued compensation and benefits minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries total accrued compensation and benefits amounts above exclude liabilities due within one year and accrued pension expense 
any amounts reflected on the consolidated balance sheet as payables to broker dealers  brokerage clients  and our mutual funds and accounts payable and accrued expenses are excluded from the table above 
certain of our deferred compensation plans provide for election by participants to have their deferred compensation awards invested notionally in holding units and in company sponsored mutual funds 
since january   we made purchases of mutual funds totaling million to fund our future obligations resulting from participant elections with respect to awards 
during the fourth quarter of  we purchased holding units with an aggregate value of approximately million 
as of december   these holding units were held in a deferred compensation trust to fund our future obligations to participants who elected to notionally invest a portion of their awards in holding units 
we expect to make contributions to our qualified profit sharing plan of approximately million in each of the next four years 
we currently expect to contribute an estimated million to our qualified  noncontributory  defined benefit plan during dispositions see note of alliancebernstein s consolidated financial statements in item for a discussion of dispositions 
contingencies see note of alliancebernstein s consolidated financial statements in item for a discussion of our mutual fund distribution system and related deferred sales commission asset  certain legal proceedings to which we are a party  and mutual fund investigations 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
management believes that the critical accounting policies and estimates discussed below involve significant management judgment due to the sensitivity of the methods and assumptions used 
deferred sales commission asset management tests the deferred sales commission asset for impairment quarterly  or monthly when events or changes in circumstances occur that could significantly increase the risk of impairment of the asset 
significant assumptions utilized to estimate the company s future average assets under management and undiscounted future cash flows from back end load shares include expected future market levels and redemption rates 
market assumptions are selected using a long term view of expected average market returns based on historical returns of broad market indices 
as of december   management used average market return assumptions of for fixed income and for equity to estimate annual market returns 
higher actual average market returns would increase undiscounted future cash flows  while lower actual average market returns would decrease undiscounted future cash flows 
future redemption rate assumptions of   and were determined by reference to actual redemption experience over the five year  three year  and one year periods ended december   respectively  calculated as a percentage of the company s average assets under management of back end load shares 
an increase in the actual rate of redemptions would decrease undiscounted future cash flows  while a decrease in the actual rate of redemptions would increase undiscounted future cash flows 
these assumptions are reviewed and updated quarterly  or monthly when events or changes in circumstances occur that could significantly increase the risk of impairment of the asset 
estimates of undiscounted future cash flows and the remaining life of the deferred sales commission asset are made from these assumptions and the aggregate undiscounted future cash flows are compared to the recorded value of the deferred sales commission asset 
management considers the results of these analyses performed at various dates 
as of december   management determined that the deferred sales commission asset was not impaired 
if management determines in the future that the deferred sales commission asset is not recoverable  an impairment condition would exist and a loss would be measured as the amount by which the recorded amount of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value 
estimated fair value is determined using management s best estimate of future cash flows discounted to a present value amount 
goodwill as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill is tested annually  as of september  for impairment 
significant assumptions are required in performing goodwill impairment tests 
such tests include determining whether the estimated fair value of alliancebernstein  the reporting unit  exceeds its book value 
there are several methods of estimating alliancebernstein s fair value  which includes valuation techniques such as market quotations and discounted expected cash flows 
in developing estimated fair value using a discounted cash flow valuation technique  business growth rate assumptions are applied over the estimated life of the goodwill asset and the resulting expected cash flows are discounted to arrive at a present value amount that approximates fair value 
these assumptions consider all material events that have impacted  or that we believe could potentially impact  future discounted expected cash flows 
as of september   the impairment test indicated that goodwill was not impaired 
also  as of december   management believes that goodwill was not impaired 
however  future tests may be based upon different assumptions which may or may not result in an impairment of this asset 
any impairment could reduce materially the recorded amount of the goodwill asset with a corresponding charge to our earnings 
intangible assets acquired intangibles are recognized at fair value and amortized over their estimated useful lives of twenty years 
intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
a present value technique is applied to management s best estimate of future cash flows to estimate the fair value of intangible assets 
estimated fair value is then compared to the recorded book value to determine whether an impairment is indicated 
the estimates used include estimating attrition factors of customer accounts  asset growth rates  direct expenses and fee rates 
we choose assumptions based on actual historical trends that may or may not occur in the future 
as of december   management believes that intangible assets were not impaired 
however  future tests may be based upon different assumptions which may or may not result in an impairment of this asset 
any impairment could reduce materially the recorded amount of intangible assets with a corresponding charge to our earnings 
retirement plan we maintain a qualified  noncontributory  defined benefit retirement plan covering current and former employees who were employed by the company in the united states prior to october  the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements related to the retirement plan are determined from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are assumptions including expected return on plan assets  discount rates at which liabilities could be settled  rates of annual salary increases  and mortality rates 
the assumptions are reviewed annually and may be updated to reflect the current environment 
a summary of the key economic assumptions are described in note to alliancebernstein s consolidated financial statements in item in accordance with us gaap  actual results that differ from those assumed are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  affect expense recognized and liabilities recorded in future periods 
in developing the expected long term rate of return on plan assets of  we considered the historical returns and future expectations for returns for each asset category  as well as the target asset allocation of the portfolio 
the expected long term rate of return on assets is based on weighted average expected returns for each asset class 
we assumed a target allocation weighting of to for equity securities and to for debt securities 
the plan s equity investment strategy seeks to outperform the russell growth index by approximately basis points per year before fees on a consistent basis and to outperform the s p by a similar margin over full market cycles 
the plan s fixed income investment strategy is a defensive mixture invested in both us treasury notes and corporate bonds in an effort to reduce interest rate risk 
the actual rate of return on plan assets was   and in   and  respectively 
a basis point adjustment  up or down  in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would have decreased or increased the net pension charge of million by approximately million 
the objective of our discount rate assumption was to reflect the rate at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled 
in making this determination  we took into account the timing and amount of benefits that would be available under the plan s lump sum option 
to that effect  our methodology for selecting the discount rate as of december  was to match the plan s cash flows to that of a yield curve that provides the equivalent yields on zero coupon corporate bonds for each maturity 
benefit cash flows due in a particular year can be settled theoretically by investing them in the zero coupon bond that matures in the same year 
the discount rate is the single rate that produces the same present value of cash flows 
the selection of the discount rate as of december  represents the approximate mid point to the nearest five basis points of the single rate under two independently constructed yield curves one prepared by mercer human resource consulting which produced a rate of  and one prepared by citigroup which produced a rate of 
the discount rate as of december  was 
this rate was used in developing the net pension charge 
a lower discount rate increases pension expense and the present value of benefit obligations 
a basis point adjustment  up or down  in the discount rate along with a corresponding adjustment in the assumed lump sum interest rate would have decreased or increased the net pension charge of million by approximately million 
loss contingencies management continuously reviews with legal counsel the status of regulatory matters and pending or threatened litigation 
we evaluate the likelihood that a loss contingency exists in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies

the forward looking statements referred to in the preceding paragraph include statements regarding the outcome of litigation and the effect on future earnings of the sale of our cash management services to federated investors  inc sale 
litigation is inherently unpredictable  and excessive judgments do occur 
though we have stated that we do not expect certain legal proceedings to have a material adverse effect on results of operations or financial condition  any settlement or judgment on the merits of a legal proceeding could be significant  and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
the effect of the sale on future earnings  resulting from contingent payments to be received in future periods  will depend on the amount of net revenue earned by federated during these periods on assets under management maintained in federated s funds by our former cash management clients 
the amount of capital gain realized upon closing the transaction depends on the transaction expenses we incur and on an initial payment by federated  some of which would  in certain circumstances  need to be returned
