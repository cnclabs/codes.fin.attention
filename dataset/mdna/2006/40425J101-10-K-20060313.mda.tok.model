item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we begin management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations with a discussion of the critical accounting policies that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results 
in the next section  we present an overview of our business and operations 
this is followed by a discussion of our results of operations  including results of our operating segments  for the past two fiscal years 
we then provide an analysis of our liquidity and capital resources  including discussions of our cash flows  sources of capital and financial commitments 
the following discussions should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this report  including the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing in item of this report  the risk factors appearing in section a of this report and the disclaimer regarding forward looking statements appearing at the beginning of item of this report 
historical results set forth in item and item of this report should not be taken as indicative of our future operations 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition 
we principally recognize revenue for our service offerings when third party payors remit payment to our customers 
this policy is in effect because our fees are principally contingent upon our customers collections from third parties 
due to this revenue recognition policy  our operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter because of the timing of such collections by our customers and the fact that a significant portion of our operating expenses are fixed 
accounting for income taxes 
after utilizing net operating loss carry forwards to offset taxable income in  we have cumulative federal net operating loss carry forwards of million as of december  in addition to other items expensed for financial reporting purposes that were not currently deductible for tax purposes  these net operating loss carryforwards result in gross deferred tax assets 
we must assess the likelihood that the gross deferred tax assets  net of any deferred tax liabilities  will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe the recovery is not likely  we have established a valuation allowance 
significant management judgment is required in determining this valuation allowance 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million as of december   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of the capital loss carryforward from the sale of accordis before it expires 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimate of taxable income and the period over which the net deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that these estimates differ or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
conversely  if we are profitable in the future at levels that cause management to conclude that it is more likely than not that we will realize all or a portion of the net deferred tax assets  for which a valuation is currently provided  we would record the estimated net realizable value of the net deferred tax asset at that time and would then provide income taxes at a rate equal to our combined federal and state effective rate of approximately 
the net deferred tax asset as of december  was million  which is net of a valuation allowance of million 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
goodwill  representing the excess of acquisition costs over the fair value of net assets of acquired businesses  is not amortized but is reviewed for impairment at least annually and written down only in the periods in which it is determined that the recorded value is greater than the fair value 
for the purposes of performing this impairment test  our business segments are our reporting units 
the fair values of those reporting units  to which goodwill has been assigned  is compared with their recorded values 
if recorded values are less than the fair values  no impairment is indicated 
since adoption  no impairment losses have been recorded 

table of contents long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
we determine the recoverability of the carrying value of our long lived assets based on a projection of the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset 
when we determine that the carrying value of long lived assets may not be recoverable  we measure any impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the asset with the fair value of the asset 
for identifiable intangibles  we determine fair value based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate reflective of our cost of funds 
estimating valuation allowances and accrued liabilities  such as bad debts  and restructuring charges 
the preparation of financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
in particular  management must make estimates of the uncollectability of our accounts receivable 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the accounts receivable balance was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of million as of december  as part of the proceeds from the sale of accordis  we received a five year promissory note of million  bearing interest at per annum and requiring semi annual principal payments of  with the balance of million due in a balloon payment on august  at december   the company has a note receivable with a present value of approximately million 
in preparing our financial statements  management is required to assessed the collectibility of this note receivable and has determined that no allowance is required at december  future changes in the assessment of the collectibility of this note receivable could materially impact our results of operations 
management has reviewed its estimates related to restructuring reserve at december  and believes that the estimated liability is based on a reasonable assessment of the probable costs to be incurred 
as additional information becomes available  we may revise our estimates 
such revisions in estimates of the potential restructuring liabilities could materially impact the results of operation and financial position 
discontinued operations 
the accompanying financial statements are prepared using discontinued operations accounting for our discontinued accordis business 
the net assets of accordis sold excluded certain liabilities retained by us of approximately million  consisting principally of liabilities associated with accordis customers and former employees 
a major client of accordis has filed a claim against accordis for certain alleged processing errors in submitting claims on behalf of the client 
in connection with the sale of accordis  the company agreed to indemnify accordis and its buyer with respect to this claim 
see item legal proceedings 
as part of the sale  we also agreed to indemnify the buyer for liabilities in connection with accordis that arose prior to the sale of accordis on august  the buyer agreed to indemnify us for liabilities in connection with accordis that arise after the sale 
there is a minimum indemnification claim threshold of  that is computed after taking into account any insurance proceeds 
our liability under the indemnification provisions of the accordis sale documents is capped at the sale price 
the company is not aware of any potential claims under the indemnification provisions of the sale agreements but in the event that any liabilities should arise from these discontinued operations in excess of the amounts recorded  there could be a material impact on our results of operations 

table of contents new accounting pronouncement 
on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
r supercedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas no 
r is similar to the approach described in sfas however  sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
sfas no 
r must be adopted no later than the first interim or annual period beginning after june  as permitted by sfas no 
 we currently account for share based payments to employees using apb opinion no 
s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
we will adopt sfas no 
r on january  using the modified prospective application option 
as a result  the compensation cost for the portion of awards we granted before january  for which the requisite service has not been rendered and that are outstanding as of january  will be recognized as the remaining requisite service is rendered 
in addition  the adoption of sfas no 
r will require us to change from recognizing the effect of forfeitures as they occur to estimating the number of outstanding instruments for which the requisite service is not expected to be rendered 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas no 
r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our results of operations 
the impact of the adoption of sfas no 
r cannot be determined at this time because it will depend upon levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted sfas r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and net income per share pursuant to sfas no 
in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this form k contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
overview our work is highly customized to the needs of each client  and to the specifications of individual projects 
each client engagement is unique  and requires significant up front investment  sometimes well before the engagement generates revenue 
there are  however  a number of processes that are fundamental to servicing our clients and which cut across all product offerings 
incorporated into these processes are key performance indicators that support our core operating methodology 
one of our most critical resources is the information that we use to identify other available sources of insurance coverage 
in  hms continued to build its proprietary database of insurance eligibility information 
we added more than insurance carriers and other healthcare entities to our network of data exchange partners  representing an addition of million insurance beneficiaries 
we believe this repository of eligibility information is the largest of any vendor in the industry 
at the conclusion of  our data exchange network comprised a total of sources  covering a total of million lives 
in states  we have captured eligibility data for more than of the population 
hms continually strives to maximize the portion of client expenditures that we recover through our proprietary yield management process 
by conducting in depth analyses of our recovery performance from multiple perspectives for example  by comparing results by carrier or by provider our yield management team pinpoints new opportunities to capture recoveries  helps us set measurable goals for improvement  and increases our contingency fee revenue 
we estimate that our yield management process boosts recoveries for clients by to 
in  health management systems submitted approximately million in billings through this process 

table of contents by listening closely to our clients  we often discover the need for a new product or service that provides them long term value 
in  as government healthcare programs focused new attention on payment integrity  hms expanded its menu of overpayment recovery services 
through internal development and strategic partnerships  we gained new tools for identifying and recovering expenditures that result from fraudulent  abusive  or wasteful billing 
we also began our first client engagement devoted solely to overpayment recovery with the idaho medicaid program 
to date  across all our clients  we have recovered a total of more than million in overpayments 
in  we invested significant resources in the development of proprietary tools to streamline the flow of information among clients  payors  and providers 
these tools included cobmanager  our proprietary application for coordinating benefits in near real time  which was implemented fully among pharmacy providers on behalf of our new jersey medicaid client 
by strengthening communication among our company and our clients  we believe we will better serve clients  and better participate in healthcare s open information environment 
leveraging our work on behalf of state medicaid programs  hms has successfully penetrated the medicaid managed care market 
medicaid health plans represent a burgeoning opportunity for our company  especially as medicaid moves more and more of its membership to these plans 
we see additional opportunity among the plans that now are beginning to serve the medicare program either as medicare advantage contractors  which provide a full array of health benefits  or medicare prescription drug plans  which offer the new drug benefit under medicare part d 
in  we cultivated new resources to pursue these opportunities 
we restructured hms operations and services  forming two dedicated business units government services and managed care services 
by channeling distinct capabilities to their respective markets  we expect these units to propel our growth in the coming years 
at the conclusion of we counted health plans including several of the largest in the nation as our clients 
holdings revenue  most of which is derived from contingent fees  has grown approximately per year for the last four years 
this growth has been partly attributable to the growth in medicaid costs  which has averaged approximately annually 
state governments also have increased their use of vendors for coordination of benefits and other cost containment functions  and we have been able to increase our revenue through the initiatives previously discussed 
while there is no certainty that holdings will be successful in obtaining new contracts  expanding existing contracts  or continuing to leverage internal initiatives to support growth  we are projecting that holdings revenue will grow approximately in it should be noted that the nature of our business sometimes leads to significant variations in revenue flow 
for example  since we receive contingency fees for nearly all our services  we recognize revenue only after our clients have received payment from a third party 
in addition  much of our work occurs on an annual or project specific basis  and does not necessarily recur monthly or quarterly  as our operating expenses do 
see a more detailed discussion in item a 
risk factors 
as a service company  to of our operating expenses are compensation 
we adjust our employee headcount based on known business needs and expectations about the near term future 
based on recent operating results  we realize that compensation expense does tend to grow with increases in revenue although not on a proportional basis  since many employee functions do not require additional staff as revenue increases 
our revenue growth over the past several years has not resulted in significant changes in occupancy expenses 
data processing expenses have increased over the past year as we have increased capacity in our mainframe environment operation while incurring expenses related to migrating from the mainframe environment to a primarily server based platform by direct project expenses are incurred based on the requirements of each client engagement 
on average  these expenses have amounted to approximately to of revenues annually 
other operating expenses reflect the customary costs of doing business  such as insurance  legal fees  accounting and tax fees  and costs associated with the requirements of being a publicly traded company 
significant components of this expense category are costs of necessary external professional services  travel and entertainment  employee recruiting  training  and office materials 

table of contents the following discussions reflect the results of accordis as discontinued operations in all periods presented 
for periods prior to august  the date of the sale of accordis  the results of accordis presented as discontinued operations include that portion of corporate overheads directly attributable to accordis 
concurrently with the accordis sale  we also entered into several other agreements including i a three year data services agreement dsa to provide data processing services to accordis holding corp 
ahc  the purchaser of accordis  for million per annum ii a sublease agreement with ahc for the portion of one floor at its headquarters previously occupied by the accordis business for months at an annual rent of million and iii a short term transition services agreement with ahc to provide accounting and human resource support services at cost through december  
as the continuing operations are providing services to accordis under these agreements  in periods subsequent to august   costs previously attributed to discontinued operations are now presented as part of continuing operations 
years ended december  and continuing operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain items in our consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of revenue years ended december  revenue cost of services compensation data processing occupancy direct project costs other operating costs total cost of services operating income net interest income income from continuing operations before income taxes income taxes income from continuing operations income from discontinued operations loss on sale of discontinued operations net income operating results revenue for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million or compared to revenue of million in the prior fiscal year ended december  hms  which provides third party liability identification and recovery services to state medicaid agencies and managed care plans  generated revenue of million in  a million or increase over the prior year revenue of million 
revenue from state medicaid agencies increased by million across the comparable client base reflecting specific non recurring revenue opportunities with certain clients based on their particular needs  differences in the timing of when client projects were completed in the current year compared to the 
table of contents prior year  and changes in the volume  yields and scope of client projects 
non recurring revenue opportunities are generally situations where we have an opportunity to earn additional revenue from a client that we do not expect will recur in the current year or that did not exist in the prior year 
included in revenue generated from the comparable client base was million of revenue for a client whose contract has expired 
revenue from this client is expected to continue through the second quarter of revenue from new state contracts executed in is expected to more than offset this revenue reduction in in addition  million of the revenue increase in resulted from service expansions for two existing state clients 
finally  revenue from managed care plans in was million  an increase of million from the prior year revenue 
at december   we had managed care plan clients that contributed million of revenue in the last quarter of out of the total million of managed care revenue for the entire year 
rsg  which provides reimbursement services for hospitals  generated revenue of million in  a million or increase from the prior year revenue of million 
this growth primarily reflected an increase of million across the comparable client base resulting from the cost report adjudication timetable of the medicare intermediaries 
additional revenue for the current year included a million increase from the addition of several low volume clients and expansions in the scope of service provided to to an existing customer 
during the current year  revenue decreased by million related to two contract terminations 
in  we recorded million of revenue from the data processing services performed for accordis for the four month period subsequent to the sale of accordis 
on an annualized basis  we anticipate that revenue for these services will be million 
compensation expense as a percentage of revenue was in the current year compared to in the prior year and for was million  an increase of million  or from the prior year period expense of million 
this dollar increase resulted principally from higher headcount for the year ended december   we had an average of employees  compared to an average of employees for the year ended december   an increase of 
additionally  compensation expense increased due to general increases in compensation rates  the cost of employee benefits and a million separation payment to the company s chairman of the board  which expense will not be recurring in data processing expense as a percentage of revenue was in the current fiscal year compared to in the prior fiscal year and for was million  an increase of million or compared to the prior year expense of million 
the current year increase is primarily due to the cost of increased capacity in our mainframe environment operation driven by increased revenue in the hms business  together with expenses related to migrating operations from the mainframe environment to a primarily server based platform 
at the end of  we purchased and will bring online in early sufficient mainframe capacity to handle our projected transaction volumes until we complete the server migration project in data processing expenses in are expected to approximate million  a increase from levels 
occupancy expense as a percentage of revenue was in the current year compared to in the prior year and for was million  an increase of million or from the prior year expense of million 
this net increase principally reflects additional occupancy costs for continuing operations over and above sublease income charged to the new owners of accordis 
direct project expense as a percentage of revenue was in the current year compared to in the prior year and for was million  an increase of million or from the prior fiscal year expense of million 
this increase reflects a million increase in expense related to hms and a million increase in expense related to rsg 
the hms increase resulted from the participation of subcontractors in the delivery of services related to revenue growth 
the rsg increase was principally due to million in bad debt expense 
other operating expenses as a percentage of revenue were in the current year compared to in the prior year and for were million  an increase of million or compared to the prior year expense of million 
this net increase primarily resulted from increased professional fees associated with state and federal procurements and new business development expenses 

table of contents operating income for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the prior year 
hms had an operating profit of million for the year ended december  compared to million in the prior year 
the increase in hms operating profitability largely reflects the increase in revenue partially offset by increased direct costs and compensation expense as discussed above 
rsg had an operating margin of million for the year ended december  compared to million for the prior year 
costs associated with data processing and general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million in the prior year 
subsequent to the sale of accordis  data processing costs that were previously attributable to discontinued operations are allocable to continuing operations and are billed to accordis 
in and  our income tax expense principally consisted of an alternative minimum tax liability and state taxes 
we recognized decreases in the valuation allowance related to our ability to realize our deferred tax assets of and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  resulting from our utilization of net operating loss carry forwards nols to offset taxable income 
at december   we had a valuation allowance of million 
the sale of accordis resulted in a capital loss of million  which can be carried forward for five years and produced a deferred tax asset of million 
we believe the available objective evidence  principally the capital loss carryforward being utilizable to offset only future capital gains  creates sufficient uncertainty regarding the realizability of its capital loss carryforward  that it is more likely than not  that substantially all of the capital loss carryforward is not realizable 
the remaining valuation allowance of million relates to certain state nols where the company doesn t operate currently and there is sufficient doubt about the company s ability to utilize these nols  that it is more likely than not that this portion of the state nols are not realizable 
the company does not anticipate that valuation allowance will be available in to reduce tax expense 
net interest income of million in fiscal year compared to  in the prior year reflects a shift to municipal auction rate securities  an increase in market rates and an overall increase in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
income from continuing operations was million in the current year compared to million in the prior year 
the million increase in income largely reflects the increase in revenue partially offset by increases in operating expenses as discussed above as well as the increase in net interest income 
as more fully discussed in item business  and in note b and note b of the notes to consolidated financial statements  we reported the results of accordis as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
loss from discontinued operations in of million was principally attributable to a million loss on sale that was partially offset by income from accordis operations prior to the sale of million 
in the prior year  accordis had income from operations of million reflecting a full year of operations 

table of contents years ended december  and continuing operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain items in our consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of revenue years ended december  revenue cost of services compensation data processing occupancy direct project costs other operating costs restructuring costs total cost of services operating income net interest income income from continuing operations before income taxes income taxes income from continuing operations income from discontinued operations net income revenue for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million or compared to revenue of million in the prior fiscal year ended december  hms generated revenue of million in  a million or increase over the prior year revenue of million 
this increase primarily reflected million of revenue during the current year from two new state and one managed health plan clients and million related to the expansion of services for two existing clients 
in addition  revenue increased by million across the comparable client base reflecting specific non recurring revenue opportunities with certain clients based on their particular needs  differences in the timing of when client projects were completed in the current year compared with the prior year  and changes in the volume  yields and scope of client projects 
non recurring revenue opportunities are generally situations where we have an opportunity to earn additional revenue from a client which we do not expect will recur in the current year or which did not exist in the prior year 
there were no client terminations during rsg generated revenue of million in  a million or increase from the prior year revenue of million 
this increase primarily consisted of million of revenue from new customers since the prior year period  million of revenue from scope or facility expansions from existing clients  and a million increase across the comparable client base 
partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in revenue due to a contract expiration 
compensation expense as a percentage of revenue was in compared to in and for was million  an increase of million  or from the prior year period expense of million 
this dollar increase resulted from general increases in compensation rates and the cost of employee benefits 
for the 
table of contents year ended december   we had an average of employees  compared to an average of employees for the year ended at december   an increase of 
data processing expense as a percentage of revenue was in compared to in and for was million  an increase of million or compared to the prior year expense of million 
this increase was due to increased software costs 
occupancy expense as a percentage of revenue was in compared to in and for was million  an increase of million or from the prior year expense of million 
this net increase principally reflects space expansion in our dallas service center and various other client service offices 
direct project expense as a percentage of revenue was in both and and for was million  an increase of million or from the prior fiscal year expense of million 
this increase is consistent with a increase in revenue 
other operating expenses as a percentage of revenue were in compared to in the prior year and for were million  an increase of million or compared to the expense in of million 
this net increase resulted from million in expenses for professional fees associated with sarbanes oxley act compliance partially offset by reductions of general corporate legal fees 
there were no restructuring costs in the current year  compared to million in the prior year  reflecting an additional charge associated with an increase in the real estate tax rate on sublet office space 
operating income for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the prior year 
hms had an operating profit of million for the year ended december  compared to million in the prior year 
the increase in hms operating profitability largely reflects the increase in revenue partially offset by increased direct costs and compensation expense as discussed above 
rsg had an operating margin of million for the year ended december  compared to million for the prior year 
the increase in rsg operating profitability largely reflects the increase in revenue partially offset by increased compensation and other expenses  partially offset by reductions in direct project expense 
costs associated with data processing and general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million in the prior year 
these were primarily savings related from the non recurring nature of the million in restructuring costs recognized in the year ended december   together with some compensation related savings 
in  we recognized income tax expense of  principally an alternative minimum tax liability resulting from our utilization of existing net operating loss carryforwards to offset current taxable income 
in  we recognized  in alternative minimum tax liabilities 
we have incurred significant taxable losses in prior years 
most of our deferred income tax assets are in the form of net operating loss carry forwards 
a recoverability analysis was performed based on our recent taxable loss history and projections of future taxable operating results 
net interest income of  in fiscal year compared with  in the prior year reflects an increase in market interest rates 
income from continuing operations was million in compared with million in the prior year 
the million increase in income largely reflects the effects of increased revenue  particularly in our hms business 
discontinued operations as more fully discussed in item business  and note b and note b of the notes to consolidated financial statements  we reported the results of accordis as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
income from discontinued operations increased to million in from million in the prior year 
this increase was principally attributable to the increased revenue 
in both periods  the results of discontinued operations 
table of contents reflect only that portion of corporate overhead directly attributable to accordis and not a full allocation of corporate overhead 
additionally  in  there was million of income from operations discontinued in off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
liquidity and capital resources historically  our principal sources of funds are operations 
at december   our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments and working capital were million and million  respectively 
although we expect that operating cash flows will be a primary source of liquidity  the current significant cash and short term investment balances and working capital position are also fundamental sources of liquidity and capital resource 
the current cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances are more than sufficient to meet our short term funding needs that are not met by operating cash flows 
operating cash flows could be adversely affected by a decrease in demand for our services 
our typical customer relationship  however  usually has a duration of several years  such that we do not expect any current decrease in demand 
we estimate that we will purchase approximately million of property and equipment during the payments due by period for our contractual obligations  consisting principally of facility lease obligations and equipment rental and software license obligations  are as follows in thousands less than total one year years years after years operating leases we have entered into sublease arrangements for some of our facility obligations and expect to receive the following rental receipts in thousands less than total one year years years after years for the year ended december   cash provided by operations was million compared with million for the prior year 
the current year cash provided by operations of million primarily results from million of net income plus depreciation and amortization charges of million  and an increase in current liabilities of million reduced by an increase in accounts receivable of million 
during the current year  cash used in investing activities was million reflecting the net purchase of million in short term investments  purchases of million for property and equipment  and a million investment in software 
the current year capital expenditures include approximately million related to increased capacity in our data processing operation that was accelerated into fiscal year to take advantage of favorable vendor pricing 
inflation historically  inflation has not been a material factor affecting our revenue  and general operating expenses have been subject to normal inflationary pressure 
however  our business is labor intensive 
wages and other employee related expenses increase during periods of inflation and when shortages in the skilled labor market occur 
we also have a performance based bonus plan to foster retention of and to incentivize certain employees
