item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
executive overview the company is a specialty retailer of private label  sophisticated  casual to dressy clothing  intimates  complementary accessories  and other non clothing gift items operating under the chico s  wh bm  and soma by chico s soma brand names 
in fiscal and beyond  the company will also be operating under the fitigues brand name 
chico s  which began operations in  focuses on fashion conscious women who are and over with a moderate to high income level 
the styling interprets fashion trends in a unique  relaxed  figure flattering manner using mainly easy care fabrics 
wh bm  which the company acquired in september and which began operations in  targets middle to upper income women who are years old and up 
the styling is contemporary  feminine and unique  assorted primarily in the classic and timeless colors of white and black and related shades 
soma was initially launched in august this concept offers foundation products in intimate apparel  sleepwear  and activewear that is aimed at the chico s target customer  but with focus and styling that is expected to ultimately appeal to a broader customer base 
fitigues  which the company acquired in early fiscal and which began operations in  targets women who are years old and up 
fitigues is a fitness inspired brand  offering stylish yet comfortable activewear clothing 
the company earns revenues and generates cash through the sale of merchandise in its retail stores  to its chico s franchisees  and through its call centers  which handle sales related to the chico s  soma  wh bm and fitigues catalog and online operations 
since the company opened its first chico s store in principally selling folk art  its retail store system  now selling principally women s apparel  has grown to stores as of march   of which are company owned chico s stores  are chico s franchised stores  are wh bm stores  are soma stores and are fitigues stores 
during fiscal  the company opened net new company owned stores and its franchisees opened two new stores 
in early fiscal  the company acquired the fitigues brand and its retail store locations 
from january  through january   the company opened new company owned stores  acquired one store from a franchisee  and one franchisee opened four new franchised stores 
of the new company owned stores  were opened in fiscal  were opened in fiscal net of the former pazo stores that were closed and converted into wh bm stores and soma stores  were opened in fiscal  were opened in fiscal  and were opened in fiscal during this same time period  the company closed company owned stores and no franchised stores were closed 
front line company owned stores  including all chico s and wh bm front line stores  all fitigues front line stores and soma front line stores that are not boutique style stores are considered full line stores 
the company expects to open approximately net new full line company owned stores during fiscal year of this total  are expected to be chico s stores  are expected to be wh bm stores and are expected to be soma stores 
in addition to the net new full line company owned stores to be opened in fiscal  the company also plans to add an additional soma boutique stores to be located adjacent to or within chico s front line stores 
the company is still evaluating whether it will open any new fitigues stores in fiscal and may do so on an opportunistic basis 
in addition  the company is evaluating certain existing company owned store locations  including stores with leases coming up for renewal  and is considering the possibility of closing between existing chico s stores  wh bm stores and fitigues store in fiscal in september  the company acquired the white house  inc  and its concept  wh bm  for approximately million  of which approximately million consisted of cash consideration net of cash acquired and the balance consisted of the company s common stock 
the white house  inc was a privately 
table of contents held retailer  which operated stores in states  puerto rico and the us virgin islands  on the closing date of the acquisition 
the primary factors which historically have influenced the company s profitability and success have been its growth in number of stores  its growth in comparable store sales  and its strong operating margin arising out of favorable gross margin and leverage of operating costs 
in the last five years the company has grown from stores as of january  to stores as of january   which includes the significant store growth resulting from the acquisition of wh bm in fiscal the company continues to expand its presence through the opening of new stores  the development of new opportunities such as soma and through the extension of its merchandise line 
the company anticipates that its rate of growth measured by overall growth in sales  growth in comparable store sales  and other factors can be expected to decrease including a decrease from the rate of overall sales growth experienced in recent years which has been in the range of  such anticipated decrease in rate of growth reflecting in large part the company s significantly increased size  its more manageable net square footage growth goal for fiscal and net square footage growth goal in fiscal and the expectation that its same store sales increases will moderate 
nevertheless  even at a reduced growth rate  the company expects to continue its ability to generate the necessary cash flow to fund its expansion and to take advantage of new opportunities 
the company has no long term debt and foresees no current need to incur long term debt to support its continued growth 
factors that will be critical to determining the company s future success include  among others  managing the overall growth strategy  including the ability to open and operate stores effectively  maximizing efficiencies in the merchandising  product development and sourcing processes  maintaining high standards for customer service and assistance  maintaining the newness  fit and comfort in its merchandise offerings  customer acceptance of new store concepts  effectively integrating acquired businesses  effectively maturing the newer brand concepts  effectively implementing the process of senior management succession  and generating cash to fund the company s expansion needs 
in order to monitor the company s success  the company s senior management monitors certain key performance indicators  including comparable same store sales growth in fiscal  the company s comparable store sales growth sales from stores open for at least twelve full months  including stores that have been expanded or relocated within the same general market was 
this increase represents the ninth consecutive year in which the company has experienced double digit comparable store sales growth 
the company believes that comparable store sales growth  although not necessarily double digit growth  is a critical success factor and a positive indication of the company s ability to manage its expansion and its ability to operate stores effectively 
maintaining comparable same store sales growth over an extended period of time into the future can be impacted by saturation  customer receptiveness to new product offerings and price elasticity  among other factors 
in october  the acquired wh bm stores entered into the comparable store base 
as a result  the ability of the company to maintain strong comparable same store sales increases within the wh bm stores will be important to the ability of the company to continue its comparable same store sales growth 
also  beginning in september  soma stores entered the comparable store base  however  due to the small number of stores  these stores have not had a material impact on the comparable stores sales calculation 
the recently acquired fitigues stores will not enter the comparable store base until february positive operating cash flow in fiscal  the company generated million of cash flow from operations compared with million in fiscal  which represents an increase of 
the company believes a key strength of its business is the historical ability to consistently generate cash flow from operations 
strong cash flow generation is critical to the future success of the company  not only to support the general operating needs of the company  but also to fund capital expenditures related to new store openings  relocations  expansions and remodels  additional infrastructure costs associated with the distribution center  costs associated with the company s proposed new corporate headquarters expansion project  costs associated with continued improvement of information technology tools and costs associated with potential strategic acquisitions that may arise from time to time 
cash flow can be negatively impacted by a slow down in sales  higher costs of goods sold as a 
table of contents percentage of sales and increased selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales 
see further discussion of the company s cash flows in the liquidity and capital resources section 
loyalty clubs management believes that a significant indicator of the company s success is the growth of the its loyalty programs  the passport club and the black book  and support for such loyalty programs from its personalized customer service training programs and its marketing initiatives 
the passport club  the chico s and soma frequent shopper club  features discounts and other special promotions for its members 
preliminary members may join the passport club at no cost and upon spending  customers automatically become permanent members and are entitled to a lifetime discount and other benefits 
during fiscal  the company added approximately  net new permanent passport club members and approximately  net new preliminary passport club members 
in fiscal  permanent passport club members accounted for approximately of overall sales  about the same as in fiscal and preliminary members accounted for approximately of overall sales 
the company believes that the growth of its passport club indicates that the company is still generating strong interest from new customers  many of whom tend to become long term loyal customers  due in large part to the company s commitment to personalized customer service and constant newness of product 
the company introduced a new frequent shopper program at its wh bm stores during october called the black book 
the black book loyalty program is similar to the passport club in all key respects except that members become permanent upon spending  compared to for the passport club 
during fiscal  wh bm added approximately  net new permanent black book members and approximately  preliminary black book members 
in fiscal  the permanent black book members accounted for of overall sales  while preliminary members accounted for of overall sales 
quality and merit of merchandise offerings to monitor and maintain the acceptance of its merchandise offerings  the company monitors sell through levels  inventory turns  gross margins and markdown rates on a classification and style level 
although the company does not disclose these statistics for competitive reasons  this analysis helps identify comfort  fit and newness issues at an early date and helps the company plan future product development and buying 
the company continues to evaluate and monitor the progress of its soma stores  its intimate apparel initiative and it plans to open additional full line soma stores in fiscal and also plans to add soma boutique stores to be located within or adjacent to chico s front line stores 
the company recognizes that the soma business can be seen as complementary to its basic apparel business  but it also understands that many aspects of this business require unique attention 
the company monitors soma merchandise offerings in a manner similar to its other brands with special emphasis on repeat purchases 
the company anticipates that additional investment will be required to establish the soma brand as an acceptable business meeting the profitability goals of the company over the longer term 
the company believes the soma brand reduced the company s operating margin by approximately basis points for fiscal and the company anticipates this could increase slightly in fiscal considering the additional new soma stores planned 
the company further believes that an impact on operating margin of this order is acceptable when balanced against the possibility of the brand s perceived longer term growth potential 
in fiscal year  the company reported net sales  operating income and net income of billion  million and million  respectively  up  and  from the prior fiscal year 
the company s gross margin decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increases in operating income and net income benefited significantly from the leverage associated with the company s fiscal comparable store sales increase of 
sales and profitability trends are further discussed in the results of operations section 

table of contents results of operations net sales the following table shows net sales by company owned chico s soma stores  net sales by company owned wh bm stores  net sales by catalog and internet  and net sales to franchisees in dollars and as a percentage of total net sales for the fiscal years ended january  fiscal or current period  january  fiscal or prior period and january  fiscal dollar amounts in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal net sales by chico s soma stores net sales by wh bm stores net sales by catalog and internet net sales to franchisees net sales net sales by company owned stores increased over the past three years  both in the aggregate and separately by brand  primarily due to new store openings  the acquisition of the white house  inc on september   as well as the current trend of strong increases in the company s comparable store net sales including stores within the comparable store base that have been expanded or relocated within the same general market 
fiscal and includes full months of net sales for wh bm stores whereas fiscal only includes approximately months of net sales for wh bm running from the date of the acquisition 
a summary of the factors impacting year over year sales increases is provided in the table below dollar amounts in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal comparable store sales increases comparable same store sales new store sales increases number of new company owned stores opened  net stores acquired in the wh bm acquisition are not counted as new company owned stores opened  and such stores were also not included in the computation of comparable same store sales until october the comparable store sales increase of in fiscal was driven primarily by an increase in the number of transactions compared to fiscal and  to a lesser extent  from an increase of in the chico s average unit retail price and an increase of in the average unit retail price for wh bm which average unit retail price is a financial indicator  the percentage change of which is believed by management to represent a reasonable approximation of the percentage change in company store net sales attributable to price changes or mix 
in fiscal  wh bm same store sales represented approximately of the total same store sales base compared to in fiscal the wh bm same store sales increase for fiscal was in the mid to high thirty percent range while the chico s same store sales increase for fiscal was in the low double digit range 
the comparable store sales increase of in fiscal was driven primarily by an increase in the number of transactions compared to fiscal and  to a lesser extent  from an increase of in the chico s average unit retail price 
wh bm stores were included in the comparable store sales calculation beginning in october  which was full months after the acquisition date of september  for fiscal  wh bm sales prior to october are included in new store sales 
sales from wh bm stores since the date of acquisition on september  and through the end of fiscal were included in new store sales for fiscal and no such sales were included in fiscal comparable store sales 
sales from soma stores in fiscal were included in the comparable store sales calculation beginning in september and did not have a material 
table of contents impact on the calculation while in fiscal  all other sales from soma stores were included in new store sales 
the recently acquired fitigues stores will not enter into the comparable store base until february sales from the company s discontinued pazo store concept in fiscal and have been included in the new store sales for the applicable periods and no such sales are included in comparable store sales 
net sales by catalog and internet for fiscal which included mostly chico s and wh bm merchandise and a small offering of soma merchandise increased by million  or  compared to net sales by catalog and internet for fiscal it is believed that the increase was principally attributable to the increased circulation of catalog mailings and additional television spots in fiscal compared to fiscal and  to a lesser extent  the launch of the wh bm website in august providing wh bm customers with the opportunity to purchase merchandise over the internet and through its catalog 
net sales by catalog and internet for fiscal which only included chico s and a small offering of soma merchandise increased by million  or  compared to net sales by catalog and internet for fiscal it is believed that the increase was principally attributable to the increased page count and number of catalog mailings and additional television spots in the current year versus the prior period 
cost of goods sold gross profit the following table shows cost of goods sold and gross profit in dollars and the related gross profit percentages for fiscal  and dollar amounts in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal cost of goods sold gross profit gross profit percentage the decrease in the gross profit percentage from fiscal to fiscal resulted primarily from a decrease in the merchandise margins at the company s outlet stores  from the company s continued investment in its soma and wh bm brands  which generate somewhat lower gross margins soma merchandise margins were approximately percentage points lower than the merchandise margins at chico s and wh bm merchandise margins were just under percentage points lower than the merchandise margins at chico s  and to a lesser extent  from the company s continued investment in the product development and merchandising functions for all of its brands as well as from slightly increased inventory clearance costs 
these decreases in gross profit percentage were partially offset by an improvement of approximately basis points in the merchandise margins at wh bm front line stores 
the improvement of merchandise margins at the wh bm front line stores resulted primarily from improved initial markups on new products  moderated in part by a higher markdown rate compared to the prior period 
the gross profit percentage for chico s front line stores improved slightly  approximately basis points  for the current period compared to the prior period primarily due to improved initial markups on new products offset by a higher markdown rate compared to the prior period 
the company has accelerated the rollout plans for new stores in fiscal for soma and wh bm with the goal of moving more quickly to profitability in the soma brand and to take advantage of the positive momentum of the wh bm brand 
each of these growth strategies is likely to have some short term downward impact on both gross margins and operating margins  which the company began to experience in the fourth quarter of fiscal the company expects there will be continued pressure on the overall gross margin for each quarter of fiscal  likely to be in the range of to basis points quarter over comparable quarter  with the first half of fiscal being less impacted than the second half of the fiscal year 
in addition  like many other companies  the company s gross margin will be negatively impacted by the initial adoption of sfas r 
the increase in the gross profit percentage from fiscal to fiscal was positively impacted by improved margins at the chico s front line stores mainly due to improved initial merchandise markups which were offset  to a lesser degree  by increased markdowns as a percent of net sales and  to a lesser extent  from significantly improved margins at the company s outlet stores 
also  but to a lesser degree  the gross profit percentage was positively impacted by operating efficiencies associated with the company s new distribution 
table of contents center the costs of which are included in the company s cost of goods sold 
the gross profit percentage was adversely impacted by wh bm sales  which carried a lower gross profit percentage than sales at chico s front line stores wh bm merchandise margins were approximately percentage points lower than the merchandise margins at chico s and an increase in product development costs  as a percentage of net sales  primarily due to an investment in the wh bm merchandise and product development teams and costs associated with the launch of the soma brand in the third quarter of fiscal to a lesser extent  the gross profit percentage was adversely impacted by increased inventory clearance costs 
general  administrative and store operating expenses the following table shows general  administrative and store operating expenses in dollars and as a percentage of total net sales for fiscal  and dollar amounts in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal general  administrative and store operating expenses percentage of total net sales the increase in general  administrative and store operating expenses in dollars was  for the most part  the result of increases in the company s store operating expenses  including associate compensation  occupancy and other costs associated with additional store openings and  to a lesser degree  an increase in marketing expenses and other general corporate infrastructure costs to support the company s rapid growth  including expenses related to housing of off site business units 
general  administrative and store operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased basis points over the prior period primarily because there was million of rent expense included in fiscal related to prior fiscal years see further discussion below to adjust the company s presentation of rent expense with no comparable expense in fiscal general  administrative and store operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was also positively impacted by a significant decrease in wh bm store operating expenses primarily in personnel and occupancy costs as a percentage of total net sales over the prior period resulting from leverage associated with the wh bm comparable store sales increase in the mid to high thirty percent range 
these decreases in general  administrative and store operating expenses as a percentage of total net sales were partially offset by increased incentive compensation as a result of the company s strong financial performance 
as a result of the company s decision to accelerate the rollout plans for new stores in fiscal for soma and wh bm and certain longer term initiatives in the management information systems and store payroll areas  the company expects there could be a slightly higher level of general  administrative and store operating expenses as a percentage of net sales in fiscal nevertheless  the company is optimistic that it will be able to manage these increased costs so as to mitigate the extent of any negative impact on the percentage 
in addition  like many other companies  the company s general  administrative and store operating expenses will be negatively impacted by the initial adoption of sfas r 
the company anticipates that these new equity compensation expensing requirements will have the effect of reducing annual earnings in fiscal by between eight and nine cents per diluted share 
in fiscal  general  administrative and store operating expenses were impacted by the company s decision  in connection with a review of its accounting practices relating to leasing transactions  to record a one time  non cash adjustment related to the timing of rent expense for store locations 
previously  the company followed a practice prevalent across the retailing industry  in which it recognized the straight line rent expense for leases beginning generally on the earlier of the store opening date or lease commencement date  which had the effect of excluding the build out period of its stores from the calculation of the period over which it expensed rent 
the company now records rent expense when it takes possession of a store  which occurs before the commencement of the lease term or approximately days prior to the opening of the store 
this adjustment resulted in a one time  cumulative  non cash increase to rent expense of approximately million pre tax 
of the million pre tax expense recorded in fiscal  million was attributable to the current year and million pre tax  was related to prior fiscal years 

table of contents furthermore  in fiscal  the company revised the manner in which it accounts for construction allowances from landlords of properties leased by the company for its stores 
for fiscal and for future fiscal years  construction allowances are amortized as a reduction of rent expense  rather than being amortized as a reduction of depreciation expense  which was the approach followed in fiscal years prior to for fiscal  the impact of amortizing construction allowances as a reduction of rent expense rather than as a reduction of depreciation expense resulted in a decrease to rent expense of approximately million 
the net impact of these two lease accounting adjustments was immaterial to general  administrative and store operating expenses in total and as a percentage of total net sales 
general  administrative and store operating expenses in fiscal as a percentage of net sales improved basis points over fiscal primarily because there was million of store closing costs associated with the conclusion of the pazo test concept included in fiscal with no comparable expense in fiscal general  administrative and store operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was positively impacted during fiscal by decreases in chico s store operating expenses as a percentage of net sales compared to fiscal due primarily to leverage improvements in store personnel and occupancy costs associated with the company s current period comparable store sales increase of 
this improvement was offset to a lesser extent by costs associated with the wh bm store operating expenses  which tend to run higher than chico s store operating expenses as a percentage of net sales 
store operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was also negatively impacted  but to an even lesser degree  by increased marketing costs as a percentage of net sales  costs related to the interim continuation of the wh bm corporate headquarters and related functions  and costs associated with the company s sarbanes oxley initiatives 
depreciation and amortization the following table shows depreciation and amortization in dollars and as a percentage of total net sales for fiscal  and dollar amounts in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal depreciation and amortization percentage of total net sales the increase in depreciation and amortization expense from fiscal to fiscal was  for the most part  due to capital expenditures related to new  remodeled and expanded stores 
the increase in depreciation and amortization expense from fiscal to fiscal was  for the most part  due to capital expenditures related to new  remodeled and expanded stores 
depreciation and amortization expense  in dollars and as a percentage of total net sales  was also impacted by the company s revision to the manner in which it accounts for construction allowances from landlords of properties leased by the company for its stores  as discussed above 
the impact of this revision was to increase depreciation expense in fiscal by approximately million with an offsetting decrease in rent expense of million 
provision for income taxes the company s effective tax rate was and for fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective tax rate for fiscal was primarily attributable to favorable permanent differences  including higher tax free interest  as well as a slightly favorable change in the company s overall state effective tax rate 
the company expects that its effective tax rate for fiscal will be slightly favorable compared to the effective tax rate for fiscal 
table of contents net income the following table shows net income in dollars and as a percentage of total net sales for fiscal  and dollar amounts in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal net income percentage of total net sales comparable company store net sales comparable company store net sales increased by in the weeks ended january  when compared to the comparable prior period 
comparable company store net sales data is calculated based on the change in net sales of currently open company owned stores that have been operated as a company store for at least twelve full months  including stores that have been expanded or relocated within the same general market area approximately five miles 
the comparable store percentage reported above includes stores that were expanded or relocated within the last two fiscal years by an average of selling square feet 
if the stores that were expanded and relocated had been excluded from the comparable company owned store base  the increase in comparable company owned store net sales would have been for fiscal versus as reported 
the company does not consider the effect to be material to the overall comparable store sales results and believes the inclusion of expanded stores in the comparable store net sales to be an acceptable practice  consistent with the practice followed by the company in prior periods and by some other retailers 
wh bm stores acquired in the white house  inc acquisition were included in the comparable store sales calculation for the first time beginning in october and wh bm stores opened since the acquisition are treated the same as all other company owned stores 
soma stores began entering into the comparable store sales calculation in september and due to the small number of stores have not had a material impact on the comparable stores sales calculation 
the recently acquired fitigues stores will not enter into the comparable store base until february the company believes that the increase in comparable company store net sales in the current fiscal year resulted from the continuing effort to focus the company s product development  merchandise planning and allocation  buying  technical design  and marketing departments on the company s target customers 
the company also believes that the look  fit and pricing policy of the company s product was in line with the needs of the company s target customers 
in addition  the company believes that the increase in comparable store sales was also fueled by a coordinated marketing plan  which includes national and regional television advertising  national magazine advertising  increased direct mailings of catalogs  a larger database of existing customers for such mailings and the success of the company s frequent shopper clubs 
to a lesser degree  the company believes the increase was due to continued store level training efforts associated with ongoing training programs  the company s overall ability to maintain its high standards for customer service and assistance and to an increase in the average unit retails at both chico s and wh bm stores 
the following table sets forth for each of the quarters of the previous five fiscal years  the percentage change in comparable store net sales at company owned stores from the comparable period in the prior fiscal year fiscal year ended full year first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources overview the company s primary ongoing capital requirements are for funding capital expenditures for new  expanded  relocated and remodeled stores and increased merchandise inventories  for planned expansion of its headquarters and other central support facilities and for continued improvement in information technology tools 
the company anticipates that its current headquarters facility will be insufficient to meet its needs by the end of fiscal accordingly  the company is engaged in strategic long term planning to address its space requirements for the future 
the company s options include expanding its current headquarters facility  building a new headquarters at a different location  or moving into an existing building in a different location 
in order to help with immediate space needs  the company has leased off site space for its call center and finance departments and will likely lease additional off site space to house discrete business units until its long term solution is in place 
the company believes that its long term solution should be in place during fiscal  but that interim leasing of additional space in fiscal  fiscal and early fiscal should adequately address the company s space needs and should not have any material negative impact on the company s overall operations 
also  to a lesser degree  during fiscal  the company experienced the need for working capital to address the launching of its new intimate apparel concept  soma  whose stores began opening during the third quarter of fiscal the following table shows the company s capital resources at the end of fiscal year and amounts in thousands fiscal fiscal cash and cash equivalents marketable securities working capital working capital increased from fiscal to fiscal primarily due to the company s ability to generate significant cash from operating activities in large part due to the company s strong comparable store sales  which cash was substantially more than necessary to satisfy the company s investment in capital expenditures 
the significant components of the company s working capital are cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities and inventories  reduced by accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
based on past performance and current expectations  the company believes that its cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities and cash generated from operations will satisfy the company s working capital needs  capital expenditures see new store openings and headquarters expansion discussed below  commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with the company s operations through at least the next months 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
the cash provided by operating activities for both periods was due to the company s net income adjusted for non cash charges and changes in working capital such as depreciation and amortization expense  normal fluctuations in accounts receivable  inventories  prepaid and other current assets  accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
significant adjustments to net income for fiscal and fiscal consisted of a non cash tax benefit related to the exercise of employee stock options of million and million  respectively 

table of contents investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
the company s investment in capital expenditures during fiscal primarily related to the planning and opening of new  relocated  remodeled and expanded chico s  wh bm  and soma stores million  the purchase of acres in south ft 
myers  florida originally intended for the location of a new corporate headquarters campus million  distribution center infrastructure and expansion costs million  costs associated with system upgrades and new software implementations million and other miscellaneous capital expenditures million 
capital expenditures increased by million from fiscal to fiscal primarily as a result of the purchase of land for purposes of a new headquarters campus  distribution center expansion  and increased information system technology investments related to new technology initiatives 
the company invested million  net  in marketable securities in the current year 
in the prior year  the company invested million in marketable securities 
during fiscal  the company purchased an equity investment in a privately held company for business and strategic purposes totaling million 
in fiscal  the company paid million to acquire the net assets of a franchise store 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the company received proceeds in both fiscal and from the issuance of common stock related to current and former employee option exercises and employee participation in its employee stock purchase plan 
in fiscal  the company satisfied the remaining balances due on capital leases assumed as a result of the white house  inc acquisition totaling million 
in september  the company s board of directors approved the repurchase  over a twelve month period ending in september  of up to million of the company s outstanding common stock 
the company repurchased  shares of its common stock during fiscal in connection with this stock repurchase program  at a total cost of approximately million 
during fiscal  twenty five of the company s thirty seven officers or former officers  its two non officer inside directors  and four of its seven independent directors exercised an aggregate of  stock options at prices ranging from to and several employees and former employees exercised an aggregate of  options at prices ranging from to 
also  during this period  the company sold  and  shares of common stock during the march and september offering periods under its employee stock purchase plan at prices of and  respectively 
the proceeds from these issuances of stock  exclusive of the tax benefit realized by the company  amounted to approximately million 
new store openings and headquarters expansion the company plans to open approximately net new full line company owned stores which includes chico s stores  wh bm stores and new soma stores in fiscal in addition to the net new full line company owned stores to be opened in fiscal  the company also plans to add an additional soma boutique stores to be located adjacent to or within chico s front line stores 
the company believes that the liquidity needed for its planned new store growth including continued investments associated with the decision to grow its new concept  soma  continuing remodel expansion program  acquisition of fitigues and any growth thereof  continued installation and upgrading of new and existing software packages  and maintenance of proper inventory levels associated with this growth will be funded from cash flow from operations and its existing strong cash and marketable securities balances 
during fiscal  the company completed the purchase of acres in south fort myers  florida originally intended for the location of a new corporate headquarters campus for a total acquisition cost of 
table of contents million  which included all transaction costs and million of road impact fees 
the company is reevaluating whether it will build on property adjacent to its metro parkway campus or pursue a new campus 
additionally  the company completed the purchase of a facility adjacent to its winder campus distribution center to be used for all direct to consumer fulfillment ie catalog and internet to address the continuing growth in the volume of direct to consumer chico s sales and the expanded number of direct to consumer items that are being made available with respect to the wh bm and soma brands 
these property purchases were funded from the company s existing cash and marketable securities balances 
the company further believes that this liquidity will be sufficient  based on the above  to fund anticipated capital needs over the near term 
given the company s existing cash and marketable securities balances and the capacity included in its bank credit facilities  the company does not believe that it would need to seek other sources of financing to conduct its operations or pursue its expansion plans even if cash flow from operations should prove to be less than anticipated or if there should arise a need for additional letter of credit capacity due to establishing new and expanded sources of supply  or if the company were to increase the number of new company owned stores planned to be opened  expanded or relocated in future periods 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations at january  amounts in thousands less than after total year years years years long term debt short term borrowings capital lease obligations operating leases non cancelable purchase commitments total as of january   the company s contractual obligations consisted of amounts outstanding under operating leases and non cancelable purchase commitments 
amounts due under non cancelable purchase commitments consists of amounts to be paid under agreements to purchase inventory that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms as well as letters of credit outstanding 
in june  the company entered into the second restated revolving credit loan agreement with bank of america  na the agreement  which replaced the restated revolving credit and term loan agreement dated as of september  on terms and conditions substantially similar to the replaced facility 
the terms of the agreement provide for a million aggregate revolving credit loan commitment  with a letter of credit sublimit of million and a line of credit sublimit of million 
the revolving credit facility initially matures june   but automatically renews for one year periods through at january  and january   the company did not have any relationship with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  of the type  which certain other companies have established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or for other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
therefore  the company is not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if the company had engaged in such relationships 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  
table of contents revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to customer product returns  inventories  income taxes  insurance reserves  contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
inventory valuation the company identifies potentially excess and slow moving inventories by evaluating turn rates and inventory levels in conjunction with the company s overall growth rate 
excess quantities are identified through evaluation of inventory ageings  review of inventory turns and historical sales experiences  as well as specific identification based on fashion trends 
further  exposure to inadequate realization of carrying value is identified through analysis of gross margins and markdowns in combination with changes in the fashion industry 
the company provides lower of cost or market reserves for such identified excess and slow moving inventories 
inventory shrinkage the company estimates its expected shrinkage of inventories between physical inventory counts by applying historical chain wide average shrinkage experience rates to the related periods sales volume 
the historical rates are updated on a regular basis to reflect the most recent physical inventory shrinkage experience 
revenue recognition while the company s recognition of revenue does not involve significant judgment  revenue recognition represents an important accounting policy of the company 
retail sales by company stores are recorded at the point of sale and are net of estimated customer returns  sales discounts under the passport club and the black book loyalty programs and company issued coupons 
retail sales by catalog and internet are recorded when shipments are made to catalog and internet customers and are net of estimated customer returns 
net sales to franchisees are recorded when merchandise is shipped to franchisees and are net of estimated returns 
revenue for gift certificate and gift card sales is recognized at redemption 
under the company s current program  gift certificate and gift card sales do not have expiration dates  and there is no periodic reduction in the company s liability under unredeemed gift certificates and gift cards that would have the effect of reducing the amounts that would eventually be remitted to the states under their respective escheat laws 
the company s policy is to honor customer returns in most instances 
returns after days of the original purchase  or returns without the original receipt  qualify for store credit only 
the company will  in certain circumstances  offer full customer refunds either after days or without a receipt 
the company estimates its reserve for likely customer returns based on the average refund experience in relation to sales for the related period 
evaluation of long lived assets long lived assets are reviewed periodically for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
if future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset are less than its carrying amount  an asset is determined to be impaired  and a loss is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value 
the company uses its best judgment based on the most current facts and circumstances surrounding its business when applying these 
table of contents impairment rules 
changes in assumptions used could have a significant impact on the company s assessment of recoverability 
the company evaluates the recoverability of goodwill at least annually based on a two step impairment test 
the first step compares the fair value of the company s reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount exceeds fair value  then the second step of the impairment test is performed to measure the amount of any impairment loss 
fair value is determined based on estimated future cash flows  discounted at a rate that approximates the company s cost of capital 
the company evaluates its other intangible assets  specifically trademarks  for impairment on an annual basis by comparing the fair value of the asset with its carrying value 
such estimates are subject to change and the company may be required to recognize impairment losses in the future 
self insurance the company is self insured for certain losses relating to workers compensation  medical and general liability claims 
self insurance claims filed and claims incurred but not reported are accrued based upon management s estimates of the aggregate liability for uninsured claims incurred using historical experience 
although management believes it has the ability to adequately accrue for estimated losses related to claims  it is possible that actual results could significantly differ from recorded self insurance liabilities 
income taxes the company records reserves for estimates of probable settlements of tax audits 
at any point in time  many tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions 
the results of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may affect the ultimate settlement of these issues 
the company s effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings and changes in the expected outcome of tax audits 
accounting for contingencies from time to time  the company is subject to various proceedings  lawsuits  disputes and claims actions arising from its normal business activities 
many of these actions raise complex factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties 
accounting for contingencies arising from these actions requires management to use its best judgment when estimating an accrual  if any  related to such contingencies 
management may also consult with outside legal counsel to assist in the estimating process 
however  the ultimate outcome of such actions could be different than management s estimate  and adjustments may be required 
recent accounting pronouncements on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
revised sfas r  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
sfas r supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas r is similar to the approach described in sfas however  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees and directors  including grants of employee and director stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
the provisions of sfas r are effective at the beginning of the company s fiscal year 
therefore  the company will adopt sfas r on january   the beginning of the company s fiscal year  using the modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized for all share based payments granted after january  and all share based payments granted on or prior to january   that remain unvested as of such date 

table of contents as permitted by statement  the company currently accounts for share based payments under apb s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee or director stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas r s fair value method will have a significant impact on the company s results of operations as well as on the comparability of the results of operations for the next several years  although it will have no impact on its overall financial position 
had the company adopted sfas r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note to the consolidated financial statements and the company estimates the compensation expense impact of adopting sfas r for fiscal will be in the range of eight to nine cents per diluted share 
sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption  again impacting the comparability of these financial measures for the next several years 
although the company cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees and directors exercise stock options  the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
seasonality and inflation although the operations of the company are influenced by general economic conditions  the company does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on the results of operations during the current or prior periods 
the company does not consider its business to be seasonal 
the company reports its sales on a monthly basis in line with other public companies in the women s apparel industry 
although the company believes this regular reporting of interim sales may provide for greater transparency to investors  the company is concerned that these interim results tend to be relied upon too heavily as indicative of a trend 
for example  such factors as the weather numerous hurricanes in fiscal and  national events elections  international events and developments in iraq  interest rates  increased oil and other energy costs  changes in the nature of its merchandise promotions  and similar factors can significantly affect the company for a particular period 
in addition  the company s periodic results can be directly and significantly impacted by the extent to which the company s new merchandise offerings are accepted by its customers

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the market risk of the company s financial instruments as of january  has not significantly changed since january  the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on any future indebtedness and its marketable securities 
the company s exposure to interest rate risk relates in part to its revolving line of credit with its bank  however  as of january   the company did not have any outstanding borrowings on its line of credit and  given its strong liquidity position  does not expect to utilize its line of credit in the foreseeable future except for its continuing use of the letter of credit facility portion thereof 
the company s investment portfolio  which has increased significantly in fiscal  is maintained in accordance with the company s investment policy which identifies allowable investments  specifies credit quality standards and limits the credit exposure of any single issuer 
the company s investment portfolio consists of cash equivalents and marketable securities  including variable rate demand notes and auction rate securities  which are highly liquid  variable rate municipal debt securities 
although these securities have long term nominal maturity dates ranging from to  the interest rates are reset  depending on the type of security  every  or days 
despite the long term nature of the underlying securities  the company has the ability to quickly liquidate these securities based on the company s cash needs thereby creating a short term instrument 
accordingly  the company s investments are classified as available for sale securities 
as of january   an increase of basis points in interest rates would reduce the fair value of the company s marketable securities portfolio by approximately million 
conversely  a reduction of basis points in interest rates would increase the fair value of the company s marketable securities portfolio by approximately million
