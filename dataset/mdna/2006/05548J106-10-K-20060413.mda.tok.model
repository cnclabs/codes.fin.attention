item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations unless noted otherwise  the fiscal year ended january  is referred to as other fiscal years are referred to in a similar manner 
general overview bj s is a leading warehouse club operator in the eastern united states 
as of january   we operated bj s warehouse clubs  of which operate gasoline stations  and two profoods restaurant supply clubs  in states 
the success of our business is dependent on our ability to achieve high volumes of sales and rapid inventory turnover  to attract and retain members and to control costs 
we believe that our pricing and cost structure is a major competitive advantage for us 
our revenues are derived from the sale of a wide range of food and general merchandise items  the sale of gasoline and from membership fees 
paid membership is an essential component in our business 
it not only provides a source of revenue  but it promotes customer loyalty 
membership fees permit us to offer lower prices to our members  encouraging them to shop us more frequently 
member renewal rates are a key performance indicator for us 
comparable store sales performance is an important measure throughout the retail industry 
our comparable club sales increase from to was  including a contribution from gasoline of 
this year s comparable club sales performance follows very strong comparable club sales in the last two years 
from to  our comparable club sales increased by  including a contribution from gasoline sales of 
from to comparable club sales increased by  including a contribution from gasoline sales of 
our low merchandise margin rates drive the high sales volumes that are so critical in our business 
our merchandise margin rate is a key metric in achieving both our top line and bottom line objectives 
we believe that the cost structure built into our business model puts us among the most efficient in the retail industry 
we closely monitor our costs as a percentage of sales  particularly our payroll costs  which comprise the largest portion of our selling  general and administrative expenses 
we place a great deal of emphasis on control of our inventories 
because of our high sales volumes and inventory turns  we are able to generate cash from a large portion of our inventory before we are required to pay our merchandise vendors 
the majority of our inventory purchases are routed through our cross dock facilities  including two new state of the art facilities which were built in and we monitor several inventory related measures  including inventory turns  accounts payable as a percentage of inventories  average inventories per club and shrinkage as a percentage of sales 
overview of operations despite lower than planned comparable club sales increases in  we were able to drive earnings growth primarily because of very strong sales increases in private brands and fresh foods  which were priorities for us in reduced purchasing costs driven by global sourcing and e sourcing also helped to fuel merchandise margin expansion 
comparable club sales of food increased by from to  while comparable club sales of general merchandise decreased by over the same period of time 
membership renewal rates dropped slightly from last year s levels 
our percentage of rewards members and the percentage of the sales they generated grew significantly in our balance sheet remains strong 
as of january   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  versus cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million at the end of the previous year 
long term debt  including current installments  was million as of january  net cash provided by operating activities was million in  versus last year s higher than normal total of million 
we opened eight new bj s clubs and replaced one older club with a prototype club in a better location 
we also began construction of a  square foot cross dock facility in uxbridge  massachusetts  that will replace an older  smaller facility in the summer of outlook for our priorities in will be focused on building traffic in our clubs  improving our general merchandise business and accelerating our square footage growth 
traffic building initiatives include newspaper advertising in select markets  as well as direct mail coupon promotions focused on high ticket general merchandise items 
we plan to sharpen our price laddering in general merchandise by simplifying our members selection process by organizing product assortments into three price levels so that they can trade up or down in any given category 
we look to continue building our fresh food business with expanded assortments of produce and home meal replacement items 
in addition to completing construction of our new cross dock facility in uxbridge  ma  we plan to open to new clubs in effective january   we raised the cost of a bj s membership by because membership fees are amortized over twelve months and members renew on anniversary dates throughout the year  the full effect of the fee increase will take two years to cycle 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we review our estimates on an ongoing basis and make judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities based on a number of factors 
these factors include historical experience  guidance provided by outside experts and assumptions made by management that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
this section summarizes critical accounting policies and the related judgments involved in their application 
cash consideration received from vendors we receive various types of cash consideration from vendors  principally in the form of rebates and allowances 
we recognize such vendor rebates and allowances as a reduction of cost of sales based on a systematic and rational allocation of the cash consideration offered to the underlying transaction that results in progress by bj s toward earning the rebates and allowances  provided the amounts to be earned are probable and reasonably estimable 
otherwise  rebates and allowances are recognized only when predetermined milestones are met 
we review the status of all rebates and allowances at least once per quarter and update our estimates  if necessary  at that time 
we believe that our review process has allowed us to avoid material adjustments in estimates of vendor rebates and allowances 
legal contingencies as described in more detail in note f to the consolidated financial statements  bj s is subject to various claims relating to fraudulent credit and debit card charges  the cost of replacing cards and related monitoring expenses and other related claims 
as required by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies  sfas no 
we accrue a liability if the potential loss for a claim is considered probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether our exposure can be reasonably estimated 
in reviewing the reserve relating to the credit card claims  we make significant estimates regarding the claims that have been made for fraudulent credit and debit card charges and the cost of replacing cards  monitoring expenses  and related fees and expenses 
because of uncertainties related to this matter  accruals are based on information available at the time our financial statements are issued 
periodically  and as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability and may revise our estimates and adjust our reserve 
inventories merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost  determined under the average cost method  or market 
we recognize the write down of slow moving or obsolete inventory in cost of sales when such write downs are probable and estimable 
records are maintained at the stockkeeping unit sku level 
a report that details the number of weeks of selling supply for each sku allows our merchandising staff to make timely markdown decisions to help maintain rapid inventory turnover  which is essential in our business 
the carrying value of any sku whose selling price is marked down to below cost is immediately reduced to that selling price 
we take physical inventories of merchandise on a cycle basis at every location each year 
a second physical inventory is taken at the end of the year at selected locations 
we estimate a reserve for inventory shrinkage for the period between physical inventories 
this estimate is based on historical results of previous physical inventories  shrinkage trends or other judgments management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
long lived assets we review the realizability of our long lived assets annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
current and expected operating results and cash flows and other factors are considered in connection with our reviews 
significant judgments are made in projecting future cash flows and are based on a number of factors  including the maturity level of the club  historical experience of clubs with similar characteristics  recent trends and general economic assumptions 
impairment losses are measured as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the impaired assets 
income tax reserves we pay income taxes to federal  state and municipal taxing authorities 
we are subject to audit by these jurisdictions and maintain reserves for those uncertain tax positions which we believe may be subject to challenge 
our reserves are based on our estimate of the likely outcome of these audits  and are revised periodically based on changes in tax law and court cases involving taxpayers with similar circumstances 
reserves for closed store lease obligations during the fiscal year ended february   we established reserves for our liability related to househome  inc househome leases 
pursuant to an agreement with the tjx companies  inc tjx  we agreed to indemnify tjx for of househome s lease liabilities guaranteed by tjx through january  and for of any such liabilities thereafter 
househome filed for bankruptcy in november see note c of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
as of january   all househome leases for which we were contingently liable had been settled  including lump sum settlements for leases 
the other three househome properties for which we remain contingently liable have been assigned to third parties 
during the fiscal year ended february   we established reserves for our lease liabilities for three bj s clubs which were closed in november two of these clubs were in the columbus  ohio  market and one was in north dade  florida 
see note c of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
our recorded liabilities have been based on the present value of rent liabilities under these leases  including estimated real estate taxes and common area maintenance charges  reduced by estimated income from the subleasing of these properties 
an annual discount rate of was used to calculate the present value of these lease obligations 
this rate was based on the estimated incremental borrowing rate for the company during the weighted average period of time over which these obligations are expected to be paid 
a considerable amount of judgment was involved in determining our net liability related to the closed store leases  particularly in estimating potential sublease income 
based on our knowledge of real estate conditions in the local markets and our experience in those markets  we assume an average period of time it would take to sublease the properties and the amount of potential sublease income for each property 
we reassess our liability for closed club leases at least every quarter and adjust our reserves accordingly when our estimates change 
we have made lump sum payments to settle the leases for two of the three closed clubs  including one settlement in the reserve at january  is based on the present value of our rent liability under the lease for the remaining club  including real estate taxes and common area maintenance charges  reduced by estimated income from subleasing the property 
we will continue to use an annual discount rate of to calculate the present value of the obligation 
self insurance reserves we are primarily self insured for worker s compensation and general liability claims 
reported reserves for these claims are derived from estimated ultimate costs based upon individual claim file reserves and estimates for incurred but not reported claims 
estimates are based on valuations provided by third party actuaries  historical loss development factors  and other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances

in october  we began testing a concept that is new to bj s by opening the first of two new clubs in the metro new york market exclusively for food service businesses under the name profoods restaurant supply 
our second profoods club was opened in january the business model for profoods is built on somewhat higher merchandise margins than those generated by a wholesale club  free memberships and a broad merchandise assortment to support one stop shopping  primarily on a cash and carry basis 
we still consider profoods as a new venture that will take time to develop 
in its first full year of operation  the business did not perform fully to our expectations

planned capital expenditures in include approximately to million for the completion of our new cross dock facility in uxbridge  massachusetts  which we plan to open in the summer 
the timing of actual openings and the amount of related expenditures could vary from the estimates above due  among other things  to the complexity of the real estate development process

as of january   our remaining repurchase authorization was million 
in january  we assumed a real estate mortgage with a principal balance of  in connection with the purchase of a club that was previously leased 
this debt carries an interest rate of  is payable in monthly installments maturing through november  and has a prepayment penalty 
the principal balance at january  was million 
on april   we entered into a new million unsecured credit agreement with a group of banks which expires april  the new agreement includes a million sub facility for letters of credit  of which million was outstanding at january  we are required to pay an annual facility fee which is currently of the total commitment 
interest on borrowings is payable at bj s option either at a the eurodollar rate plus a margin which is currently or b a rate equal to the higher of i the sum of the federal funds effective rate plus or ii the agent bank s prime rate 
we are also required to pay a usage fee whenever the amount of loans and undrawn or unreimbursed letters of credit outstanding exceeds of the total commitment 
the usage fee  if applicable  would be at an annual rate of of the amount borrowed 
the facility fee and eurodollar margin are subject to change based upon our fixed charge coverage ratio 
the agreement contains financial covenants which include a minimum fixed charge coverage requirement and a maximum adjusted debt to capital limitation 
we are required to comply with these covenants on a quarterly basis 
under the credit agreement  we may pay dividends or repurchase our own stock in any amount so long as we remain in compliance with all requirements under the agreement 
we have no credit rating triggers that would accelerate the maturity date of debt if borrowings were outstanding under our credit agreement 
we were in compliance with the covenants and other requirements set forth in our credit agreement at january  in addition to the credit agreement  we maintain a separate million facility for letters of credit  primarily to support the purchase of inventories  of which million was outstanding at january   and we also maintain a million uncommitted credit line for short term borrowings which expires on september  as of january   we also had a standalone letter of credit in the amount of million outstanding at year end  which is used to support our self insurance program for workers compensation 
there were no borrowings outstanding under our bank credit agreement or our uncommitted credit line at january  and january  increases in inventories and accounts payable from january  to january  were due mainly to the addition of new clubs and an increase of in the average inventory per club in the same time period 
pursuant to an agreement with tjx and in connection with househome s filing for bankruptcy on november   we recorded a pretax charge of million in for our estimated loss associated with househome leases 
based on our continuing evaluation of our remaining obligations and the significant progress made in settling liabilities for househome leases  we recorded pretax gains of million in  million in  million in and million in to reduce our estimated liability related to househome contingent lease obligations 
as of january   we have settled all househome leases for which we were originally contingently liable  including lump sum settlements for leases 
the other three househome properties for which we remain contingently liable have been assigned to third parties 
during the third quarter of  we established reserves for our liability related to leases for three bj s clubs which closed on november  see note c of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
our recorded liabilities were based on the present value of rent liabilities under the three leases  including estimated real estate taxes and common area maintenance charges  reduced by estimated income from the subleasing of these properties 
an annual discount rate of was used to calculate the present value of these lease obligations 
this rate was based on estimated borrowing rates for the company that took into consideration the weighted average period of time over which these obligations are expected to be paid 
during  we made a lump sum payment to settle the lease for one of the three closed clubs 
based on this settlement and an evaluation of the status of the two remaining properties  we recorded a pretax charge of million in to increase our reserve for closed clubs 
in  we made a lump sum payment to settle the lease of a second closed club 
the settlement was consistent with the amount which we had reserved for this club 
the reserve at january  is based on the present value of our rent liability under the lease for the other remaining club  including real estate taxes and common area maintenance charges  reduced by estimated future income from subleasing the property 
we will continue to use an annual discount rate of to calculate the present value of the obligation 
we believe that the liabilities recorded in the financial statements adequately provide for these lease obligations 
however  there can be no assurance that our actual liability for closed store obligations will not differ materially from amounts recorded in the financial statements due to a number of factors  including future economic factors which may affect the ability to successfully sublease  assign or otherwise settle liabilities related to these properties 
we consider our maximum reasonably possible undiscounted pretax exposure for our closed store lease obligations to be approximately million at january  bj s has filed proofs of claim against househome  inc for claims arising under certain agreements between bj s and househome in connection with the company s spin off from waban inc in july these claims arise primarily from bj s indemnification of tjx with respect to tjx s guarantee of househome leases and from the tax sharing agreement dated july  between bj s and househome 
househome and bj s have settled bj s claims against househome 
the settlement provides that bj s will have an unsecured claim of approximately million  on account of claims under the tax sharing agreement and indemnification payments which have been made to tjx 
the settlement agreement was approved by the united states bankruptcy court for the central district of california on november  as part of the settlement  bj s has been released of all claims that househome and its bankruptcy estate may have had against bj s  including million owed by bj s to househome under the tax sharing agreement 
we recognized this amount as a reduction in our tax provision in the fourth quarter of during  we received pretax recoveries on account of our househome bankruptcy claims of million 
these recoveries are recorded in gain on contingent lease obligations in the statements of income 
on a post tax basis  these gains totaled million 
during  we received pretax recoveries on account of our househome bankruptcy claims totaling million  including a payment of million to settle our claim against the indenture trustee for househome s convertible subordinated notes 
we have no further claims against the indenture trustee 
these recoveries are also included in gain on contingent lease obligations in the statements of income 
on a post tax basis these gains totaled million 
in march  we received bankruptcy recoveries of million on account of our househome bankruptcy claims 
on a post tax basis  these gains were million 
the bankruptcy court has closed our case  and we do not expect to receive further payments on our claims 
the recoveries that we received in march will be recorded in the first quarter of the fiscal year ending february  early in we were notified by credit card issuers that credit and debit card accounts used legitimately at bj s were subsequently used in fraudulent transactions at non bj s locations 
in response  we retained a leading computer security firm to conduct a forensic analysis of our information technology systems with a goal of determining whether a breach had in fact occurred 
while no conclusive evidence of a breach was found  the computer security firm concluded that our centralized computer system that serves as the aggregation point for all bj s credit and debit card transactions chain wide had not been breached and any breach would have likely occurred in a more decentralized fashion involving club level systems 
on march   after our receipt of the computer security firm s preliminary report of findings  we issued a public statement alerting consumers to the potential security breach 
in  we recorded pretax charges of million million post tax to establish a reserve for claims seeking reimbursement for fraudulent credit and debit card charges and the cost of replacing cards  monitoring expenses and related fees and expenses 
in  we recorded additional charges of million million post tax to increase our reserve 
these charges were driven primarily by an increase in our estimate of legal costs to be incurred in connection with this matter 
as of january   the balance in the reserve was million  which represented our best estimate of the remaining cost and expenses related to this matter at that time 
this reserve is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our balance sheet 
in connection with this matter  on september  the company entered into a consent decree with the federal trade commission ftc  which has jurisdiction over consumer protection matters 
the full text of the consent decree can be found on the ftc s website 
in summary  bj s has not admitted any wrongdoing or that the facts alleged in the ftc s complaint are true 
under the consent decree  bj s will pay no fines or damages 
bj s has agreed  however  to maintain a comprehensive information security program  much of which was put in place shortly after bj s first learned of the possible compromise  and to a biannual assessment of that program by an independent third party 
as of march   the amount of outstanding claims  which are primarily from credit card issuing banks  was approximately million 
we are unable to predict whether further claims will be asserted 
we have contested and will continue to vigorously contest the claims made against us and continue to explore our defenses and possible claims against others 
the ultimate outcome of this matter could differ from the amounts recorded 
while that difference could be material to the results of operations for any affected reporting period  it is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or liquidity 
bj s had no off balance sheet arrangements at any time during the fiscal year ended january  the following summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of january  and the effect these obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years dollars in thousands long term debt operating leases purchase obligations closed store lease obligations other long term liabilities in the table above  long term debt consists of a real estate mortgage which matures through november  amounts for long term debt include interest as well as principal

the timing of asset retirement obligation payments corresponds to the end of the estimated useful life assigned to the assets 
not included in other noncurrent liabilities in the table above were payments of million for our rent escalation liabilities because they are already included in the operating leases line  and deferred revenue of million  which is not a cash obligation

however  we may from time to time seek to obtain additional financing
