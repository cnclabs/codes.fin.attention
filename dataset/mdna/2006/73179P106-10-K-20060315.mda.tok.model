item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations purpose of management s discussion and analysis md a the purpose of the following discussion is to provide relevant information to investors who use our financial statements so they can assess our financial condition and results of operations by evaluating the amounts and certainty of cash flows from our operations and from outside sources 
the three principal objectives of md a are to provide a narrative explanation of financial statements that enables investors to see our company through the eyes of management  to enhance overall financial disclosure and provide the context within which financial information should be analyzed  and to provide information about the quality and potential variability of earnings and cash flows so that investors can judge the likelihood that that past performance is indicative of future performance 
business overview we are a leading global compounding and north american distribution company with operations in thermoplastic compounds  specialty vinyl resins  specialty polymer formulations  color and additive systems  and thermoplastic resin distribution with equity investments in manufacturers of pvc resin and its intermediates 
headquartered in avon lake  ohio  with sales of billion  we have manufacturing sites and warehouses in north america  europe and asia  and joint ventures in north america and colombia 
we employ approximately  people  and sell more than  different specialty and commodity products to over  customers in countries 
we provide value to our customers through our ability to link our knowledge of polymers and formulation technology with our manufacturing and supply chain to provide an essential link between large chemical producers our raw material suppliers and designers  assemblers and processors of plastics our customers 
recent developments sale of businesses and discontinued operations as of december   our engineered films and specialty resins businesses qualified for discontinued operations accounting treatment 
in september  we announced that we had signed a letter of intent to sell our engineered films business 
on february   we sold of the engineered films business to an investor group consisting of members of the business management team and matrix films  llc for gross proceeds of million before associated fees and costs 
a cash payment of million was received on the closing date and the remaining million was in the form of a five year note from the buyer 
we do not expect to recognize any further gain or loss in from the transaction 
we retained an ownership interest in the company 
all historical financial information for the engineered films business has been accounted for as a discontinued operation 
in december  we announced that the specialty resins divestment process was unlikely to result in a sale of the business at acceptable terms 
as a result  its financial results have been reclassified from discontinued operations to continuing operations for all periods as of december  it is now included in the performance plastics segment  where it had been previously 
unless otherwise noted  disclosures contained in this report relate to continuing operations 
for more information about our discontinued operations see note b to the consolidated financial statements 
purchase of businesses in january  we completed the purchase of the remaining of equity ownership in star color  a color additives manufacturing subsidiary in thailand  for million 
this business is included in the performance plastics segment 
in may  we purchased equipment  compounding recipes and a customer list from novatec plastics corporation  a compounding business owned by pvc container corporation  for million 
these assets are included in the performance plastics segment and are used to serve our customers in the custom profile and custom molding markets 
executive management changes in october  thomas a 
waltermire resigned as our president and chief executive officer and as a director 
william f 
patient  non executive chairman of the board  served as interim chief executive officer until a permanent successor was named 
in january  v 
lance mitchell  group vice president and general manager of color and engineered materials  resigned to accept a position with another company 
robert bindner  director of sales for color and additives  is filling this position until a permanent successor is selected 
mr

in february  stephen d 
newlin joined the company as chairman  president and chief executive officer 
he was president of the industrial sector of ecolab  inc from to  and prior to that was president and a director with nalco chemical company from to and served as chief operating officer and vice chairman from to restructuring initiatives and facility closures in november  we announced that we would close our manchester  england plastic color additives facility to reduce costs and align capacity with market demand 
production is being phased polyone corporation 
table of contents out while business with key customers is either being transitioned to other polyone facilities or customers secure alternative sources for products 
the facility had employees 
a charge to operating income of million was made in the fourth quarter of  and we estimate that an additional charge of million will be recognized in the first quarter of to complete the plant phaseout 
we expect that the process will be completed by the end of the first quarter of outlook business demand was strong at the end of  particularly following the disruptive events associated with the two hurricanes that negatively affected operations and raw material availability on the us gulf coast 
it appears that early global business demand is higher than in early this strength appears in all three regions where we operate north america  europe and asia 
adding to the optimism in north america is the expectation that energy costs should decline in compared with  which should benefit us in terms of lower operating and raw material costs 
while projections show north american interest rates rising in  housing construction and remodeling activity is expected to decline only moderately from levels 
some of this demand in early should result from rebuilding areas damaged by the hurricanes 
building materials represent approximately of our annual sales 
north american automobile and light truck build rates slowed significantly in late  particularly among the big three domestic manufacturers 
early build rates are expected to lag behind rates  particularly for the big three  which depend on truck and suv sales that are slowing due to higher gasoline prices 
automotive applications represent approximately of our annual sales 
forecasts show us industrial production increasing to 
our view is that real plastics growth in north america will be up by to in compared with in late  europe continued to experience slow growth  which characterized business conditions there throughout entering  however  there are signs that business conditions may be improving  especially in germany and france  our two largest european markets 
our view is that overall industrial demand  and plastics demand in particular  will be up slightly  by approximately in compared with asian business slowed slightly in late  but expectations remain for a robust adding to our optimism is the building momentum in orders for our new manufacturing facility in south china 
this plant is expected to capture the increasing growth in the region 
for asia  projections show plastics market growth of to in growth in china is expected to continue at a to annual pace 
oil and natural gas derived hydrocarbon feedstock pricing  which spiked in late due to hurricane related outages  is expected to decrease in as a result  price trends for key raw materials should be flat or slightly down compared with throughout  however  chlorine and caustic soda prices should remain near the levels achieved at the end of  as industry production utilization levels remain very high 
this situation bodes particularly well for sunbelt  which had record earnings in oxyvinyls should have another solid year  with polyvinyl chloride resin manufacturing utilization levels remaining near capacity 
moderating ethylene and natural gas costs should also help to improve results 
these trends should benefit the resin and intermediates segment  which is expected to generate earnings close to the record levels it achieved during one of our main objectives in the second half of was to increase spreads selling price less raw material costs for products within the performance plastics segment 
we believe that we entered with these spreads at higher levels than they were at the start of in particular  our vinyl compounds and engineered materials product groups  as well as our distribution segment  achieved significant price increases during the fourth quarter of maintaining and even expanding these spreads is key to improving the operating earnings of the performance plastics segment in we also will focus on continuing to strengthen our market positions in we have specific growth targets and have charged our managers with gaining market share 
in addition  we are implementing specific plans to bring three product groups  north american color  north american engineered materials and the newly formed producer services  to a combined level of profitability in we expect to achieve this through a combination of shipment volume growth  product line upgrades to more specialty materials  manufacturing cost reductions and productivity enhancements 
since our formation  in the aggregate  these product groups have not been profitable 
we are also committed to maintaining control of overhead costs 
we expect to keep selling and administrative costs as a percentage of sales to or less 
in addition  we are focused on holding the growth in working capital to less than the rate of sales growth 
we expect these additional factors to affect cash flow capital expenditures should be million to million compared with spending of million  due largely to higher spending in support of growth initiatives  depreciation and amortization should be approximately million including specialty resins  which is now included in continuing operations  cash distributions from equity affiliates should approximate levels  provided that there is no material change in the operating conditions of our equity affiliates  polyone corporation 
table of contents we received a cash payment of million in february upon the sale of the engineered films business  we anticipate receiving proceeds of approximately million to million from various legal matters including insurance coverage and antitrust claims  which were settled in our favor in the fourth quarter of and first quarter of  we anticipate receiving gross proceeds of approximately million to million from the sale of previously closed facilities and redundant assets in  restructuring expenditures should be minimal  cash income taxes foreign and state should be similar to  at million to million  no contributions to our qualified us pension plan will be required in less than million is due on debt maturing in  and interest expense should be approximately million to million lower in compared with as a result of debt reductions 
results of operations summary of consolidated results income from continuing operations improved by million  or per share 
sales increased by from last year  however  our sales growth was driven in part by higher raw material  distribution and energy costs that we were able to partially recapture with selling price increases 
our sales volume declined by in our performance plastics segment and by in our distribution segment 
the majority of our customers experienced softer demand in their end markets  which affected their demand for our products 
the domestic and international business environment remained very competitive 
the negative impact of the year over year volume decline  however  was offset by a million reduction in selling and administrative costs and million less in interest expense 
lower interest expense was the result of strong cash generated from operating activities  which allowed us to reduce debt by million in also  for the second year in a row  we funded working capital needs resulting from increased sales by improving our management of accounts receivable  inventories and accounts payable 
though higher sales levels would have otherwise consumed million in additional cash to fund these working capital needs  improved collection periods and inventory turns allowed us to generate million in cash in  offsetting the effect of higher sales on working capital 
strong earnings from our equity affiliate and minority interest investments in  up million due to improved profitability from our resins and intermediates segment  helped to offset the impact of the volume decline on pre tax earnings 
oxyvinyls benefited from higher industry wide margins on pvc resin and vinyl chloride monomer that resulted from favorable supply and demand dynamics combined with improved chlor alkali profitability 
results in the third quarter  however  were tempered by hurricane related production interruptions and a million non cash impairment charge that was related to a previously idled chlor alkali facility 
sunbelt s earnings improvement was largely due to higher selling prices for chlorine and caustic soda  again driven by favorable supply and demand dynamics 
our primary objectives in are to grow sales volume through organic business growth  maintain or restore product spreads  continue to contain selling and administrative costs  continue to drive working capital improvements to fund sales growth with a minimum investment  and generate strong cash flow from operating activities to improve our financial flexibility by reducing debt  increasing liquidity and strengthening our balance sheet

income tax expense is primarily related to foreign earnings and state income taxes 
in  we recorded tax expense on domestic income at a rate lower than the federal statutory rate because we reversed a portion of our tax asset valuation allowance 
in and  we did not record a tax benefit on domestic losses due to uncertainty about whether we will fully realize the net deferred tax assets that were generated by domestic losses 
we intend to maintain a valuation allowance until positive evidence exists that it is more likely than not that these assets will be realized

vinyl compounds north american colors and additives north american engineered materials international colors and engineered materials polymer coating systems specialty resins total performance plastics vinyl compounds volume was down due to softer demand in virtually all markets except custom extrusions and fittings 
the majority of our customers experienced softer market conditions  which negatively affected their demand for our products 
this decline in volume was partially offset by new business obtained in custom extrusion and wire cable applications 
higher average selling prices from efforts to recapture increases in the cost of resin and non resin raw materials was the primary driver of the sales increase 
north american colors and additives volume improved from new business that we obtained in construction material applications and for contract tolling compounding using customer supplied materials  partially offset by reduced demand in packaging  pipe fittings and film market platforms 
this net volume gain  combined with a favorable shift in product mix within our contract tolling business  helped to increase sales 
the sales increase was also the result of higher average selling prices from our efforts to recapture raw material cost increases as well as the nature of some of our business where selling prices are more closely tied to raw material indices 
north american engineered materials volume declined primarily from lower demand for certain general purpose and contract manufactured automotive applications because these customers used less of these materials in the same applications  combined with a general slowing in automotive production levels that began early in the second half of the year 
higher average selling prices from efforts to recapture raw material cost increases  combined with a shift in product mix toward higher priced products used in specific automotive applications  helped to hold sales level with the prior year 
international colors and engineered materials volume declined 
the may sale of the melos rubber granules business accounted for percentage points of the year over year volume decline 
the balance of the volume decline was primarily the result of weakness in demand for certain engineered materials applications and a general weakness in european plastics markets that was partially offset by higher volume in asia  strengthened by our new manufacturing facility in shenzhen  china that began operations in the second quarter of this plant manufactures engineered material compounds  color compounds and plastisol inks 
higher average selling prices from efforts to recapture raw material cost increases  combined with favorable euro to us dollar currency exchange rates totaling approximately million  contributed to a sales increase of 
the sale of the melos rubber granules business negatively affected the year over year revenue comparison by percentage points 
polymer coating systems volume declined primarily due to a decline in automotive demand caused mainly by reduced production schedules and platform build outs 
some customers with their own compounding capability also decided to bring some of their plastisol requirements in house to utilize their internal capacity more fully  which reduced our volume 
higher average selling prices from efforts to recapture raw material cost increases drove the sales increase 
polyone corporation 
table of contents specialty resins volume fell in the second half primarily as the result of slower overall market conditions combined with increased competition from lower priced imported resin 
higher average selling prices resulting from efforts to restore product spreads by recapturing raw material cost increases were the main drivers of the sales increase 
performance plastics operating income  as a percentage of sales  declined by percentage points 
the main drivers were lower volumes  increased raw material costs and increased energy costs across virtually all product lines 
selling price increases only partially offset the impact of higher costs 
ongoing manufacturing  selling and administrative expense reduction efforts helped to partially offset the negative impact of rising raw material costs 
expenses affecting the comparability of earnings for employee separation and plant phaseout  environmental remediation costs at inactive sites  asset impairments and loss on the sale of assets were million in and million in the distribution volume decline was primarily in commodity resins  consistent with the general softening across the north american plastics industry during the second quarter experienced by our performance plastics segment 
selling price increases that were passed through from our supplier base and a shift in product mix toward higher priced products drove the sales increase 
distribution operating income as a percentage of sales remained level with the prior year 
the effect of lower volumes and material cost increases were offset by higher selling prices 
operating costs were consistent with the prior year 
resin and intermediates operating income increased million  the result of a million increase in sunbelt s equity earnings contribution  partially offset by a million decline in oxyvinyls equity earnings contribution  which included a million non cash impairment charge in that was related to a previously idled chlor alkali facility at oxyvinyls 
oxyvinyls benefited from higher industry average pvc resin and vcm product spreads that resulted from favorable supply demand dynamics and improved chlor alkali profitability as compared to last year 
this benefit was tempered in the third quarter by the adverse impact of the combination of hurricane related production interruptions and significant increases in ethylene and natural gas costs 
sunbelt s earnings improvement was largely from significantly higher combined selling prices for chlorine and caustic soda that was driven by favorable supply and demand dynamics

vinyl compounds north american colors and additives north american engineered materials international colors and engineered materials polymer coating systems specialty resins total performance plastics vinyl compounds volume was up due to stronger demand in the wire and cable  construction and telecommunications markets 
higher average selling prices  resulting from efforts to offset raw material cost increases  combined with higher volume  drove the sales increase 
north american colors and additives volume was up from stronger demand in extrusion profile applications  higher contract compounding volume and a new application for outdoor decking 
lower selling prices for contract compounding  where raw materials are supplied by the customer  combined with lower average selling prices in the extrusion profile market  resulted in a sales increase that was less than the volume increase 
north american engineered materials volume was down as a result of softer demand in toll compounding applications for the automotive market 
sales increased due to a higher priced mix of proprietary and customer tolled products for automotive and telecommunication applications combined with efforts to offset raw material cost increases in our selling prices 
international colors and engineered materials total volume declined 
the may sale of the melos rubber granules business  however  negatively impacted the year over year volume comparison by percentage points 
therefore  excluding melos  volume increased reflecting stronger demand in both asia and europe 
higher average selling prices from efforts to offset raw material cost increases and favorable euro to us dollar currency exchange rates totaling approximately million contributed to the sales increase 
the sale of the melos rubber granules business negatively affected the year over year sales comparison by percentage points 
polymer coating systems volume was down primarily from lower plastisol and powder volumes for automotive applications on models that have been phased out 
this decline was partially offset by higher volumes in inks 
sales increased from the resulting change in product mix  combined with higher average selling prices resulting from efforts to offset raw material cost increases 
specialty resins volume increased from stronger customer end market demand and a production capacity constraint in the market that resulted from the shutdown of a competitor s production facility 
the primary drivers of the sales increase were the volume improvement and higher selling prices that partially offset significant increases in the cost of vinyl chloride monomer  the primary raw material used in the production of resin 
performance plastics operating income  as a percentage of sales  improved by percentage points 
the main drivers were higher volumes combined with lower costs that resulted from manufacturing  selling and administrative restructuring and cost reduction initiatives 
favorable currency translation also added approximately million to earnings 
raw material cost increases  however  generally outpaced our ability to raise prices during expenses affecting the comparability of earnings for employee separation and plant phaseout  asset impairments and loss on the sale of assets were million in and million in distribution volume increased as the result of stronger demand for polyone produced products  third party commodity resins and the january acquisition of the north american business of resindirect  a subsidiary of louis dreyfus energy services 
these increases were partially offset by volume declines in mexico that resulted from exiting a portion of the business during the first half of and subsequently exporting from the united states 
the sales increase outpaced the volume increase due to selling price increases from our supplier base that we passed through to our customers 
distribution operating income as a percentage of sales improved by percentage points 
the main drivers were increased volumes in the united states and canada  combined with cost savings resulting from restructuring initiatives and closing the mexican distribution operation in operating income in also included a million charge for employee separation and plant phaseout costs 
resin and intermediates operating income increased million as the result of a million increase in oxyvinyls earnings contribution and a million increase in sunbelt s earnings contribution 
results in also included a million charge for restructuring costs and the cumulative effect of an accounting change at oxyvinyls 
oxyvinyls earnings improved due to favorable supply and demand dynamics that drove improved operating margins for pvc and vcm 
sunbelt s earnings were up from increased volume and higher margins on chlorine and caustic soda sales 
other consists primarily of corporate general and administrative costs that were not allocated to business segments and inter segment sales and profit eliminations

impact of inflation although inflation has slowed in recent years  we believe it is still a factor in our economy  and we continually seek ways to mitigate its impact 
to the extent permitted by competition  we pass on increased costs to our customers by increasing sales prices over time 
the primary raw material in our performance plastics segment is pvc resin 
the price of pvc resin fluctuates in tandem with the cost of raw materials primarily ethylene and chlorine and natural gas that are used in the manufacture of pvc resin  as well as supply and demand 
as a result  our selling prices can also decline in periods of declining pvc resin costs 
our sales growth in and is due in part to selling price increases that partially recaptured higher raw material  distribution and energy costs 
we use the last in  first out lifo method of accounting for of our inventories and the first in  first out fifo or average cost method for the remainder 
under the lifo method  the cost of products sold that are reported in the financial statements approximates current costs  providing a better match of current period revenue and expenses 
charges to operations for depreciation represent the allocation of historical costs incurred over past years and are lower than if they were based on the current cost of the productive capacity being consumed 
accounting policies and estimates significant accounting policies are described more fully in note c to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the related facts and circumstances 
the application of these critical accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions for future uncertainties 
accordingly  actual results could differ significantly from these estimates 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require our most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
sales discounts and rebates sales discounts and rebates are offered to certain customers to promote customer loyalty and to encourage greater product sales 
these programs provide customers with credits against their purchases if they attain pre established volumes or revenue milestones for a specific period 
we estimate the provision for rebates based upon the specific terms of each agreement at the time of shipment and an estimate of the customer s future achievement of the respective volume or revenue milestones 
the actual amounts earned can differ from these estimates 
in the past  the actual amounts earned by our customers have not differed materially from our estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts allowances for doubtful accounts are determined based upon estimates of losses related to customer receivable balances 
in establishing the appropriate provisions for customer receivable balances  we make assumptions about their future collectibility 
our assumptions are based on an individual assessment of each customer s credit quality as well as subjective factors and trends  including the aging of receivable balances 
we regularly analyze significant customer accounts and record a specific reserve to reduce the related receivable to the amount we reasonably believe is collectible when we become aware of a customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  such as in the case of a bankruptcy filing or deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position 
we also record reserves for all other customers based on a variety of factors  including the length of time the receivables are past due  the financial health of the customer  economic conditions and our historical experience 
if circumstances related to specific customers change  our estimates of the collectibility of receivables may be adjusted further 
in the past  the actual losses incurred have differed from our estimates primarily as a result of unforeseen bankruptcy filings by our customers 
environmental accrued liability based upon estimates prepared by our environmental engineers and consultants  we have million accrued at december  to cover probable future environmental remediation expenditures 
we do not believe that any of these matters  either individually or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures  consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flow beyond the amount accrued 
this accrual represents our best estimate of the remaining probable remediation costs based upon information and technology currently available and our view of the most likely remedy 
depending upon the results of future testing  the ultimate remediation alternatives undertaken  changes in regulations  new information  newly discovered conditions and other factors  it is reasonably possible that we could incur additional costs in excess of the amount accrued 
however  such additional costs  if any  cannot currently be estimated 
our estimate of this liability polyone corporation 
table of contents may be revised as new regulations or technologies are developed or additional information is obtained 
changes during the past five years have primarily resulted from an increase in the estimate of future remediation costs at existing sites during and payments made each year for remediation costs that were already accrued 
for more information about our environmental liabilities  see note n to the consolidated financial statements 
asbestos related claims we have been named in various lawsuits involving multiple claimants and defendants for alleged asbestos exposure in the past by  among others  workers and contractors and their families at plants owned by us or our predecessors  or on board ships owned or operated by us or our predecessors 
we have reserves totaling million as of december  for asbestos related claims that are probable and estimable 
we believe that the probability is remote that losses in excess of the amounts we have accrued could be materially adverse to our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
this belief is based upon our ongoing assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of the specific claims and our defenses and insurance coverage available for these claims  as well as the probability and expected magnitude of reasonably anticipated future asbestos related claims 
our assessment includes whether the pleadings allege exposure to asbestos  asbestos containing products or premises exposure  the severity of the plaintiffs alleged injuries from exposure to asbestos or asbestos containing products and the length and certainty of exposure on our premises  to the extent disclosed in the pleadings or identified through discovery  whether the named defendant related to us manufactured or sold asbestos containing products  the outcomes of cases recently resolved  and the historical pattern of the number of claims 
if the underlying facts and circumstances change in the future  we will modify our reserves  as appropriate 
this accrual has not materially changed over the past several years 
restructuring related accruals since polyone was formed in  we have recorded accruals for charges in connection with restructuring our businesses  as well as integrating acquired businesses 
these accruals include estimates related to employee separation costs  the closure and or consolidation of facilities  contractual obligations and valuing assets such as property  plant and equipment  and inventories 
actual amounts could differ from the original estimates  and have differed in the past primarily from differences between estimated and actual net proceeds received upon the sale of property  plant and equipment 
restructuring related accruals are reviewed on a quarterly basis and changes to plans are appropriately recognized when identified 
changes to restructuring plans for existing businesses are recorded as employee separation and plant phaseout costs in the period when the change occurs 
for more information about our restructuring activities  see note e to the consolidated financial statements 
goodwill under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we are required to perform impairment tests of our goodwill and intangible assets 
these tests must be done at least once a year  and more frequently if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment or a decline in value may have occurred 
we test for goodwill impairment on july of each year 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process  which requires us to make judgments about what assumptions to use in the calculation 
the first step of the process consists of estimating the fair value of each reporting unit based on a number of factors  including projected future operating results and business plans  economic projections  anticipated future cash flows  comparable marketplace data from within a consistent industry grouping  and the cost of capital 
we compare these estimated fair values with their carrying values  which includes the allocated goodwill 
if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment by determining an implied fair value of goodwill 
the determination of a reporting unit s implied fair value of goodwill requires us to allocate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
any unallocated fair value represents the implied fair value of goodwill  which is compared to its corresponding carrying value 
subsequent to the initial impairment test upon adoption of sfas no 
 we have not recorded an impairment to goodwill as a result of these tests 
we cannot predict what future events might adversely affect the reported value of our goodwill 
these events include  but are not limited to  strategic decisions made in response to economic competitive conditions  the impact of the economic environment on our customer base  or a material negative change in relationships with significant customers 
for more information about our goodwill  see note d to the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes estimates of full year taxable income used in the tax rate calculations for the legal entities and jurisdictions in which we operate change throughout the year 
during the year we use judgment to estimate our income for the year 
because judgment is involved  the tax rate may increase or decrease significantly in any period 
to determine income or loss for financial statement purposes  we make estimates and judgments 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in determining the recoverability of deferred tax assets that result from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  also requires us to reduce the deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods

table of contents in the process of determining our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  we consider all of the available positive and negative evidence  including our past operating results  the existence of cumulative losses in recent years and our forecast of future taxable income 
to estimate future taxable income we develop assumptions including the amount of future state  federal and international pre tax income  the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment to forecast future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our businesses 
as a result  we have computed a valuation allowance of million  and we intend to maintain it until it is more likely than not that the related deferred tax assets will be realized 
income tax expense that we record in the future will be reduced to the extent that there are offsetting decreases in the valuation allowance 
realizing our remaining deferred tax assets depends upon our ability to execute feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
any reduction in estimated future taxable income may require us to record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
an increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in the related period and could have a significant impact on future earnings 
in addition  the calculation of tax liabilities deals with uncertainties in applying complex tax regulations in a large number of jurisdictions 
we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based upon our estimate of the extent to which additional taxes may be due 
to the extent we prevail in matters for which accruals have been established  or are required to pay amounts in excess of recorded reserves  the effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted 
for more information about our income taxes  see note p to the consolidated financial statements 
pensions and post retirement benefits included in our results of operations are significant pension and post retirement benefit costs that we measure using actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions  including assumptions about discount rates and expected returns on plan assets 
these assumptions are updated at the beginning of each fiscal year 
we consider current market conditions  including changes in interest rates  in making these assumptions 
changes in pension and post retirement benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions 
to develop our discount rate  we consider the yields of high quality  fixed income investments with maturities that correspond to the timing of our benefit obligations 
to develop our expected return on plan assets  we consider our historical long term asset return experience  the expected investment portfolio mix of plan assets and an estimate of long term investment returns 
to develop our expected portfolio mix of plan assets  we consider the duration of the plan liabilities and give more weight to equity investments than to fixed income securities 
holding all other assumptions constant  a percentage point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have increased or decreased our net pension and post retirement expense by approximately million 
likewise  a percentage point increase or decrease in the expected return on plan assets would have increased or decreased our net pension cost by approximately million 
market conditions and interest rates significantly affect the future assets and liabilities of our pension and post retirement plans 
it is difficult to predict these factors due to the volatility of market conditions 
holding all other assumptions constant  a percentage point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have increased or decreased our minimum pension liability by approximately million as of december  the rate of increase in medical costs that we assume for the next five years was held constant with prior years to reflect both our actual experience and projected expectations 
the health care cost trend rate assumption has a significant effect on the amounts reported 
only certain employees hired prior to december  are eligible to participate in our subsidized post retirement plan 
for more information about our pensions and post retirement benefits  see note m to the consolidated financial statements 
contingencies we are subject to various investigations  claims  and legal and administrative proceedings covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of business activities 
any liability that may result from these proceedings that we judge to be probable and estimable has been accrued 
the actual amounts resulting from these matters can differ from our estimates

however  sfas no 
r requires that all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
we adopted statement r in the first quarter of  and currently estimate that the impact of adopting this standard will be an additional pre tax charge in of approximately million

cash flows detail about cash flows can be found in the consolidated statement of cash flows 
the following discussion focuses on the material components of cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities 
operating activities in  our operations provided million of cash 
primary sources of cash were profitable business operations  a decline in inventories from improved inventory turnover that resulted from better management of inventory levels at the end of the year compared to the end of the prior year  an increase in accounts payable due to higher purchasing levels to support higher sales levels at the end of the year compared to the prior year  cash distributions that we received from our equity investments  and short term borrowings under our receivables sale facility 
primary uses of cash were cash payments for environmental remediation at inactive sites  an increase in accounts receivable due to higher sales levels at the end of the year compared to the prior year  and the payment of employee bonuses that had been accrued at the end of that were greater than those that were accrued at the end of cash provided by discontinued operations was million 
in  our operations used million of cash 
primary sources of cash were profitable business operations  an increase in accounts payable due to a higher purchasing levels to support higher sales levels at the end of the year compared to the prior year  combined with longer payment terms  and cash distributions that we received from our equity investments 
primary uses of cash were cash payments for employee separation and plant closure initiatives  an increase in accounts receivable due to higher sales levels at the end of the year compared to the prior year  the repayment of short term borrowings under our receivables sale facility  and a million voluntary contribution to our defined benefit pension plans 
cash provided by discontinued operations was million 
in  our operations used million of cash 
primary sources of cash were cash distributions that we received from our equity investments and a decline in inventories from improved inventory turnover that resulted from better management of inventory levels at the end of the year compared to the end of the prior year 
primary uses of cash were a net loss in  cash payments for employee separation and plant closure initiatives  a decline in accounts payable due to the timing of payments at the end of the year compared to the end of the prior year  the repayment of short term borrowings under our receivables sale facility  and a decline in accrued pension costs 
cash provided by discontinued operations was million 
working capital management our working capital management efforts focus on three components of working capital that we believe are the most critical to maximizing cash provided by operating activities that we can manage on a day to day basis 
these components are accounts receivable  inventories and accounts payable 
to help us manage working capital  we use metrics that measure the number of days of sales in receivables dso  inventories dsi and accounts payable dsp 
this allows us to better understand the total dollar changes in these components of working capital by separating the changes due to efficiency days outstanding and the underlying volume of business sales and production levels 
polyone corporation 
table of contents the following table presents our working capital metrics and the impact of changes in efficiency and volume on accounts receivable  inventories and accounts payable accounts receivable dso inventories dsi accounts payable dsp net days at year end change in net days from prior year end cash provided used by in millions accounts receivable inventories accounts payable impact of change in days outstanding impact of change in sales and production levels higher sales levels during and used million of cash from operating activities to fund the increase in sales from to effective working capital reduction programs  however  resulted in a decline of net days outstanding over the same time period 
this contributed million to cash provided by operating activities  holding the increase in our total investment in receivables  inventory and payables from the effect of higher sales levels to a minimum since december  investing activities in  we used million for investing activities  reflecting capital spending in support of manufacturing operations  the purchase of the remaining of star color  a thailand based color and additives business  and the purchase of certain assets of novatec plastics corporation 
these two businesses are included in our performance plastics segment 
this was partially offset by proceeds that we received from the sale of previously closed facilities 
capital spending as a percentage of depreciation was in cash used by discontinued operations was million 
in  we generated million from investing activities  largely from the sale of our elastomers and performance additives business and our european melos rubber granules business 
melos was formerly included in our performance plastics segment 
elastomers and performance additives was a separate business segment 
this was partially offset by capital spending in support of manufacturing operations and the acquisition of the north american distribution business of resindirect llc  which is included in our distribution segment 
capital spending as a percentage of depreciation in was 
cash used by discontinued operations was million 
in  we used million from investing activities  driven by capital spending in support of manufacturing operations and the final payment due on our december acquisition of transformacion de pigmentos y colorantes  sa  which is included in our performance plastics segment 
this was partially offset by proceeds we received from the sale of our interest in techmer pm  llc  which was formerly included in our performance plastics segment 
cash used by discontinued operations was million 
financing activities cash used by financing activities in and was primarily to reduce debt 
cash provided by financing activities in was primarily from the issuance of million of unsecured notes  partially offset by the maturity of million of senior notes 
discontinued operations cash flows from discontinued operations are presented separately on a single line in each section of the consolidated statement of cash flows 
the absence of future cash flows from discontinued operations is not expected to materially affect future liquidity and capital resources 
we do expect  however  that retaining the specialty resins business that was previously reported as a discontinued operation will positively affect our future liquidity and capital resources 
balance sheets the following discussion focuses on material changes in balance sheet line items from december  to december  that are not discussed in the preceding cash flows section 
other current assets the increase was primarily due to recording a receivable for a fourth quarter legal settlement 
the funds were received in the first quarter of property  net the reduction was primarily due to the sale of redundant assets  a decline in currency exchange rates and capital spending that was less than depreciation expense 
post retirement benefits other than pensions the reduction was primarily due to the payment of other post employment benefits opebs that were in excess of the amount expensed and added to the accrual 
other non current liabilities including pensions the reduction was primarily due to cash payments for environmental remediation costs that were in excess of the amount expensed and added to the accrual 
capital resources and liquidity liquidity is defined as an enterprise s ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet both current and future needs 
these needs include paying obligations as they mature  maintaining production capacity and providing for planned growth

as of december   the fixed charge coverage ratio was to and availability under the facility was million

quantitative and qualitative information about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks as part of our ongoing business operations  including risks from changes in interest rates on debt obligations and foreign currency exchange rates that could impact our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we manage our exposure to these and other market risks through regular operating and financing activities  including the use of derivative financial instruments 
we intend to use these derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for speculative investment purposes 
interest rate exposure we periodically enter into interest rate swap agreements that modify our exposure to interest risk by converting our fixed rate obligations to floating rates 
on september   we terminated one of our seven existing interest rate swap agreements at a cash cost of million 
the six remaining agreements had a net fair value obligation of negative million and negative million at december  and  respectively 
the weighted average interest rate for these six agreements was at december  and at december  these exchange agreements are perfectly effective as defined by sfas no
