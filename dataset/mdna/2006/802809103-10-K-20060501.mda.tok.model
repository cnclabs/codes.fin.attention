table of contents item a 
risk factors the corporation is subject to risk in several areas 
discussed below  and elsewhere in this report  are the various risk factors that could cause the corporation s financial condition and results of operations to vary significantly from period to period 
please refer to the regulation and supervision section of this report for more information about legislative and regulatory risks 
also refer to the md a section  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  and the financial statements and supplementary data sections in this report for additional information about credit  interest rate and market risks 
any factor described below or elsewhere in this report or in our annual report to stockholders could  by itself or together with one or more other factors  have a material adverse effect on the corporation s financial condition and results of operations 
general business  economic and political conditions 
the corporation s businesses and earnings are affected by general economic and political conditions in puerto rico and the united states of america 
general business and economic conditions that could affect the corporation include short term and long term interest rates  inflation  monetary supply  fluctuations in both debt and equity capital markets  and the strength of the united states and puerto rico economies 
a period of reduced economic growth or a recession has historically resulted in a reduction in lending activity and an increase in the rate of defaults on loans 
a recession may have an adverse impact on net interest income and fee income 
the corporation may also experience significant losses on the loan portfolio due to defaults as customers become unable to meet their obligations  which would result in an adverse effect on earnings as higher reserves for loan losses would be required 
geopolitical conditions can also affect the corporation s earnings 
acts or threats of terrorism  actions taken by the united states or other governments in response to acts or threats of terrorism and or military conflicts  could affect the general business and economic conditions in puerto rico  united states and abroad 
the corporation s financial activities and credit exposure are concentrated in puerto rico 
as a result  the corporation s financial condition and results of operations are highly dependent on economic conditions in puerto rico 
an extended economic slowdown  adverse political or economic developments or natural disasters such as hurricanes  affecting puerto rico could result in a reduction in lending activities and an increase in the level of nonperforming assets and charge offs  all of which would adversely affect the corporation s profitability 
competition 
the corporation operates in a highly competitive environment in puerto rico from other united states  puerto rico and foreign banks as well as mortgage banking companies  insurance companies and brokers dealers 
increased competition could require that the corporation lower rates charged on loans or increase rates offered on deposits  which could adversely affect profitability 
the corporation s business model is based on a diversified mix of businesses that provide a broad range of financial products and services  delivered through multiple distribution channels 
the corporation s success depends  in part  on its ability to adapt its products and services to evolving industry standards 
there is increasing pressure to provide products and services at lower prices 
this can reduce the corporation s net interest margin and income from fee based products and services 
in addition  the widespread adoption of new technologies  including internet services  could require the corporation to incur in substantial expenditures to modify or adapt its existing products and services in order to remain competitive 
the corporation is at risk of not being successful or timely in introducing new products and services  responding or adapting to changes in consumer spending and saving habits  achieving market acceptance of its products and services  or developing and maintaining loyal customers 
interest rate risk 
net interest income is the interest earned on loans  securities and other assets minus the interest paid on deposits  long term and short term debt and other liabilities 
net interest income is the difference between the yield on assets and the rate paid on deposits and other sources of funding 
these rates are highly sensitive to many factors beyond the corporation s control  including general economic conditions and the policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies 
changes in monetary policy  including changes in interest rates  will influence the origination of loans  the prepayment speed of loans  the purchase of investments  the generation of deposits and the rates received on loans and investment securities and paid on deposits or other sources of funding 
the impact of these changes may be magnified if the corporation does not effectively manage the relative sensitivity of its assets and liabilities to changes in market interest rates 
changes in interest rates could adversely affect net interest margin 
although the yield earned on assets and funding costs tend to move in the same direction in response to changes in interest rates  one can rise or fall faster than the other  causing the corporation s net interest margin to expand or contract 
the corporation s liabilities tend to be shorter in duration than its assets  so they may adjust faster in response to changes in interest rates 

table of contents changes in the slope of the yield curve or the spread between short term and long term interest rates could also reduce the corporation s net interest margin 
normally  the yield curve is upward sloping  meaning short term rates are lower than long term rates 
however  since the corporation s liabilities tend to be shorter in duration than its assets  they may adjust faster in response to changes in interest rates 
as a result  when interest rates rise  funding costs may rise faster than the yield earned on assets  causing net interest margin to contract until the yield catches up 
the corporation assesses its interest rate risk by estimating the effect on earnings under various scenarios that differ based on assumptions about the direction  magnitude and speed of interest rate changes and the slope of the yield curve 
some interest rate risk is hedged with derivatives 
however  not all interest rate risk is hedged 
there is always the risk that changes in interest rates could reduce net interest income and earnings in material amounts  especially if actual conditions turn out to be materially different than what the corporation expected 
for example  if interest rates rise or fall faster than the corporation assumed  or the slope of the yield curve changes  the corporation may incur significant losses on debt securities held as investments 
to reduce interest rate risk  the corporation may rebalance its investment and loan portfolios  refinance its debt and take other strategic actions 
certain losses or expenses may be incurred when such strategic actions are taken 
refer to the risk management asset liability management section of the md a 
credit risk 
when the corporation lends money or commits to lend money or enters into a contract with a counterparty  it incurs credit risk  or the risk of losses if borrowers do not repay their loans or counterparties fail to perform according to the term of their contract 
the corporation allows for and reserves against credit risks based on its assessment of credit losses inherent in its loan portfolio including unfunded credit commitments 
the process for determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses is critical to the corporation s financial condition and results of operations 
it requires difficult  subjective and complex judgments  including forecasts of economic conditions and how these economic predictions might impair the ability of borrowers to repay their loans 
as is the case with any such assessments  there is always the chance that the corporation will fail to identify the proper factors or that it will fail to accurately estimate the impacts of factors that are identified 
for further discussion of credit risk and the corporation s credit risk management policies and procedures  refer to credit risk management and loan quality in the md a 
changes in market prices of managed assets 
the corporation earns fee income from managing assets for others and providing brokerage services 
since investment management fees are often based on the value of assets under management  a fall in the market prices of those assets could reduce the corporation s fee income 
changes in stock market prices could affect the trading activity of investors  reducing commissions and other fees earned from the brokerage business 
changes in accounting standards 
the corporation s accounting policies are fundamental to understanding it financial condition and results of operations 
some of these policies require the use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of assets or liabilities and financial results 
several of our accounting policies are critical because they require management to make difficult  subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
for a description of the corporation s critical accounting policies  refer to critical accounting policies in the md a 
from time to time the financial accounting standards board fasb  the sec and other regulatory bodies  change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of external financial statements 
these changes are beyond the corporation s control  can be difficult to predict and could materially impact how it reports financial condition and results of operations 
in some cases  the corporation could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively  resulting in the restatement of prior period financial statements 
federal and state regulations 
the corporation  the banks and non banking subsidiaries are subject to extensive state and federal regulation  supervision and legislation that govern almost all aspects of its operations 
these regulations protect depositors  federal deposit insurance funds  consumers and the banking system as a whole  not stockholders 
the corporation and its non banking subsidiaries are also heavily regulated by securities regulators 
this regulation is designed to protect investors in securities we sell or underwrite 
congress and state legislatures and foreign  federal and state regulatory agencies continually review laws  regulations and policies for possible changes 
changes to statutes  regulations or regulatory policies  including interpretation or implementation of statutes  regulations or policies  could affect the corporation in substantial and unpredictable ways including limiting the types of financial services and products it may offer and increasing the ability of non banks to offer competing financial services and products 
implementation of regulatory changes could also be costly to the corporation 
governmental fiscal and monetary policy 
the corporation s earnings are affected by domestic and international monetary policy 
for example  the board of governors of the federal reserve system regulates the supply of money and credit in the 
table of contents united states 
these policies  to a large extent  determine the corporation s cost of funds for lending and investing and the returns earned on those loans and investments  both of which affect net interest margin 
these policies can also affect the value of financial instruments  such as debt securities and mortgage servicing rights as well affecting borrowers by potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans 
the corporations earnings are also affected by the fiscal policies that are adopted by various regulatory authorities of puerto rico and the united states 
changes in tax laws can have a potentially adverse impact on the corporation s earnings 
changes in domestic and international monetary and fiscal policies are beyond the corporation s control and are difficult to predict 
liquidity risk 
liquidity is essential to business and could be impaired by an inability to access the capital markets or unforeseen outflows of cash 
this situation may arise due to circumstances that the corporation may be unable to control  such as a general market disruption 
the corporation s credit ratings are important to its liquidity 
a reduction in credit ratings could adversely affect its liquidity and competitive position  increase borrowing costs  limit access to the capital markets 
for a further discussion of the corporation s liquidity  refer to liquidity risk in the md a 
operational risk 
the corporation is exposed to operational risk 
in its daily operations  the corporation relies on the continued efficacy of its technical and telecommunication systems  operational infrastructure  relationships with third parties and the vast array of associates and key executives in its day to day and ongoing operations 
failure by any or all of these resources subjects the corporation to risks that may vary in size  scale and scope 
this includes but is not limited to operational or technical failures  ineffectiveness or exposure due to interruption in third party support as expected  the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders  unauthorized transactions by employees or operational errors including clerical or recordkeeping errors  as well as  the loss of key individuals or failure on the part of the key individuals to perform properly 
reputational risk 
the corporation is subject to reputation risk  or the risk to earnings and capital from negative public opinion 
the corporation s ability to attract and retain customers and employees could be adversely affected to the extent its reputation is damaged 
the corporation s failure to address  or to appear to fail to address various issues that could give rise to reputational risk could cause harm to the corporation and its business prospects and could lead to litigation and regulatory action 
these issues include  but are not limited to  appropriately addressing potential conflicts of interest  legal and regulatory requirements  ethical issues  money laundering  privacy  properly maintaining customer and associated personal information  record keeping  sales and trading practices  and the proper identification of the legal  reputational  credit  liquidity  and market risks inherent in its products 
merger risk 
there are significant risks associated with mergers 
future business acquisitions could be material to the corporation and could require the issuance of additional capital or incurring of debt 
in that event  the corporation could become more susceptible to economic downturns and competitive pressures 
merger risk includes the possibility that projected growth opportunities and cost savings fail to be realized  and that the integration process results in the loss of key employees  or that the disruption of ongoing business from the merger could adversely affect the corporation s ability to maintain relationships with customers 
litigation risk 
the volume of claims and the amount of damages and penalties claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions remains high 
substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against the corporation could have material adverse financial effects or cause significant reputational harm to the corporation  which could result in serious financial consequences 
the sec and other government agencies are currently conducting investigations of mortgage loan transfers and related transactions among several puerto rico banking institutions  the corporation is unable to predict whether or to what extent such investigations will have adverse effects on the corporation

all accompanying tables  financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this report should be considered an integral part of this analysis 
during  the corporation has concentrated its efforts in consolidating its financial position and market share 
during the year the corporation reported significant improvements in net income before tax  capital and asset quality ratios as well as in the efficiency ratio 
the credit quality of the corporation s loan portfolio continued to improve during resulting in a lower provision for loan losses 
the corporation has been impacted by higher income taxes in the corporation  during continued monitoring its business plan prepared in for the three year period from through this plan is based on an integrated business model that focuses on the corporation s clients and people 
the corporation s client focused business model is based on three strategic cornerstones sales and distribution  credit and market risk and operating efficiency 
the sales and distribution cornerstone is aimed at implementing and expanding a systematic sales management process which focuses on growing the loan portfolio by cross selling products and services to the corporation s extensive segmented client base and improving client profitability 
in the area of credit and market risk the corporation is focused on implementing and maintaining agile and flexible credit processes  continuous monitoring and improvement of asset quality  maximizing loan recoveries and maintaining an investment portfolio proportional to the corporation s asset size

the corporation s business plan is based on improving client information and providing the highest quality services with the best human resources and information technology  while maintaining superior asset quality 
management s efforts are focused on achieving the objectives delineated in the business plan

continued emphasis on the growth of the insurance agency and broker dealer segments is also expected to have a positive impact on the corporation s results of operations 
cost control measures currently in place should limit the growth in operating expenses and assist in achieving greater operational efficiency 
these strategies are expected to enhance the corporation s profitability and efficiency ratios 
the corporation s business plan depends  to a certain extent  on the improvement of general economic conditions and stable economic growth in puerto rico and in the united states 
in addition  the business plan places special emphasis on the very competitive environment for financial services in puerto rico and the united states 
on a short and medium term basis  the corporation will continue to focus on differentiating itself from its competitors by building on its established strengths client satisfaction  product innovation  diversified business units with high earnings potential from banking  securities  asset management  mortgage and insurance services  its large client base and branch distribution network and a modern technology infrastructure 
based on the results of operations and financial condition obtained for the year ended december   as detailed throughout this discussion  management believes it has been successful in implementing its business plan and expects to continue with the changes that have been implemented in order to achieve its objectives 
the corporation reported net income of million for the year ended december   or per common share decreasing million or from million as of december  this decrease was principally due to an increase of million in the provision for income tax to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in earnings per common share for the year ended december  were decreasing by from for the year ended december  return on average common equity roe and return on average assets roa were and  respectively  for the year ended december   reflecting a decrease of basis points in roe and basis points in roa when compared to roe and roa of and  respectively  for the year ended december  the efficiency ratio on a tax equivalent basis for the year ended december   was  an improvement of basis point compared for the same period in income before provision for income tax was million  an increase of million or for the year ended december   compared with million for the same period in this change was principally attributed to an increase of million or and million or in net interest income after provision for loan losses and other 
table of contents income  for the year ended in december  compared with the year ended december  this increase was offset by an increase of million or in other expenses 
the corporation s principal source of revenues is net interest income  which is the difference between the interest earned on loans and investments and the interest paid on customer deposits and other interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income represents approximately of the corporation s total revenues defined as net interest income plus other income for net interest income is affected by the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and the interest rates earned or paid on these balances 
lending activities are one of the most important aspects of the corporation s operations 
as a result of management s focus on regaining market share  the net loan portfolio continued to increase during the net loan portfolio  including loans held for sale  increased billion  or reaching billion at december   compared to billion at december  due to the continued effort to improve credit quality  the higher proportion of mortgage loans which have historically proven to be of low risk and the significant improvement in nonperforming loans  the allowance for loan losses decreased for the year ended december  compared with the same period in the provision for loan losses totaled million in  a decrease of million compared to million in the improvement in the asset quality ratios reflects the success of management s initiatives in improving credit quality  such as the revision of underwriting standards and improvements in the collection process 
the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans decreased to at december   from at december  although the corporation has diversified its sources of revenues  interest income from the loan portfolio continues to account for the majority of total revenues  representing of total gross revenues for as a result  the primary influence on the corporation s operating results is the demand for loans in puerto rico  which is significantly affected by economic conditions  competition  the demand and supply of housing  the fiscal policies of the federal and puerto rico governments and interest rate levels 
changes in interest rates  the corporation s principal market risk  can significantly impact its results of operations by affecting net interest income and the gains or losses realized on the sale of loans and securities 
as described under risk management  the corporation uses derivative instruments to hedge  to a limited extent  its interest rate risk in order to protect its net interest income under different interest rate scenarios 
the corporation has continued to diversify its revenues sources  mainly as a result of the acquisition of santander securities  its broker dealer subsidiary  from an affiliate in december broker dealer  asset management and insurance fees accounted for of the corporation s other income and of its total revenues for the corporation also earns revenues from other sources that are not as dependent on interest levels  such as bank service fees on deposit accounts and credit card fees  other income  including broker dealer  asset management and insurance fees  accounted for of total revenues for operating expenses increased million or in compared to  well below the level of inflation 
this increase was mainly due to an increase of million in personnel costs  million in occupancy cost and million in business promotion  which were partially offset by a decrease in edp servicing  amortization and technical expenses of million 
deposits at december  were billion  reflecting an increase of million or compared to deposits of billion as of december  this increase was also in line with the objective of enhancing customer activity and market share 
total borrowings at december  comprised of federal funds purchased and other borrowings  securities sold under agreements to repurchase  commercial paper issued  term and capital notes decreased million compared to total borrowings for the year ended december  the subordinated notes increased by million or due to a new issuance of notes for million in the last quarter of as of december   the company had billion in customer financial assets under management 
this is a significant part of the financial assets of puerto rico households and reflects the corporation s strong positioning in its primary market 
customer financial assets under management include bank deposits excluding brokered deposits  broker dealer customer accounts  mutual fund assets managed  and trust  institutional and private accounts under management 
the growth in customer financial assets and the stability of customer deposits is a strong indication of the corporation s successful efforts to regain market share and reposition as a leading provider of financial services 
sbp common stock price per share was as of december  resulting in a market capitalization of billion including affiliated holdings 

table of contents during the fourth quarter of  santander bancorp declared and paid a cash dividend of cents per common share to its shareholders of record  resulting in a current annual dividend yield of 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements of santander bancorp are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and with general practices within the financial services industry 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements  management is required to make judgments  involving significant estimates and assumptions  in the application of its accounting policies about matters that are inherently uncertain 
management arrives at these estimates and assumptions  which may materially affect the reported amounts of certain assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  considering the facts and circumstances at a specific point in time 
changes in those facts and circumstances could produce actual results that differ from those estimates 
detailed below is a discussion of the corporation s critical accounting policies 
these policies are critical because they are highly dependent upon subjective or complex judgments  assumptions and estimates 
for a complete discussion of the corporation s significant and critical accounting policies refer to the notes to the consolidated financial statements and the discussion throughout this document which should be read in conjunction with this section 
allowance for loan losses 
the corporation assesses the overall risks in its loan portfolio and establishes and maintains a reserve for probable losses thereon 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level sufficient to provide for estimated loan losses based on the evaluation of known and inherent risks in the corporation s loan portfolio 
the corporation s management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on a monthly basis 
the determination of the allowance for loan losses is one of the most complex and critical accounting estimates the corporation s management makes 
the allowance for loan losses is composed of three different components 
an asset specific reserve based on the provisions of statements of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan as amended  an expected loss estimate based on the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for contingencies  and an unallocated reserve based on the effect of probable economic deterioration above and beyond what is reflected in the asset specific component of the allowance 
commercial and construction loans exceeding a predetermined monetary threshold are identified for evaluation of impairment on an individual basis pursuant to sfas no 
the corporation considers a loan impaired when interest and or principal is past due days or more  or  when based on current information and events it is probable that the corporation will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the asset specific reserve on each individual loan identified as impaired is measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  except as a practical expedient  the corporation may measure impairment based on the loan s observable market price  or the fair value of the collateral  net of estimated disposal costs  if the loan is collateral dependent 
most of the asset specific reserves of the corporation s impaired loans are measured on the basis of the fair value of the collateral 
a reserve for expected losses is determined under the provisions of sfas no 
for all loans not evaluated individually for impairment  based on historical loss experience by loan type  management judgment of the quantitative factors historical net charge offs  statistical loss estimates  etc  as well as qualitative factors current economic conditions  portfolio composition  delinquency trends  industry concentrations  etc the corporation groups small homogeneous loans by type of loan consumer  credit card  mortgage  auto  etc 
and applies a loss factor  which is determined using an average history of actual net losses over the previous to years and other statistical loss estimates 
historical loss rates are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted based on changing borrower and or collateral conditions and actual collections and charge off experience 
historical loss rates for the different portfolios may be adjusted for significant factors that in management s judgment reflect the impact of any current conditions on loss recognition 
factors that management considers in the analysis include the effect of the trends in the nature and volume of loans delinquency  charge offs  non accrual  changes in the mix or type of collateral  asset quality trends  changes in the internal lending policies and credit standards  collection practices and examination results from internal and external agencies 
an additional or unallocated reserve is maintained to cover the effect of probable economic deterioration above and beyond what is reflected in the asset specific component of the allowance 
this component represents management s view that given the complexities of the lending portfolio and the assessment process  including the inherent imprecision in the financial models used in the loss forecasting process  there are estimable losses that have been incurred but not yet specifically identified  and as a result not fully provided for in the asset specific component of the allowance 
the level of the unallocated reserve may change periodically after evaluating factors impacting assumptions used in the calculation of the asset specific component of the reserve 
the underlying assumptions  estimates and assessments used by management to determine the components of the allowance for loan losses are periodically evaluated and updated to reflect management s current view of overall economic conditions and other relevant factors impacting credit quality and inherent losses 
changes in such estimates could significantly impact the 
table of contents allowance and provision for loan losses 
the corporation could experience loan losses that are different from the current estimates made by management 
based on current and expected economic conditions  the expected level of net loan losses and the methodology established to evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  management considers that the corporation has established an adequate position in its allowance for loan losses 
refer to the allowance for loan losses section for further information 
valuation of certain financial instruments 
certain financial instruments including derivatives  hedged items  trading and investment securities available for sale  are recorded at fair value and unrealized gains and losses are recorded in other comprehensive income or other gains and losses  as appropriate 
fair values for most of the corporation s trading and investment securities are based on listed market prices  if available 
if listed market prices are not available  fair value is determined based on other relevant factors including price quotations for similar instruments 
for securities where listed market prices are not readily available  the determination of the fair value requires management judgment as to the benchmark to be used 
significant changes in factors such as interest rates and accelerated prepayment rates could affect the value of the trading and investment securities 
management assesses the fair value of its portfolio at least monthly 
any impairment that is considered other than temporary is recorded in the consolidated statement of income 
fair values for certain derivative contracts are derived from pricing models that consider current market and contractual prices for the underlying financial instruments  counterparty credit risk  as well as time value and yield curve or volatility factors underlying the positions 
management applies judgment in determining the models used and required adjustment to such models  if any  in the valuation process 
the primary risk of material changes to the value of the derivative instruments is fluctuations in interest rates 
however  the corporation principally uses derivative instruments as part of a designated hedging program so that a change in the value of a derivative is generally offset by a corresponding change in the value of the hedged item 
changes in these estimates may have a significant impact on the carrying amount and the related valuation gains and losses on these financial instruments 
management believes that its estimates of fair value are reasonable given the process of obtaining external prices  periodic reviews of internal models by affiliated and unaffiliated experts  and the consistent application of methodologies 
transfers of financial assets 
the corporation occasionally engages in transfers of financial assets and accounts for them in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities a replacement of fasb statement no 
sfas no 

paragraph of sfas no 
provides that a transfer of financial assets in which the transferor surrenders control over those financial assets shall be accounted for as a sale to the extent that consideration other than beneficial interests in the transferred assets is received in exchange 
a transferor has surrendered control if all of the following conditions are met a the transferred assets have been isolated from the transferor put presumptively beyond the reach of creditors  even in bankruptcy  b each transferee has the right to pledge or exchange the assets it received and no condition constrains the transferee from taking advantage of its right to pledge or exchange  and c the transferor does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets through either i an agreement that both entitles and obligates the transferor to repurchase or redeem them before their maturity or ii the ability to unilaterally cause the holder to return specified assets  other than through a cleanup call 
in accordance with sfas no 
 a gain or loss on the sale is recognized based on the carrying amount of the financial assets involved in the transfer  allocated between the assets transferred and the retained interests based on their relative fair value at the date of transfer 
when the corporation transfers financial assets and the transfer fails any one of the sfas no 
sales criteria  the corporation is not permitted to derecognize the transferred financial assets and the transaction is accounted for as a secured borrowing 
we have restated our financial statements for each year of the five years in the period ended december  and for the first  second and third quarters of and in order to correct the accounting under sfas no 
of certain mortgage loan transfers 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements  the corporation is required to estimate income taxes 
this involves an estimation of current income tax expense together with an assessment of temporary differences resulting from differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
the determination of current income tax expense involves estimates and assumptions that require the corporation to assume certain positions based on its interpretation of current tax regulations 
changes in assumptions affecting estimates may be required in the future and estimated tax liabilities may need to be increased or decreased accordingly 
the accrual for tax contingencies is adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of tax audits  case law and emerging legislation 
the corporation s effective tax rate includes the impact of tax contingency accruals and changes to such accruals  including related interest and penalties  as considered appropriate by management 
when particular matters arise  a number of years may elapse before such matters are audited by the taxing authorities and finally resolved 
favorable resolution of such matters  or the expiration of the statute of limitations may result in the release of tax contingencies which are recognized as a reduction to the corporation s effective rate in the year of resolution 
unfavorable settlement of any particular issue could increase the effective rate and may require the use of cash in the year of resolution 
the determination of deferred tax expense or benefit is based on changes in the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that generate temporary differences 
the carrying value of the corporation s net deferred tax assets assumes that the corporation will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income based on estimates and assumptions 
if these estimates and related assumptions change  the corporation may be required to record valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets resulting in 
table of contents additional income tax expense in the consolidated statements of income 
management evaluates its deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis and assesses the need for a valuation allowance 
a valuation allowance is established when management believes that it is more likely than not that some portion of its deferred tax assets will not be realized 
changes in valuation allowance from period to period are included in the corporation s tax provision in the period of change 
during the year ended december   the corporation had no recorded valuation allowances related to its net deferred tax assets see note to the consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill represents the excess of an acquired company s acquisition cost over the fair value of its net tangible and intangible assets 
goodwill is not amortized but rather are tested at least annually for impairment using a two step process at each reporting unit 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  the goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not performed 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step in the impairment test consists of comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
the corporation s goodwill  resulted from business acquisitions  and consists of million that resulted from the acquisition by the bank of banco central hispano pr  and million that resulted from the acquisition by santander securities of the acquisition of merryl lynch s retail brokerage business in puerto rico 
the value of the goodwill is inherent primarily in the commercial banking segment and the broker dealer segment  respectively 
the sustained value of the goodwill is supported ultimately by revenue from the commercial banking segment and the broker dealer segment 
a decline in earnings as a result of a lack of growth  or our inability to deliver cost effective services over sustained periods  could lead to a perceived impairment of goodwill  which would be evaluated and  if necessary be recorded as a write down in the consolidated statement of income 
on an annual basis  or more frequently if circumstances dictate  management reviews goodwill and evaluates events or other developments that may indicate impairment in the carrying amount 
the evaluation for potential impairment is inherently complex  and involves significant judgment in the use of estimates and assumptions 
to determine the fair value of the reporting units being evaluated for goodwill impairment  the corporation used an independent consultant 
the determination of the fair value of the reporting units involves the use of estimates and assumptions including expected results of operations  an assumed discount rate and an assumed growth rate for the reporting units 
specifically  the independent consultant prepared analyses regarding the fair value of equity of the corporation s reporting units  commercial banking and broker dealer 
the consultant used three separate approaches market multiple approach provides indications of value based upon comparisons of the reporting unit to market values and pricing evidence of public companies in the same or similar lines of businesses 
market ratios pricing multiples and performance fundamentals relating the public companies stock prices equity or enterprise values to certain underlying fundamental data are applied to the reporting unit to determine indications of its fair value 
discounted cash flow approach calculates the present value of the projected future cash flows to be generated by the reporting unit using appropriate discount rates 
the discount rates are intended to reflect all associated risks of realizing the projected future cash flows 
terminal values are computed as of the end of the last period for which cash flows are projected to determine an estimate of the values of the reporting unit as of that future point in time 
discounting the terminal values back to the present and adding the present values of the future cash flows yields indications of the reporting unit s fair value 
comparable transaction approach includes an examination of recent transactions in which companies involved in the same or similar lines of business to the reporting unit were acquired 
acquisition values and pricing evidence are used in much the same manner as the market multiple approach for indication of the reporting unit s fair value 
events that may indicate goodwill impairment include significant or adverse changes in the business  economic or political climate  unanticipated competition  adverse action or assessment by a regulator  plans for disposition of a segment  among others 
intangible assets  with an indefinite life  are not amortized and are tested for impairment at least annually comparing the fair value with the carrying amount of those assets 
in determining the indefinite life for those assets  the corporation considers the expected cash flows and several factors such as legal  regulatory  economic  contractual  competition and others  which could limit the useful life 

table of contents tangible and intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
useful lives are based on management s estimates of the period that the assets will generate revenue 
if circumstances and conditions indicate deterioration in the value of tangible assets and intangible assets with finite useful lives  the book value would be adjusted and a loss would be recognized in current operations 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and other intangibles  the corporation must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  the corporation may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
based on management s assessment of the value of the corporation s goodwill at october   and  which includes an independent valuation  among others  management determined that the corporation s goodwill and other intangible were not impaired 
pension and other postemployment benefits 
the determination of the corporation s obligation and expense for pension and other postretirement benefits is dependent on the selection of certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts 
those assumptions are described in note to the consolidated financial statements and include  among others  the discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets and rates of increase in compensation and healthcare costs 
management participates in the determination of these factors  which normally undergo evaluation against industry assumptions  among other factors 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  actual results that differ from the corporation s assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore  generally affect recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods 
the corporation uses an independent actuarial firm for the determination of the pension and post retirement benefit costs and obligations 
in developing the expected return on plan assets  the corporation considers the asset allocation  historical returns on the types of assets held in the pension trust  the current economic environment  as well as input from the actuaries  financial analysts and the corporation s long term inflation assumptions and interest rate scenarios 
the expected rate of return for plan assets was set at for the years ended december   and in selecting a discount rate  the corporation considers the moody s long term aa corporate bond yield as a guide 
at december   the corporation s discount rate was 
management believes that the assumptions made are appropriate  however  significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect pension obligations and future expense 
results of operations the following financial discussion is based upon and should be read in conjunction with the corporation s consolidated financial statements for the years ended december    and the earnings per share computations for all periods presented in the accompanying financial information have been adjusted retroactively to reflect the stock dividend declared by the board of directors on july  refer to the section on capital and dividends below 
the following table sets forth the principal components of the corporation s net income for the years ended december   and dollars in thousands components of net income net interest income provision for loan losses other income other operating expenses provision benefit for income tax net income compared to the corporation s net income decreased million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the same period in this effect was principally due to an increase of million and million in provision for income tax and in other operating expenses  respectively 
these changes were partially offset by an increase in 
table of contents net interest income and other income of million and million  respectively  and a decrease in a provision for loan losses of million 
compared to the increase of million  or  in net income for the year ended december  compared to the same period in  was principally due to an increase of million in net interest income  mainly as a result of increase in the volume of interest earning assets  a decrease in the provision for loan losses of million  a decrease in operating expenses of million and an increase in other income of million due primarily to a gain on sale of building and higher broker dealer  asset management and insurance fees 
these changes were partially offset by increases in the provision for income tax of million 
net interest income the corporation s net interest income was million  million and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
to facilitate the comparison of assets with different tax attributes  the interest income on tax exempt assets under this heading and under the heading change in interest income and interest expense volume and rate analysis  has been adjusted by an amount equal to the income taxes which would have been paid had the interest income been fully taxable 
this tax equivalent adjustment is derived using the applicable statutory tax rate and resulted in an adjustment of million in  million in and million in the following table sets forth the principal components of the corporation s net interest income for the years ended december   and dollars in thousands interest income tax equivalent basis interest expense net interest income tax equivalent basis net interest margin tax equivalent basis net interest margin for any period equals tax equivalent net interest income divided by average interest earning assets for such period 
compared to the higher short term interest rate scenario has impacted the corporation s net interest margin during the increase in short term in interest rates was mainly due to the increase of the discount rate by the federal reserve 
the increasing short term rate with only a minor repricing of long term rates has resulted in a flattening of the yield curve 
the corporation s tax equivalent net interest income for the year ended december  was million  decreasing million or from million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to an increase in cost of funds of basis points from in to in  together with an increase in average interest bearing liabilities of million 
this was partially offset by an increase in average interest earning assets of million and an increase in the yield of such assets of basis points from on to in interest expense on average interest bearing liabilities increased million or compared with the same period in interest expense on other time deposits including brokered deposits reflected an increase of million or to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in total cost of funds increased basis points in compared to  due to an increase in rates paid on deposits as a result of the higher interest rate scenario 
this increase contributed to the decrease in net interest margin of basis points to and of an increase in cost of funding earning assets of basis points to for the year ended december  the increase in average interest bearing liabilities of million or to billion for the year ended december  compared with billion for the same period in was due to an increase in average interest bearing deposits of million 
the increase in average interest bearing deposits was due to an increase in average other time deposits of million or including an increase in brokered deposits of million or 
this increment was partially offset 
table of contents by a decrease in borrowings comprised of federal funds purchased and other borrowings  securities sold under agreements of repurchase and commercial paper issued of million or compared with the same period in average securities sold under agreements to repurchase decreased by  in part by the extinguishment of certain repurchase agreements during the first quarter and management s emphasis in using lower cost borrowings 
average federal funds purchased and other borrowings increased by million or for the year ended december  average subordinated notes also increased by million or due to a new note issuance of million in the last quarter of the corporation s interest income on a tax equivalent basis reflected an increase of million or compared with the same period in this change was due to an increase of million or in interest earned on the average loan portfolio partially offset by a decrease of million or in average investment portfolio 
average interest earning assets increased million in compared to this increase was due to an increase in average net loans of billion or to billion for the year ended december  compared with billion for the same period in this improvement was partially offset by a decrease in average investment securities of or million 
pursuant to management s objective of increasing its mortgage loan lending activity during  the average mortgage loan portfolio reached billion  reflecting an increase of or million compared with billion for the year ended december  total mortgage loan originations and gross purchases from third parties in were million and million  respectively 
total sales to third parties were million for the year ended december  the average consumer loan portfolio grew or million reaching million for the year ended december  this increase was a result of an improvement of average credit card and average personal loans of and  to million and million  respectively 
there was an increase in the average commercial loan portfolio and lease financing portfolio of and  to billion and million  respectively  for the year ended december  the increase in the average net loan portfolio was offset by a decrease in average investment securities of million or 
the decrease in average investment securities was mainly attributed to the sale of million of securities during the first quarter of which also resulted in a reduction in the yield on investment securities of basis points from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the above mentioned sale generated a gain of million that was partially offset by a loss of million on the extinguishment of certain term repo transactions that were financing part of the securities sold 
compared to the corporation s tax equivalent net interest income for the year ended december  reached million  an increase of over million for the same period in this improvement was due to an increase in average interest earning assets of million  or  as a result of an increase in commercial activities as well as a reduction in total cost of funds of basis points 
although the corporation s net interest margin decreased during  to from for  net interest spread remained stable compared with as a result of an increase in tax equivalent  interest income of million partially offset by an increase in interest expenses of million 
the increase in average interest earning assets was driven primarily by the increase in average loans 
average commercial loans experienced an increase of or million 
construction loans reflected a decrease of or million due to a slowdown in the construction sector of the island and a stronger emphasis by the corporation on mortgage lending 
due to the continued low interest rate scenario the average mortgage loan portfolio reflected a growth of or million

allowance for loan losses the corporation systematically assesses the overall risks in its loan portfolio and establishes and maintains an allowance for probable losses thereon 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level sufficient to provide for estimated loan losses based on the evaluation of known and inherent risks in its loan portfolio 
management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on a monthly basis 
this evaluation involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions and estimates that are subject to revision  as more information becomes available 
in determining the allowance  management considers the portfolio risk characteristics  prior loss experience  prevailing and projected economic conditions  loan impairment 
table of contents measurements and the results of its internal and regulatory agencies loan reviews 
based on current and expected economic conditions  the expected level of net loan losses and the methodology established to evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  management considers that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb probable losses in the corporation s loan portfolio 
commercial and construction loans over a predetermined amount are individually evaluated on a quarterly basis for impairment following the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting by creditors of a loan 
a loan is impaired when based on current information and events  it is probable that the corporation will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the impairment loss  if any  on each individual loan identified as impaired is measured based on the present value of expected cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  except as a practical expedient  impairment may be measured based on the loan s observable market price  or the fair value of the collateral  if the loan is collateral dependent 
substantially all of the corporation impaired loans are measured on the basis of the fair value of the collateral  net of estimated disposition costs 
the corporation maintains a detailed analysis of all loans identified as impaired with their corresponding allowances and the specific component of the allowance is computed on a quarterly basis 
additions  deletions or adjustments to the analysis are tracked and formal justification is documented detailing the rationale for such adjustments 
for small  homogeneous type of loans  a general allowance is computed based on average historical loss experience or ratios for each corresponding type of loans consumer  credit cards  residential mortgages  auto  etc the methodology of accounting for all probable losses is made in accordance with the guidance provided by statement of accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
in determining the general allowance  the corporation applies a loss factor for each type of loan based on the average historical net charge off for the previous two or three years for each portfolio adjusted for other statistical loss estimates  as deemed appropriate 
historical loss rates are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted based on changes in actual collections and charge off experience as well as significant factors that in management s judgment reflect the impact of any current conditions on loss recognition 
factors that management considers in the analysis of the general reserve include the effect of the trends in the nature and volume of loans delinquency  charge offs and non accrual loans  changes in the mix or type of collateral  asset quality trends  changes in the internal lending policies and credit standards  collection practices and examination results from bank regulatory agencies 
the determination of the allowance for loan losses under sfas no 
is based on historical loss experience by loan type  management judgment of the quantitative factors historical net charge offs  statistical loss estimates  etc  as well as qualitative factors current economic conditions  portfolio composition  delinquency trends  industry concentrations  etc  which result in the final determination of the provision for loan losses to maintain a level of allowance for loan losses deemed to be adequate 
the corporation s methodology for allocating the allowance among the different parts of the portfolio or different elements of the allowance is based on the historical loss percentages for each type or pool of loan consumer  commercial  construction  mortgage and other  after assigning the specific allowances for impaired loans on an individual review process 
the sum of specific allowances for impaired loans plus the general allowances for each type of loan not specifically examined constitutes the total allowance for loan losses at the end of any reporting period 
an unallocated allowance is maintained to absorb changes and unexpected losses that may result from certain significant external factors  such as a the corporation s moderate concentration in certain industries  especially health care  and agriculture businesses  b the slow growth of the puerto rico economy as evidenced by high unemployment figures  c the broad negative effect on the puerto rico economy of the increased price of oil and oil related products  d interest rate forecasts and e the negative collateral economic effect of the war in iraq or additional terrorist attacks both of which add material risk to the economy and curtail economic recovery 
this allowance is based primarily on historical experience  current trends in factors such as bankruptcies and loss trends among others 
on a quarterly basis  management reviews its determination of the allowance for loan losses which includes the specific allowance computed according to the provisions of sfas no 
and the general allowance for small  homogenous type of loans  which is based on historical loss percentages for each type or pool of loan 
this analysis also considers loans classified by the internal loan review department  the internal auditors  the in house watch system unit  and banking regulators 
the corporation has not changed any aspects of its overall approach in the determination of the allowance for loan losses  and there have been no material changes in assumptions or estimation techniques  as compared to prior periods

the portfolio with the highest level of non performing loans during the year was the mortgage loan portfolio  which is fully collateralized and in which the corporation has historically experienced a very low level of charge offs 
excluding non performing mortgage loans this ratio is compared to as of december  the annualized ratio of net charge offs to average loans for the year ended december  decreased basis points to from for the same period in net charge offs for the year ended december  were significantly lower than those for the same period in due to more stringent lending criteria  aggressive collection efforts and continuous monitoring of the loan portfolio 
consumer loan charge offs continued reflecting improvement during with a reduction of million or 
the allowance for loan losses decreased million from million at december  to million at december  at december   impaired loans loans evaluated individually for impairment and it s related allowance amounted to approximately million and million  respectively 
net charge offs of million were partially offset by a provision of million for the year ended lower net charge offs in together with the lower non performing loans resulted in a lower provision for loan losses while still maintaining an allowance for loan losses to year end loans of

once a loan is placed on non accrual status  interest is recorded as income only to the extent of the corporation s management expectations regarding the full collectibility of principal and interest on such loans 
the interest income that would have been realized had these loans been performing in accordance with their original terms amounted to million in  million in and million in there was a reduction in total non performing loans of from million at december  to million at year ended december  this change came from a reduction in commercial loan portfolio without real estate collateral of compared with prior year figures to million in from million in the construction and consumer loan portfolios also reflected decreases during the year ended december  of or million and or million  respectively 
non performing mortgage loans increased million or of to million at december  from at december  historically  this portfolio experienced the lowest rates of losses 
repossessed assets decreased million or to million at december   from million at december   as a result of various sales of real estate owned properties during the year

table of contents potential problem loans as a general rule  the corporation closely monitors certain loans not disclosed under non performing assets and past due loans but that represent a greater than normal credit risk 
these loans are not included under the non performing category  but management provides close supervision of their performance 
the identification process is implemented through various risk management procedures  such as periodic review of customer relationships  a risk grading system  an internal watch system and a loan review process 
this classification system enables management to respond to changing circumstances and to address the risk that may arise from changing business conditions or any other factors that bear significantly on the overall condition of these loans 
the principal amounts of loans under this category as of december  and were approximately million and million  respectively 
asset and liability management the corporation s policy with respect to asset and liability management is to maximize its net interest income  return on assets and return on equity while remaining within the established parameters of interest rate and liquidity risks provided by the board of directors and the relevant regulatory authorities 
subject to these constraints  the corporation takes mismatched interest rate positions 
the corporation s asset and liability management policies are developed and implemented by its asset and liability committee alco  which is composed of senior members of the corporation including the president  chief operating officer  chief accounting officer  treasurer and other executive officers of the corporation 
the alco reports on a monthly basis to the board of directors 
market risk and interest rate sensitivity a key component of the corporation s asset and liability policy is the management of interest rate sensitivity 
interest rate sensitivity is the relationship between market interest rates and net interest income due to the maturity or repricing characteristics of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
for any given period  the pricing structure is matched when an equal amount of such assets and liabilities mature or reprice in that period 
any mismatch of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities is known as a gap position 
a positive gap denotes asset sensitivity  which means that an increase in interest rates would have a positive effect on net interest income  while a decrease in interest rates would have a negative effect on net interest income 
the corporation is experiencing a negative gap at december  with a one year cumulative gap of billion 
this denotes liability sensitivity  which means that an increase in interest rates would have a negative effect on net interest income while a decrease in interest rates would have a positive effect on net interest income 
the corporation s interest rate sensitivity strategy takes into account not only rates of return and the underlying degree of risk  but also liquidity requirements  capital costs and additional demand for funds 
the corporation s maturity mismatches and positions are monitored by the alco and are managed within limits established by the board of directors 
the following table sets forth the repricing of the corporation s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  and may not be representative of interest rate gap positions at other times 
in addition  variations in interest rate sensitivity may exist within the repricing periods presented due to the differing repricing dates within the period 
in preparing the interest rate gap report  the following assumptions are made  all assets and liabilities are reported according to their repricing characteristics 
for example  a commercial loan maturing in five years with monthly variable interest rate payments is stated in the column of up to days 
the investment portfolio is reported considering the effective duration of the securities 
expected prepayments and remaining terms are considered for the residential mortgage portfolio 
core deposits are reported in accordance with their effective duration 
effective duration of core deposits is based on price and volume elasticity to market rates 
the corporation reviews on a monthly basis the effective duration of core deposits 
assets and liabilities with embedded options are stated based on full valuation of the asset liability and the option to ascertain their effective duration

nearly all of the corporation s interest rate risk arises from instruments  positions and transactions entered into for purposes other than trading 
they include loans  investment securities  deposits  short term borrowings  senior and subordinated debt and derivative financial instruments used for asset and liability management 
as part of its interest rate risk management process  the corporation analyzes on an ongoing basis the profitability of the balance sheet structure  and how this structure will react under different market scenarios 
in order to carry out this task  management prepares three standardized reports with detailed information on the sources of interest income and expense the financial profitability report  the net interest income shock report  and the market value shock report 
the former deals with historical data while the latter two deal with expected future earnings 
the financial profitability report identifies individual components of the corporation s non trading portfolio independently with their corresponding interest income or expense 
it uses the historical information at the end of each month to track the yield of such components and to calculate net interest income for such time period 

table of contents the net interest income shock report uses a simulation analysis to measure the amount of net interest income the corporation would have from its operations throughout the next twelve months and the sensitivity of these earnings to assumed shifts in market interest rates throughout the same period 
the most important assumptions of this analysis are i rate shifts are parallel and immediate throughout the yield curve  ii rate changes affect all assets and liabilities equally  iii interest bearing demand accounts and savings passbooks will run off in a period of one year  and iv demand deposit accounts will run off in a period of one to three years 
cash flows from assets and liabilities are assumed to be reinvested at market rates in similar instruments 
the objective is to simulate a dynamic gap analysis enabling a more accurate interest rate risk assessment 
the alco has decided to maintain its negative interest rate gap in the current flat yield curve environment 
however it is not yet prepared to increase the duration of its investment portfolio with new acquisitions of securities until some steepening in the yield curve is observed 
any increase in the duration of its equity will only be achieved by an increase in the commercial activity of the corporation 
nim sensitivity analysis captures the maximum acceptable net interest margin loss for a one percent parallel change of all interest rates across the curve 
duration of market value equity analysis entails a valuation of all interest bearing assets and liabilities under parallel movements in interest rates 
the alco has established limits of million of maximum nim loss for a parallel shock and million maximum mve loss for a parallel shock 
as of december   it was determined for purposes of the net interest income shock report that the corporation had a potential loss in net interest income of approximately million if market rates were to increase basis points immediately and parallel across the yield curve  less than the million limit 
for purposes of the market value shock report it was determined that the corporation had a potential loss of approximately million if market rates were to increase basis points immediately parallel across the yield curve  less than the million limit 
as of december  the corporation had a liability sensitive profile as explained by the negative gap  the nim shock report and the mve shock report 
management feels comfortable with the current level of market risk on the balance sheet  and it will change the market risk profile of the corporation as market conditions vary 
any decision to reposition the balance sheet is taken by the alco committee  and is subject to compliance with the established risk limits 
some factors that could lead to shifts in policy could be  but are not limited to  changes in views on interest rate markets  monetary policy  macroeconomic factors as well as legal  fiscal and other factors which could lead to shifts in the asset liability mix 
derivatives the corporation uses derivative financial instruments mostly as hedges of interest rate risk  changes in fair value of assets and liabilities and to secure future cash flows 
refer to notes and to the consolidated financial statements for details of the corporation s derivative transactions as of december  and in the normal course of business  the corporation utilizes derivative instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates  currencies and other markets  to meet the needs of customers and for proprietary trading activities 
the corporation uses the same credit risk management procedures to assess and approve potential credit exposures when entering into derivative transactions as those used for traditional lending

at the inception of each hedge  management documents the hedging relationship  including its objective and probable effectiveness 
to assess ongoing effectiveness of the hedges  the corporation compares the hedged item s periodic variable rate with the hedging item s benchmark rate libor at every reporting period to determine the effectiveness of the hedge 
any hedge ineffectiveness is recorded currently as a derivative gain or loss in the income statement 

table of contents during  the corporation swapped million of term funds at fixed spread over us treasury securities 
these swaps were designated as cash flows hedges and matured in july as of december   the total amount  net of tax  included in accumulated other comprehensive income pertaining to the cash flow hedges was an unrealized loss of million 
as of december   the total amount  net of tax  included in accumulated other comprehensive income pertaining to the cash flow hedges was an unrealized loss of million 
fair value hedges the corporation designates hedges as fair value hedges when its main purpose is to hedge the changes in market value of an associated asset or liability 
the corporation only designates these types of hedges if at inception it is believed that the relationship of the changes in the market value of the hedged item and the hedging item will offset each other in a highly effective manner 
at the inception of each hedge  management documents the hedging relationship  including its objective and probable effectiveness 
to assess ongoing effectiveness of the hedges  the corporation marks to market both the hedging item and the hedged item at every reporting period to determine the effectiveness of the hedge 
any hedge ineffectiveness is recorded currently as a derivative gain or loss in the income statement 
the fair value hedges have maturities through the year as of december  and december  the weighted average rate paid and received on these contracts as of december  is and  respectively  and and  as of december   respectively 
the billion and million fair value hedges are associated to the swapping of fixed rate debt as of december  and  respectively 
the corporation regularly issues term fixed rate debt  which it in turn swaps to floating rate debt via interest rate swaps 
in these cases the corporation matches all of the relevant economic variables notional  coupon  payments dates and conventions etc 
of the fixed rate debt it issues to the fixed rate leg of the interest rate swap which it receives from the counterparty and pays the floating rate leg of the interest rate swap 
the effectiveness of these transactions is very high since all of the relevant economic variables are matched 
derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments any derivative not associated to hedging activity is booked as a freestanding derivative 
in the normal course of business the corporation may enter into derivative contracts as either a market maker or proprietary position taker 
the corporation s mission as a market maker is to meet the clients needs by providing them with a wide array of financial products  which include derivative contracts 
the corporation s major role in this aspect is to serve as a derivative counterparty to these clients 
positions taken with these clients are hedged although not designated as hedges in the otc market with interbank participants or in the organized futures markets 
to a lesser extent  the corporation enters into freestanding derivative contracts as a proprietary position taker  based on market expectations or to benefit from price differentials between financial instruments and markets 
these derivatives are not linked to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or to forecasted transactions in an accounting hedge relationship and  therefore  do not qualify for hedge accounting 
these derivatives are carried at fair value and changes in fair value are recorded in earnings 
the market and credit risk associated with these activities is measured  monitored and controlled by the corporation s market risk group  an independent division from the treasury department 
among other things  this group is responsible for policy  analysis  methodology and reporting of anything related to market risk and credit risk

in addition  there was an increase of  in freestanding derivatives 
liquidity risk liquidity risk is the risk that not enough cash will be generated from either assets or liabilities to meet deposit withdrawals or contractual loan funding 
the corporation s general policy is to maintain liquidity adequate to ensure our ability to honor withdrawals of deposits  make repayments at maturity of other liabilities  extend loans and meet working capital needs 
the corporation s principal sources of liquidity are capital  core deposits from retail and commercial clients  and wholesale deposits raised in the inter bank and commercial markets 
the corporation manages liquidity risk by maintaining diversified short term and long term sources through the federal funds market  commercial paper program  repurchase agreements and retail certificate of deposit programs 
as of december  the corporation had billion in unsecured lines of credit billion available and billion in collateralized lines of credit with banks and financial entities billion available 
all securities in portfolio are highly rated and very liquid  enabling us to treat them as a secondary source of liquidity 

table of contents the corporation does not have significant usage or limitations on its ability to upstream or downstream funds as a method of liquidity 
however  there are certain tax constraints when borrowing funds excluding the placement of deposits from bsch or affiliates because puerto rico s tax code requires local corporations to withhold of the interest income paid to non resident affiliates 
the corporation does not face significant limitations to its ability to downstream funds to its affiliates
