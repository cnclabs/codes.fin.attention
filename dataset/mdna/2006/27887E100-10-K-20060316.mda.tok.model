item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data set forth in item of this annual report on form k and the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in item of this annual report on form k 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition  accounting for stock based compensation  accounting for the issuance of debt obligations  valuation of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets  amortization of intangible assets  software development costs and income taxes are all critical accounting policies for the company 
the policies in effect in have been discussed with  and evaluated by  our audit committee and are substantially consistent with the policies in effect during and each of these policies is discussed in detail below  as well as in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
revenue recognition revenue recognition is a critical accounting policy for our company  as it affects the timing of when we recognize the fees we charge our customers for our services 
we recognize revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  as modified by sab  which provides guidance on revenue recognition for public companies 
revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we follow emerging issues task force eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  to identify units of accounting in revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
we follow eitf  reporting revenue gross as a principal vs 
net as an agent  for media services where the company is not at risk with vendors for services and the company receives a commission for such services 
for both divisions  the company enters into agreements that may contain multiple elements 
for multiple element arrangements  the company recognizes revenue for delivered elements only when the delivered item provides stand alone value to the customer  fair values of undelivered elements are known  customer acceptance has occurred and there are only customary refund or return rights related to the delivered elements 
recognized revenue is reflected as accrued revenue receivable on the consolidated balance sheets to the extent that the customer has not yet been billed for such services 
the company records deferred revenue for amounts received from or billed to customers in excess of revenue that has been earned 
the company also records a liability for customer deposits paid in advance of datamark s services 
elearning we enter into contracts with our customers to provide our online learning products and services 
our contracts typically have initial terms of one to three years 
each contract specifies the type and price of the online campus purchased and the number and price of online courses purchased  as well as the fees for student enrollments and any other products or services purchased 
since our customer contracts are generally applicable campus wide  colleges and universities can add new online programs and schools without the need to negotiate new contract terms 
the majority of our elearning division revenue is earned by charging a per enrollment student technology service fee to our customers for access to their ecourses and our help desk 
a smaller percentage of revenue is generated by our ecompanion product for which we typically charge an annual license fee for up to a predetermined number of users with the revenue being is recognized on a straight line basis over the contract year 
for our program administration solutions  we generally charge a one time set up and design fee to implement an online campus  and an annual license  hosting and maintenance fee for access to our software 
we sell our professional services on a fixed fee contract basis as well as standard hourly rates 
student fees are recognized on a per enrollment basis over each course s specific academic term or over the length of the student fee license purchased by the customer  depending upon contract terms 
an enrollment is generally defined as one user in one course for one academic term 
no billing occurs  and no revenue is recognized  for cancelled classes and student withdrawals or drops that occur before the agreed upon enrollment census date 
campus license  hosting  and maintenance fees  including the design and development of a customer s campus  are recognized on a straight line basis from the campus launch date through the end of the relevant contract period or the expected life of the customer relationship  whichever is greater 
the average recognition period for these campus fees is approximately three years 
professional services revenue is derived from either fixed fee or time and materials consulting contracts and recognized as services are performed 
we also offer customers the option to purchase blocks of course development service hours  based on our standard hourly rates 
revenue from these services is also recognized as the services are performed 
enrollment our enrollment division revenues are primarily generated from the sale of direct mail  interactive marketing and media placement services 
we derive other revenue from research services  admissions training  admissions shopper and retention services 
it is our practice to execute contracts or work orders for direct mail advertising campaigns  typically for up to three months in duration 
in most cases  individual direct mail projects take to business days to complete with payments due two days before marketing materials are mailed 
fees are determined based on the number of pieces mailed and the associated revenue is recognized when the marketing materials are mailed 
our pricing and revenue for direct mailings include all applicable postage costs 
interactive media arrangements usually range from three months to one year in duration 
our pricing is typically based on a fee per lead generated model  with an up front payment or deposit due at the time the customer s agreement is signed and monthly invoices thereafter based on the number of leads generated 
payments received are recorded as customer advances a liability until the leads are generated  at which point the revenue is recognized 
in  our enrollment division introduced a new  service fee based interactive product model under which the customer procures the lead and we provide lead scrubbing  media management  analytic and other services 
under these contracts  which typically have a duration of one year  datamark receives monthly fixed management fees  with opportunities for performance based bonuses 
fixed fees from these arrangements are recognized as revenue when services are provided  and incentive revenue is recognized as the incentives are earned 
we generally enter into master services agreements with larger clients for whom we provide media buying services 
we charge customers for the cost of the advertisement placed with the third party media supplier eg newspaper  television  radio station  etc 
as well as a commission for work performed 
revenue is recognized when the media advertisements are run by the third party media supplier 
revenue is recorded on a net basis  meaning that we include in our consolidated revenue only the commission portion of the amount we charge  not the gross amount of fees charged to  and collected from  our customers 
accordingly  we exclude the direct cost of the advertisement charged by the media supplier from our cost of revenues in our consolidated statements of operations 
other enrollment marketing revenue sources include retention services  admissions training  admissions shopper  research services and bundled lead generation and admissions services 
student retention services agreements have terms of not less than six months and typically are for a period of one year 
we charge a fee based on the number of students actively enrolled in a particular month  as well as a one time product implementation fee that is recognized as revenue over the contract period 
contracts for admissions training  admissions shopper and research services are negotiated based on scope of work 
these services are provided on an hourly or per project rate and revenues are recognized at the time of performance of the service or over the length of the service period 
datamark receives a percentage of tuition revenue per enrollment for its bundled lead generation and admissions services solution 
such revenues are recognized at the time leads are provided 
stock based compensation stock based compensation is a critical accounting policy for the company  due primarily to the significant judgment required when estimating the fair value of the stock based compensation awards  including the selection of a valuation method eg black scholes and the underlying assumptions within such valuation eg estimated lives outstanding and volatility 
during the fourth quarter of  we adopted statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
effective january  for our employee stock options and other employee stock based compensation arrangements using the prospective method under sfas no 
this method applies the provisions of sfas no 
to all employee stock awards granted  modified or settled after january   and accordingly  we have recognized compensation expense for such awards 
the fair values of restricted share rights are determined using the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant  while the fair values of stock options and stock purchase awards are estimated at the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the fair values of stock appreciation rights are estimated at the date of grant using a monte carlo simulation for an asian type award 
the estimated fair values of awards are being amortized over the vesting period of the applicable award  generally three to five years 
the company recorded million of stock based compensation expense in  million of stock based compensation expense in and million of stock based compensation expense in on september   the company granted stock appreciation rights with respect to million shares of common stock to executives and certain other key employees 
the rights were granted under the terms and conditions of the company s stock incentive plan  as amended and approved by stockholders 
the rights will be settled in common stock 
each grant is separated into five different levels of base prices to reflect minimum required levels of stockholder return over a five year performance period 
the base price for the first level is higher than the grant date stock price  and the base price for each successive level is higher than the previous level 
except in the case of a change in control of the company  as described below  a participant will receive a distribution with respect to the shares of common stock in each grant level only if the average closing price of our common stock for the last quarter in the five year term exceeds the base price for such shares 
each participant may elect to receive a distribution with respect to of the rights he or she was granted after the third anniversary of the grant and with respect to an additional after the fourth anniversary of the grant 
in the event of a change in control  participants will be entitled to receive a distribution with respect to a specified percentage of the shares granted if the change in control occurs on september   increasing by each month to on september   and will forfeit the right to receive a distribution with respect to the unvested portion of the shares 
the number of shares of common stock issued following a change in control will be based on the difference between the base prices and the share price as of the date the change in control occurs 
the fair value of each stock appreciation right was estimated on the date of grant using a monte carlo simulation for an asian type award 
on march   the company granted substantially the same recipients additional stock appreciation rights with respect to million shares of common stock 
on may   the company granted additional stock appreciation rights to an executive in connection with a promotion 
such grants have the same terms as the grants  including without limitation the same change in control vesting schedules  except that they have different base prices and new five year performance periods beginning on the grant dates 
in addition  the company may grant stock appreciation rights to new hires and in connection with promotions and other special circumstances 
compensation expense for each grant is recognized ratably over the five year performance period 
effective november   the company amended its employee stock purchase plan to revise certain features 
effective with the purchase interval that began on november   the ability of plan participants to increase contributions during an offering period was eliminated as was a reset feature that established a new offering period if the fair market value of the company s common stock on any purchase date within an offering period was less than the fair market value at the beginning of such offering period 
effective may   the length of an offering period was reduced from two years to one year and the length of each purchase interval was increased from six months to one year 
the employee stock purchase plan has been and continues to be accounted for under the fair value method in accordance with sfas no 
 which requires that compensation expense be recognized for the fair value of awards 
debt obligations in october  the company financed a portion of the purchase of datamark with million face value senior subordinated secured notes senior subordinated notes issued to a lender and million face value subordinated seller notes seller notes issued to the selling stockholders 
the senior subordinated notes require principal payments due in million quarterly increments beginning on december   with interest payments due quarterly beginning on december   at a rate of per annum 
the seller notes  with interest and principal due in  initially consisted of a series of notes aggregating million face value  with a stated interest rate of per annum  simple interest  and another series of notes aggregating million face value  with an interest rate of  interest compounded annually 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the company estimated the fair value of the senior subordinated notes and the seller notes 
the initial fair value of the senior subordinated notes reflected a fair value adjustment to the notes for the estimated fair value of the warrants issued in connection with this debt 
the estimated fair value of the warrants at the date of issuance  using the black scholes valuation method  was million  and was recorded as a debt discount against the face value of the million senior subordinated notes 
this discount is being amortized as interest expense over the five year term of the senior subordinated notes using the interest method 
the effective interest rate on this debt is 
the carrying value of the senior subordinated notes was million at december   which includes amortization of warrant costs 
the initial fair value of the seller notes was determined by a third party who considered  among other factors  the effective interest rate of our senior subordinated notes and other comparable debt securities 
the effective interest rate on this debt is 
in december the company repaid all of the million face value of simple interest notes and million face value of the annually compounding notes 
the carrying value of the repaid notes was million and the repayment resulted in a million charge for the write off of the unamortized discount on these notes 
the carrying value of the remaining seller notes was million at december   which includes amortization of the original discount recorded and accrued interest payable 
interest will accrue on the remaining notes until they are paid 
due to the discounts recorded when the senior subordinated notes and seller notes were issued  any further pre payments of these debt obligations would again result in a significant amount of interest expense  since cash paid would exceed the discounted carrying amount 
the senior subordinated notes also contain a provision that provides for the acceleration of all interest payments due through october  upon payment of the debt prior to maturity 
goodwill and other intangible assets with the acquisition of datamark in october  we recorded million of the approximate million purchase price as goodwill and other intangible assets 
significant judgment is required in establishing the fair value  determining appropriate amortization periods and assessing such intangibles for impairment 
in the future  we may determine that the carrying value of these intangibles exceeds their value  in which case we would be required to record an impairment charge which could be material 
goodwill represents the excess of the acquisition costs over the net of the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and the fair value of liabilities assumed in the acquisition 
we account for goodwill and other intangible assets under sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  whereby goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually 
the fair values of the intangible assets were recorded based upon valuations determined by a third party using the income and cost methods at the date of the acquisition 
the income method determines a value based upon estimated future cash flows and the cost method determines value based on what it would cost to replace the asset less depreciation and functional obsolescence 
based upon the nature of datamark s assets  the income approach was utilized to value the customer relationship intangible asset 
in performing the allocation  the assets were analyzed within the context of the datamark business enterprise 
the company considered this context to be representative of assumptions marketplace participants would use in analyzing the assets acquired 
in establishing the amortization period for the customer relationship intangible asset  the company considered the relative weighting of customer revenues and customer lives and determined that while certain customer relationships are expected to span as long as years  the economic benefit attributable to these customers generally declines in the final eight years as compared to the first eight years of the relationship 
therefore  the company used an eight year period weighted average for determining amortization 
during the life of a customer relationship  a customer s revenue streams can increase and decrease  creating a pattern of economic benefit that is not reliably determinable 
therefore  the company has determined that a straight line amortization method over eight years is appropriate and representative of the economic benefits of the intangible asset 
in determining the value of the datamark trade name  the company utilized the relief from royalty method using a royalty rate applied to projected datamark sales streams 
in determining that the trade name intangible asset had an indefinite life  the company considered the following factors the ongoing active useful life of the trade name  the lack of any legal  regulatory  or contractual provisions that may limit the useful life of the trade name  the lack of any substantial costs to maintain the asset  the positive impact on the trade name generated by datamark s other ongoing business activities  and datamark s commitment to products being branded with its trade name over its corporate history 
the datamark trade name has significant market recognition and the company expects to derive benefits from the use of this asset beyond the foreseeable future 
however  should the company discontinue use of or otherwise determine that the value of the trade name is diminished  the company may be required to record an impairment charge with respect to all or a significant portion of this asset 
pursuant to the datamark transaction  eight datamark employees signed agreements that legally restrict them from competing with ecollege during their respective employment periods and for two years therafter  provided that the total restricted period may not exceed five years 
in determining the value of the non compete agreements  the company estimated the incremental sales associated with having the non compete agreements in place versus not having them in place 
the company is amortizing the fair value of the non compete agreements over the maximum five year period 
certain factors that could affect the useful life of this asset include the termination of one or more of these employees  which could accelerate amortization if it would cause their non compete agreements to have lives of less than five years 
in april  a datamark executive resigned from the company  resulting in the acceleration of the amortization of the fair value of his non compete agreement to correspond with the resulting decrease in the term of his agreement 
goodwill and identified intangible assets with indefinite lives goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized 
the company reviews goodwill and identified intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
the goodwill impairment review is performed using a two step impairment test 
the first phase screens for impairment  while the second phase if necessary  measures the impairment 
for purposes of this test we have identified two reporting units  which are the same as our reportable segments see note 
in the first step of the goodwill analysis  the company compares the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  the second step must be completed to determine the amount impaired 
in the second step  the company compares the carrying value to the implied fair value of the goodwill under a theoretical purchase allocation scenario 
the impairment review of the identified intangible assets with indefinite lives consists of a comparison of the fair value of an intangible asset with its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to such excess 
after an impairment loss is recognized  the adjusted carrying amount of the intangible asset is its new accounting basis 
impairment tests completed in the years ended december  and indicated no impairment of either goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite lives 
software development costs the company s activities include ongoing development of internal use software used in connection with delivery of services via our proprietary software platform and network 
pursuant to the provisions of the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa s statement of position  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use  costs incurred during the application development stage are capitalized and costs incurred during the preliminary project and post implementation stages are expensed as incurred 
capitalized software development costs are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives  generally three years 
capitalized software development costs for the years ended december   and were million  million and  respectively 
amortization begins when the products are ready for their intended use 
amortization expense for the years ended december   and was   and million  respectively 
if the internal use software developed is determined to have a reduced life or is otherwise abandoned or impaired  amortization could be accelerated or a write off of the asset could result 
income taxes income taxes consist of federal  state and local taxes 
accounting for income taxes and any related valuation allowance requires the application of significant judgment and estimates 
we incurred significant tax losses from our inception through december  resulting in approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards which expire in varying amounts beginning in the company was profitable in the years ended december  and and has used net operating loss carryforwards to reduce income taxes payable during such periods 
as of december   net operating loss carryforwards of million remained 
however  utilization of such net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to certain limitations  such as limitations resulting from significant changes in ownership 
in addition  income taxes may be payable during this time  due to operating income in certain tax jurisdictions which cannot be offset by operating loss carryforwards 
if we have taxable income and the net operating loss carryforwards are not available  because they have been limited by tax law  have been exhausted or have expired  we may be liable for significant taxes payable 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences  as determined pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  become deductible 
management considers the reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
management s evaluation of the realizability of deferred tax assets must consider both positive and negative evidence 
the weight given to the potential effects of positive and negative evidence is based on the extent to which it can be objectively verified 
prior to the fourth quarter of  we had provided a full valuation allowance for the potential benefits of the aforementioned net operating loss carryforwards as we believed it was more likely than not that the benefits would not be realized 
during the fourth quarter of  we reversed million of the valuation allowance related to the net operating loss carryforwards and other temporary items as we determined it was now more likely than not that we would be able to use the assets to reduce future tax liabilities 
approximately  in valuation reserves associated with state net operating loss carryforwards were not reversed in the fourth quarter of as we determined that it was more likely than not that the benefits of such carryforwards would not be realized 
the reversal resulted in recognition of an income tax benefit of million in and an increase in the deferred tax asset on the consolidated balance sheet 
the reversal also resulted in an increase of million to additional paid in capital associated with tax benefits from stock based compensation and an increase of  to goodwill associated with certain tax benefits related to the datamark acquisition 
we recorded income tax expense of million for the year ended december  in  the company recorded a million increase to additional paid in capital related to tax benefits associated with stock based compensation  including million related to the exercise of  options held by blumenstein thorne information partners i  lp  an investment fund affiliated with the company s chief executive officer 
the company recorded a  reduction to goodwill during associated with tax benefits related to the datamark acquisition

other components include rent  depreciation  communications  insurance and professional and consulting fees  including fees relating to the audit of our financial statements and our compliance with sarbanes oxley 
amortization of intangible assets our amortization of intangible assets consists entirely of the amortization of identified intangible assets that we recorded in connection with the datamark acquisition 
specifically  customer relationships are amortized over their estimated useful lives of eight years and non compete agreements are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of five years 
in april  a datamark executive resigned from the company  resulting in the acceleration of the amortization of the fair value of his non compete agreement to correspond with the decrease in the term of his non compete 
the datamark trade name has been deemed to have an indefinite life and is not subject to amortization expense 
other income expense  net other income expense  net consists primarily of interest expense associated with our various debt obligations  as well as interest income from invested cash and cash equivalents 
results of operations the following discussion compares the historical results of operations for the years ended december    and the results for include the enrollment division s results of operations from october   the date on which we acquired all of the outstanding stock of datamark  inc the inclusion of the enrollment division s results for  and the two months ended december  caused significant fluctuations in the operating results of ecollege for the years shown 
in addition  operating results for the enrollment division may vary significantly from quarter to quarter based upon various factors that include the timing of start dates for customers courses and programs and their associated enrollment marketing expenditures 
years ended december  and revenue 
revenue increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the enrollment division was responsible for million of this increase  primarily due to a million increase in revenue from bundled lead generation and admissions services  offset in part by a  decrease in revenue from direct mail marketing services 
the elearning division contributed million of the increase  primarily due to a million increase in student fees from online courses 
at the elearning division  student fees represented million and million of total revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively  an increase of million  or 
our elearning customers benefit from volume discounts on their student technology fees based on the success of their distance programs 
in addition  they often guarantee a minimum amount of student technology fees for each year they are under contract with us  for which they receive further discounts on our services 
therefore  the increase in our student fee revenue was not directly proportional to the increase in our customers online student enrollments 
student enrollments in ecourses increased to  in from  in the prior year  while the corresponding revenue earned from ecourse enrollments increased to million in from million in the and enrollment numbers are not directly comparable because includes approximately  enrollments in short term faculty training courses that generated significantly less revenue per enrollment than other ecourses 
we expect the trend of distance enrollment growth outpacing associated revenue growth to continue in campus and course development fees represented million and million of total revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively  a decrease of  or 
the decrease is primarily the result of a decline in course development and course maintenance revenue attributable to an increasing number of customers taking advantage of our products and tools to design and develop their own courses 
other elearning revenue increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase is primarily attributable to a greater demand for our technical and academic consulting services during as compared to  especially by new customers adopting elearning s technology platform 
with respect to our enrollment division  revenue from direct mail marketing activities was million and million  respectively  for the years ended december  and  a decrease of  or 
the decrease resulted primarily from a shift by several existing customers from direct mail marketing to interactive lead generation  offset in part by increased sales of direct marketing services to other existing customers as well as new customers 
direct mail accounted for of enrollment division revenue for the year ended december  compared to of enrollment division revenue for the year ended december  revenue from interactive marketing services increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   due primarily to increased acceptance of the internet as a vehicle for lead generation 
this increase in interactive marketing revenue was a reason for the decrease in direct mail revenue as a percentage of enrollment division total revenue  as interactive marketing revenue growth exceeded direct mail revenue growth 
interactive growth for the year ended december  was also impacted by the introduction in of a managed services pricing structure 
as compared to the traditional cost per lead model  the managed services model generates less revenue because inventory costs of interactive leads are not passed through to customers 
managed services pricing accounted for of interactive revenues for the year ended december  interactive marketing in total accounted for of total enrollment division revenue for the year ended december  as compared to for the prior year period 
media placement revenue remained relatively flat at million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  other enrollment marketing revenue increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase consisted primarily of revenue from a bundled lead generation admissions solution provided by datamark to a customer beginning in the fourth quarter of under this relationship  revenues are recognized upon the delivery of leads following enrollment marketing programs and additional enrollment services specific to the customer s degree programs 
datamark receives a share of program tuition for each enrollment 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue for the year ended december  increased by million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  the enrollment division s cost of revenue was million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  from million for the year ended december  the enrollment division s cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue remained relatively flat at in as compared to in the cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue is affected by reduced margins in direct mail  shifts in product mix from direct mail to interactive marketing  improved margins for our interactive business due to automation and the introduction of a new managed services pricing model  as well as the timing of revenues related to bundled lead generation and admissions services 
the elearning division s cost of revenue increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenue  elearning cost of revenue increased from for the period to for the period 
the increase as a percentage of revenue is attributable to a million increase in salaries for information technology  professional services  and client services employees  software licensing costs  and the write off of third party software no longer in use 
corporate cost of revenue remained relatively flat at  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  gross profit 
we realized gross profit of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  resulting in a or million increase 
the enrollment division contributed million to our gross profit for the year ended december   up from million for the year ended december  the increase of million primarily related to the increase in interactive revenue somewhat offset by a decrease in direct mail revenue 
the elearning division contributed million to our gross profit for the year ended december   up from million for the year ended december  the increase of resulted from the increase in our higher margin student fee revenue 
product development 
including the impact of capitalized software development costs  product development expenses increased  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase results primarily from a reduction in the amount of capitalized software development  an increase in our offshore development efforts in sri lanka and an increase in personnel costs 
for the years ended december  and  capitalized software development costs were and million  respectively  a decrease of  or 
the decrease results primarily from the completion and release into production of development projects in process during the prior year 
we continue to focus our efforts on increasing the functionality of all products and the development of new product lines that enhance our current offerings 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses increased by  to million for the year ended december   up from million for the year ended december  the enrollment division incurred million of selling and marketing expenses for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   and the elearning division s selling and marketing expenses decreased by  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the modest decrease resulted from reductions in new business development expenses and general marketing expenses 
corporate selling and marketing expenses were  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  an increase of  or  due primarily to payroll related charges 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased by  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  a  decrease in corporate general and administrative expenses was offset by increased payroll expense associated with increased staffing at both the elearning and datamark divisions 
the decrease in corporate expenses resulted from a  decrease in bonuses paid under the ecollege bonus plan  a million decrease in stock based compensation related to our employee stock purchase plan espp and a  decrease in consulting costs associated with sarbanes oxley compliance 
these decreases were offset by a million increase in stock based compensation associated with stock appreciation rights  a  increase in external audit fees and increased tax consulting and legal fees 
corporate payroll expenses increased by  due to staffing of the chicago office 
we record non cash stock based compensation expense in connection with the grant of stock options  stock awards under our espp  stock appreciation rights and restricted share rights to employees  officers  and directors in accordance with sfas  which we adopted january  the deferred charges are amortized over the relevant vesting periods of such awards  which range from one to five years 
we recorded million of stock based compensation in the year ended december   a decrease of million from the million recorded in the year ended december  the decrease results from a million reduction in stock based compensation expense following the terminations of employment of three datamark management employees and the forfeiture of their unvested equity compensation 
such reduction includes  from the reversal of previously recognized stock based compensation expense and  resulting from the elimination of expense for the periods following the terminations 
expenses associated with stock appreciation rights increased by million and expenses associated with the espp decreased by million 
a portion of the company s non cash stock based compensation expense was allocated to cost of revenue  selling and marketing expense and product development expense  as appropriate  based on the recipients of the awards  however  the majority of the stock based compensation expense relates to our executive team and was therefore included in general and administrative expense 
amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
amortization of intangible assets consists entirely of the amortization of identified intangible assets which we recorded in connection with the datamark acquisition 
specifically  customer relationships with an estimated value of million are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of eight years  and non compete agreements valued at million are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of five years 
in april  a datamark executive resigned from the company  resulting in the acceleration of the amortization of the fair value of his non compete agreement to correspond with the decrease in the term of the agreement 
beginning in the second quarter of  such amortization increased by approximately  per quarter

income taxes 
income tax expense increased by million  to million for the year ended december  from a tax benefit of million for the year ended december  the increase is due to our increasing profitability and our conclusion that it is more likely than not that the company will realize the tax benefits associated with deferred tax assets created by net operating loss carryforwards 
prior to this conclusion  and the resulting recognition of deferred tax assets relating to net operating loss carryforwards  income tax expense was offset by equivalent reductions in the valuation reserve against the deferred tax asset

student fees represented million and million of total revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively  an increase of 
our elearning customers benefit from volume discounts on their student technology fees based on the success of their distance programs 
in addition  they often guarantee a minimum amount of student technology fees for each year they are under contract with us  for which they receive further discounts on our services 
therefore  the increase in our student fee revenue was not directly proportional to the increase in our customers online student enrollments in student enrollments in ecourses increased to  in from  in the prior year  while the corresponding revenue earned from ecourse enrollments increased to million in from million in the and enrollment numbers are not directly comparable because includes approximately  enrollments in short term faculty training courses that generated significantly less revenue per enrollment than other ecourses offered

other factors contributing to the increase in from included increases in general corporate expenses such as bonuses million  sarbanes oxley compliance million  audit fees and higher stock based compensation 
these increased costs were offset somewhat by a decrease in information systems costs 
we record non cash stock based compensation in connection with the grant of stock options  stock awards under our espp  stock appreciation rights and restricted share rights to employees  officers  and directors in accordance with sfas  which we adopted using the prospective method  effective january  the deferred charges are being amortized over the relevant vesting periods of such options or restricted share rights  which range from one to five years 
we recorded million of stock based compensation in the year ended december  and million in the year ended december  a portion of such compensation expense was allocated to cost of revenue  selling and marketing expense  and product development expense  as appropriate  based on the recipients of the awards  however  the majority of the stock based compensation expense relates to our executive team and was therefore included in general and administrative expense

elearning division year ended december  in thousands  except percentages net revenue income from operations income from operations as a percentage of net revenue elearning revenue grew in and in from the prior year 
the increase in revenue for both years is primarily due to an increase in the number of student enrollments in online courses 
our customers offer traditional  as well as quarterly  bi monthly and monthly course terms to their students and we typically host more courses during the spring academic term than in the summer or fall terms 
as a result  consecutive academic term enrollment results are not directly comparable 
the following table presents the number of student enrollments our customers had start in distance courses during the   and spring  summer and fall academic terms 
distance course enrollments academic term spring january may summer may august fall august december total student enrollments for a more detailed explanation of revenue components and the growth trends of the elearning division revenue  please see the information under the caption results of operations earlier in this item the elearning division s income from operations increased by million between and and by million between and the increase was primarily due to increased student fees  which have a relatively higher contribution margin than most of our other revenue sources 
in addition  non allocable corporate general and administrative expenses were excluded from elearning s segment results in and in  elearning results included these corporate expenses  as the enrollment division had only two months of operations in enrollment division year ended december  in thousands  except percentages net revenue income loss from operations income loss from operations as a percentage of net revenue as datamark was acquired on october   the preceding results only show activity for the the years ended december  and and the last two months of during the ten months ended october  prior to our acquisition of datamark  datamark s revenue was million and its income from operations was million

as a part of the master debt agreement with the bank that provided the term loan  the company also obtained a million revolving line of credit  the prior revolver which matured on october  the prior revolver replaced a previous revolving line of credit 
the interest rate on the prior revolver was equal to the bank s prime rate plus but not less than in october  the company restructured its bank credit facility and obtained a million revolving line of credit the new revolver that matures on october  the interest rate on the new revolver is equal to the bank s prime rate at december

however  if at the time of exercise of all or any portion of the warrants  the trading price of the company s common stock is less than per share for the thirty trading days immediately preceding the date of such exercise  then the exercise price shall be automatically adjusted such that the exercise price will be equal to per share with respect to such exercise 
the warrants expire on october  the net proceeds received in connection with the issuance of the senior subordinated notes totaled million  which was allocated to the senior subordinated notes and the warrants 
the company allocated million to the warrants based upon the fair value of the warrants  which was estimated using the black scholes option pricing model  a risk free interest rate of  volatility of  dividend yield  and an expected life of five years the contractual life of the warrants 
the remaining million was allocated to the senior subordinated notes

the effective interest rate on these notes  including the amortization of the recorded discount  is 
the fair value of the seller notes was determined by a third party who considered  among other factors  the effective interest rate of the senior subordinated notes and other comparable debt securities 
due to the discounts on the senior subordinated notes and seller notes  any payment of these debt obligations prior to their maturity results in additional interest expense due to the realization of the unamortized portions of the costs and discounts recorded 
the early repayment of million carrying value million face value of seller notes during the fourth quarter of resulted in an additional million interest charge 
the remaining balance of the seller notes was million at december   with an unamortized discount of  and accrued interest payable of we expect our current cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments  together with cash generated from operations  to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months

the company maintains two letters of credit with the bank in the amounts of  and  under which the vendor of the company s back up computer systems and the landlord for the company s denver facility are the respective beneficiaries 
the letters of credit effectively reduce the borrowing ability under the new revolver by  recent accounting pronouncements on december   the fasb issued fasb statement no 
revised share based payment sfas r  which is a revision of sfas sfas r supersedes apb no 
 and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally the approach in sfas r is similar to the approach described in sfas however  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative following the adoption of sfas r 
the company is in the process of evaluating the impact of sfas r on its consolidated financial statements 
the company does not expect that the adoption of sfas r will have a material impact on its financial statements 
sfas r must be adopted no later than the beginning of the first fiscal year following june   therefore we are required to adopt sfas r for the year beginning january  we intend to use the modified prospective method 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting changes and error corrections sfas no 
 which will require entities that voluntarily make a change in an accounting principle to apply that change retrospectively to prior periods financial statements  unless such retrospective application would be impracticable 
sfas no 
supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting changes apb no 
 which previously required that most voluntary changes in accounting principle be recognized by including in the current period s net income the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle 
sfas no 
also makes a distinction between retrospective application of an accounting principle and the restatement of financial statements to reflect the correction of an error 
another significant change in practice under sfas no 
will be the requirement that if an entity changes its method of depreciation  amortization  or depletion for long lived  non financial assets  the change must be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate 
under apb no 
 such a change would have been reported as a change in accounting principle 
sfas no 
applies to accounting changes and error corrections that are made in fiscal years beginning after december  and will have an effect on the company to the extent the company makes an accounting change or corrects an error 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position  operating results or cash flows due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 
the company is  or may become  exposed to market risk in the areas of changes in united states interest rates and changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the united states dollar 
these exposures are directly related to our normal operating and funding activities 
historically  and as of december   we have not used derivative instruments or engaged in hedging activities 
the company does not have significant exposure to changing interest rates that would impact its cash balance which was million at december  our short term investment portfolio is managed in accordance with our investment policy  which allows us to invest in investment securities of less than one year in maturity including money market accounts  certificates of deposit  investment grade commercial paper  united states government debt obligations and other securities guaranteed by or carrying the implied guarantee of the united states government 
since october  substantially all of our available cash has been invested in money market accounts 
as a result  the interest rate market risk implicit in these investments at december   is low 
however  factors influencing the financial condition of security issuers may impact their ability to meet their financial obligations and could impact the realizability of our security portfolio 
a hypothetical ten percent change in market interest rates over the next year would not have a material effect on the fair value of the company s debt instruments or our cash equivalent  nor would it materially impact the earnings or cash flow associated with our cash investments 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k for further information on the fair value of the company s financial instruments 
although our revolving line of credit bears interest at an adjustable rate equal to the prime rate  a hypothetical ten percent change in the market rates as of december  would not have a material effect on our earnings and cash flows in  because we expect drawings on our line of credit during  if any  to be for short term working capital needs
