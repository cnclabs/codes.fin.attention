item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview over the past twenty two years  implant sciences corporation has both developed and acquired technologies using ion implantation and thin film coatings 
initially this technology was used in semiconductor processing but soon expanded to include various medical device applications including the modification of orthopedic joint implant surfaces to reduce polyethylene wear generation and the manufacture of products for radiation therapy treatments 
our latest application of this technology includes the manufacturing of trace explosives detection equipment 
we currently provide ion implantation and analytical services to numerous semiconductor manufacturers  research laboratories and universities 
the application of our ion implantation technologies to modify the surfaces of orthopedic joint implants is being applied primarily to product manufactured by the stryker orthopaedics division of stryker corporation 
in october and march  we acquired two california semiconductor companies 
through these acquisitions  we have more than doubled our semiconductor capacity and are now able to offer diagnostic services and semiconductor equipment refurbishment services to semiconductor manufacturers  research laboratories and universities 
other applications of our ion beam technology have been in the area of temporary brachytherapy products 
in may  we received food and drug administration k clearance to market our i plant tm iodine radioactive seed for the treatment of prostate cancer and in recognized our first sale 
since may  we have been performing research to develop a trace explosives detector  which could be used to detect hidden bombs in airports and other public places 
this technology is yet another application of our ion source technology 
at present  we have developed both portable and bench top systems for use in airports and department of defense facilities and have successfully marketed these products both domestically and internationally 
in fiscal  as part of a plan to reduce manufacturing costs  we transitioned the production of these products to a contract manufacturer 
as we continue to sell and deliver these products  we work both independently and in conjunction with various government agencies  to develop the next generation of trace explosives detectors and identify new applications for our proprietary technology 
on october   the company acquired core systems incorporated core and on march   the company acquired accurel systems international corporation accurel 
the results of operations  of the acquired companies  are part of the company s semiconductor business segment 
the results of operations for the acquired companies are included in the company s results of operations since the date of their respective acquisition 
as such  the results of operations for the years ended june  and are not comparable 
on or about march   the company commenced an arbitration under the rules of the american arbitration association against respondents majid ghafghaichi majid and vahe sarkissisian vahe  seeking a total of  for indemnification of various losses  as defined in  and expressly allowed pursuant to  a stock purchase agreement dated march  the agreement  between the company  as the purchaser  accurel systems international corporation accurel  and majid and vahe  as the sellers of of the issued and outstanding shares of accurel stock 
more specifically  there are four claims asserted by the company against respondents damages of million resulting from misrepresentations concerning the loss of business from a key accurel customer  unauthorized withdrawals in the amount of approximately  from accurel by the respondents prior to the closing  approximately  of disallowed transaction expenses that the respondents improperly received  and undisclosed net liabilities totaling approximately  respondents have asserted counterclaims seeking an aggregate amount in excess of  based on the allegedly late payment to respondents of company stock and a secured promissory note as part of the consideration for their sale of accurel stock 
the company has filed a detailed denial of all counterclaims 
the arbitration is now in the discovery phase  and the hearings are scheduled for february  at this early stage of the proceedings  particularly before the commencement of depositions  it is difficult to assess the final outcome of this arbitration 
however  the company believes that the counterclaims have no merit  and will vigorously defend such counterclaimson march   the company entered into a development  distribution and manufacturing agreement with rapiscan systems the rapiscan agreement 
the rapiscan agreement provides for the manufacture and sale of the company s existing explosives detection equipment on a private label basis  the funding by rapiscan of up to  for the development of a trace explosives detection subsystem to be integrated with rapiscan s x ray baggage screening device technology  and up to  for the development of other trace explosives detection subsystems 
the rapiscan agreement includes various manufacturing  selling and distribution rights 
on march   the company brought suit in the united states district court in the district of massachusetts against rapiscan and its parent  osi systems  inc osi 
the company is requesting rescission of the rapiscan agreement  for lack of performance and other grounds 
in the alternative  the company is seeking termination of the rapiscan agreement due to material breaches of contract and implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and for damages due to rapiscan s breach of contract and the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing 
on march   the company received notice that rapiscan filed a complaint against the company and its contract manufacturer  columbia tech  in the united states district court for the central district of california  regarding the rapiscan agreement 
rapiscan s complaint against the company is based upon claims of breach of contract and breach of warranty and is requesting a decree for specific performance  declaratory relief and injunctive relief 
rapiscan s complaint against columbia tech is based upon injunctive relief  declaratory relief and tortuous interference with contractual relations 
on april   rapiscan dismissed all claims against columbia tech 
as of august   as a result of motions made by both parties  the two lawsuits have been consolidated in the united states district court for the central district of california with the company as plaintiff 
presently  discovery is in process 
rapiscan and osi have filed a motion to dismiss certain of the company s claims 
the company has not yet responded to the motion 
it is expected that the court will hear and rule on the motion in october should the company be unsuccessful in prosecuting this matter  it may have a material adverse affect on its business and results of operations 
the company manages its business and reports results from operations for three business segments medical  which includes radioactive seeds  orthopedic coatings  medical related government contracts and other related activities  security products  which includes development contracts and product sales related to the company s trace explosives detection products  and semiconductor  which includes ion implantation  disk refurbishment  source conditioning equipment and semiconductor analytical services 
results of operations the following is a discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operation of the company for the years ended june   and it should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere herein 
revenues 
total revenues for the year ended june  were  as compared to  and  for the prior year periods ended june  and  respectively 
our revenues by business segment are as follows june  medical semiconductor security total june  medical semiconductor security total june  medical semiconductor security total revenues for the year ended june  were  as compared to  in the year ended june   an increase of  or 
the increase came from all three of our business segments 
our semiconductor business segment increased  or  our security products previously referred to as explosives detection business segment increased  or and our medical business segment increased  or 
fiscal was the first year that revenues from core and accurel were included for the full fiscal year 
core was acquired on october  and accurel was acquired on march  fiscal results included revenues only from the respective dates of acquisition 
core and accurel revenues in the year ended june  were  as compared with  for the comparative prior year period  accounting for  of the increase in revenues 
the increase in security products revenue is primarily attributable to the first significant commercial quantities of our hand held explosives detection devices being sold in fiscal and from the performance of a significant government contract granted by the transportation security administration 
in addition  included in the fiscal results was  of security product revenues previously deferred from fiscal  pending final customer acceptance 
the increase in our medical business segment is primarily from our seeds business 
revenue from seeds and treatment planning systems increased  in the year ended june  over the previous year 
total revenues for the year ended june  were  as compared to  in the year ended june  an increase of  or 
the increase is primarily attributable to revenues from core and accurel since their acquisitions on october  and march  respectively  results from core and accurel were not included in the previous year 
revenues from core and accurel totaled approximately  for the year ended june  and for the year ended june  core and accurel are included in our semiconductor segment 
revenues for the year ended june  from the company s security products business declined to  as compared to  for the comparable prior year  a decrease of  or 
this decrease is attributable to the completion of certain government contracts 
security product contract revenues were  and  for the years ended june  and  respectively 
the company has been transitioning the security products business from primarily a contracts development business to a product sales business 
to that extent we have established strategic sales and distribution relationships both domestically and internationally 
for the year ended june   the company had deferred  of security product revenues  pending final customer acceptance 
revenues for the medical business unit were  for the year ended june  as compared to  for the year ended june   a decrease of  or 
seeds revenues were  as compared to  for the prior year  a decrease of  or 
the decrease in revenues from seeds was primarily due from a pattern of decreasing volumes that started last year 
management believes the seed volumes have stabilized and are taking steps to achieve higher seed volumes in the coming year  including the benefits of selling our treatment planning software to our customers 
revenues from medical and industrial coatings were  as compared to  for the prior year  an increase of  or 
while revenue from orthopedic related coatings remains virtually unchanged from the prior year period  we recognized a  or nearly increase  in our non orthopedic related medical coatings 
this increase was related to certain new customers transitioning from research and development projects to the beginning stages of production 
we expect to see continued growth in this area 
medical contract sales decreased  to  as compared to  in the prior year due to the completion of certain contracts 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues for the year ended june  was  as compared to  and  for the prior year periods ended june  and  respectively 
the cost of revenues by business segment is as follows year ended june  medical semiconductor security total year ended june  medical semiconductor security total year ended june  medical semiconductor security total total cost of revenues for the year ended june  were  as compared to  for the prior year period  an increase of  or 
cost of revenues for our semiconductor business segment was  for the year ended june  as compared to  for the prior year period an increase of  or 
fiscal year was the first year that the results of core and accurel were included in our operations for a full fiscal year 
core was acquired on october  and accurel was acquired on march  cost of revenues for core and accurel were  for the year ended june  as compared to  for the prior year  an increase of  or 
cost of revenues for our security products segment was  for the year ended june  as compared to  for the prior year period 
most of the increase is attributable to materials and manufacturing costs associated with the sales of our hand held explosives detection devices 
the cost of revenues for the year ended june  was  as compared to  for the prior year period ended june  the overall increase in cost of revenues is primarily a result of costs attributable to core and accurel since their acquisition on october  and march   respectively 
cost of revenues at core and accurel totaled  as compared to in the prior year period 
core and accurel are included in our semiconductor segment 
in addition  our cost of revenues also increased due to our efforts to ramp up our security product manufacturing capability as we transition from primarily contract revenues to higher volumes of product sales related to the security product business segment 
the cost of our security product revenues were  compared to  in the prior year  an increase of  or 
during the year ended june   we wrote off  to cost of revenues  of equipment  that was determined by management  to have no future value 
this equipment was originally purchased or built for very specific applications or technologies that in management s judgment no longer justify additional expenditure and no other use for this equipment exists 
most of the equipment write offs were attributable to the medical segment 
gross margins year ended june  medical semiconductor security total sales cos margin year ended june  medical semiconductor security total sales cos margin year ended june  medical semiconductor security total sales cos margin overall gross margins were of revenues in the year ended june  as compared to in the prior year 
the increase in gross margins comes from all of our business segments 
semiconductor gross margins were for the year ended june  as compared to for the prior year period 
this improvement is primarily due to the inclusion of accurel for the entire year in our fiscal accurel is a service business and is characterized by relatively low variable costs so increased revenues beyond the level needed to cover fixed costs will have a significant impact on gross margins 
security products gross margins were for the year ended june  as compared to a gross margin loss of in the prior year period 
the improvement in security products margin is due to the manufacturing and sale of handheld trace explosives detection devices which covered the cost of our manufacturing organization built during the prior year 
once the initial handheld explosives detector production run was completed  and the manufacturing process was proven  manufacturing was transitioned to a contract manufacturer allowing the company to reduce its manufacturing overhead 
the medical segment gross margins were for the year ended june  compared to for the prior year period 
the improvement in gross margin came from manufacturing efficiencies gained in our seeds operations primarily from increased volumes and cost reductions 
overall gross margins were of revenues in the year ended june  as compared to of revenues in the period ended june  the decrease in the gross margin percentage is attributable to relatively high fixed costs in our medical products segment that cannot be easily adjusted for the decrease in revenues  which the company experienced 
medical segment gross margins were  or of revenues  for the year ended june  as compared to  or of revenues  for the prior year period 
in addition  the transition from contract development work in the security product segment created a situation in which the company had declining revenues due to completion of major contracts  at the same time the company was building its product manufacturing capability 
the result of this transition was a gross margin loss of  or  of sales for the security product segment  for the year ended june  as compared to gross margins of  or  in the prior year period 
semiconductor margins were of revenues as compared to a gross margin loss of in the prior year period 
this turnaround is attributable to accurel since its acquisition by the company on march  research and development 
research and development expense for the year ended june  was  as compared to  for the comparable prior year period  a decrease of  or 
these expenses include  and  of stock based compensation expense  respectively 
the decrease in research and development expenses relates to the increase in customer funded programs  primarily through government grants and contracts  performed in fiscal the company charges its research and development personnel to cost of revenues for work performed on these contracts and grants 
a total of  of research and development personnel costs were charged to cost of sales in the year ended june  as compared to  in the prior year period 
in addition other costs associated with unfunded research and development projects in the prior fiscal year were expensed to research and development 
research and development expense for the year ended june  was  as compared to  for the comparable prior year period ended june   an increase of  or 
these expenses include  and  of stock based compensation expense  respectively 
the company continued to expend funds to further the development of new products in the areas of explosives and toxic substance detection and temporary brachytherapy areas 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense for the year ended june  was  as compared to  for the comparable prior year period  an increase of  or 
this increase is primarily related to  of additional selling  general and administrative expenses incurred due to the inclusion of core and accurel for the full twelve month period in fiscal core and accurel were acquired on october  and march   respectively  and the prior year includes their costs from the day of acquisition 
selling  general and administrative also included  of share based compensation  measured at fair value  due to the adoption of sfas r accounting for stock based compensation sfas r in fiscal as compared to  of non cash stock based compensation in the prior year period measured at fair value 
during the year ended june  we also recorded a  impairment charge to write down goodwill associated with the acquisition of core 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended june  was  as compared to  for the comparable prior year period ended june   an increase of  or 
this increase is primarily related to  of additional selling  general and administrative expenses incurred since the acquisition of core systems and accurel systems on october  and march   combined with increased spending for legal  accounting and consulting services 
this increase was offset by a  or reduction of non cash  stock based compensation  to  in the twelve month period ending june   as compared with  during the twelve month period ended june  additional increases in selling  general and administrative expenses included an increase of  related to salaries and employee related expenses  reflecting new hires during the year  an increase in rent expense of  due to expansion of floor space and  an increase in audit and tax fees of  other income and expenses  net 
for the year ended june   we recorded other expense  net  of  as compared to  in the comparable prior year period an increase of  or 
other income and expense includes a loss of  representing the company s share of losses attributable to its investment in cornova  an unconsolidated subsidiary accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
other income and expense also includes a  gain due to the change in the value of the embedded derivatives associated with the series d redeemable convertible preferred stock  since its issuance on september   and a loss on the modification of the series d redeemable convertible preferred stock  accounted for as an extinguishment of debt under eitf of for the year ended june   we recorded other expense  net  of  as compared to  in the period ended june  net loss 
net loss for the year ended june  was  as compared with  for the comparable prior year period  a decrease in net loss of  or 
the decrease in net loss is primarily due to reduced loss from operations of  offset by an increase in other expenses of  the fiscal net loss includes  of sfas r share based compensation and other non cash compensation compared to  of non cash compensation in the prior year period 
the company adopted fasr in the current fiscal year using the modified prospective method 
these additional expenses were offset by improved results from the semiconductor and security product segments 
preferred distribution  dividends and accretion on series d redeemable convertible preferred stock were  in the year ended june  as compared to  in the year ended june  the company issued series d redeemable convertible preferred stock on september  all previous issues of preferred stock had been converted to common in the prior year period 
net loss for the year ended june  was  as compared with  for the prior year period ended june   an increase in net loss of  or 
the increase in net loss is primarily due to losses in the security products segment due to the completion of certain government contracts early in the year and costs related to increasing our manufacturing capability ahead of expected product orders 
preferred distribution  dividends and accretion on series d redeemable convertible preferred stock were  in the year ended june  as compared to  in the year ended june  this decrease is attributable to the conversion of preferred stock to common stock during the periods shown 
all outstanding preferred stock had been converted as of june  liquidity and capital resources year ended june  cash and cash equivalents cash used by operating activities cash used in investing activities cash provided by financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents as of june   the company had approximately  in the form of cash and cash equivalents 
during the year ended june   operating activities used cash of approximately  net cash used by operating activities primarily reflects the  net loss  increased by a non cash gain of  related to the change in fair value of derivatives  and reduced by non cash charges of offset by  in depreciation and amortization   of non cash compensation expense   loss on the extinguishment of series d  and  in other non cash charges to operations 
in addition the company invested  in inventory  accounts receivable and other current assets while paying down liabilities by  during the year ended june   investing activities used cash of approximately  which was primarily for equipment and other fixed assets 
during the year ended june   financing activities provided approximately  in cash 
net cash provided by financing activities primarily includes net proceeds from the issuance of series d redeemable convertible preferred stock of  and  from a revolving credit facility with a bank 
net cash provided by financing was offset by payments on our debt of  which includes the payoff of a  short term note associated with the acquisition of accurel 
as of june   the company had approximately  in the form of cash and cash equivalents 
during the year ended june   operating activities used cash of approximately  net cash used by operating activities primarily reflects the  net loss offset by  in depreciation and other non cash expenses 
in addition the company invested  in inventory as it begins its production of the trace explosives detection product and paid down its liability to med tec by  the company realized cash of  by lowering its accounts receivables due to timely payments from government contracts and  from reduced prepaid expenses 
accounts payables and accruals increased  reflecting the increase in operating activities 
cash flows from deferred revenues increased by  primarily due to payments received by the company  for products and services not recognized by the company as revenues  until final acceptance by the customer 
during the year ended june   investing activities used cash of approximately  which was primarily attributable to  used in the acquisition of core and accurel offset by  realized from the sale of acquired assets 
during the year ended june   financing activities provided approximately  in cash 
net cash provided by financing activities primarily includes net proceeds from a private placement of  and  from the exercise of options and warrants 
net cash provided by financing was offset by payments on our long term debt of  including  of debt paid off by the company associated with the acquired assets that were sold on july   the company executed a million secured term note payable to laurus master fund  ltd 
laurus 
the company received  in gross proceeds  less a management fee of  and related transaction costs of approximately  the term note was collateralized by substantially all of the company s assets  had a month term and bore interest at a rate equal to the prime rate plus once percent 
in connection with the financing  on september   the company issued laurus a warrant to purchase up to  shares of the company s common stock at a price equal to per share 
the warrants were valued using the black scholes model and the following assumptions volatility of  expected life of years and a risk free interest rate of 
net proceeds from the financing were used for increasing the capacity of the quantum sniffer production line  increasing unit inventories and the repayment of certain indebtedness due and owed by the company to the former shareholders of accurel in connection with the acquisition of this wholly owned subsidiary 
on september   the company issued  shares of series d convertible redeemable preferred stock series d having a stated value of per share  pursuant to a securities purchase agreement with laurus 
the company received  in gross proceeds  less a management and placement agent fee of approximately  and related transaction costs of approximately  the company utilized the proceeds to repay the million term note with laurus signed on july  the series d has a dividend equal to the prime rate plus one percent at june  and provides for redemption over a thirty six month period pursuant to an amortization schedule 
the monthly redemption amount of approximately  may be paid in cash or common shares at the option of the company  subject to certain restrictions  commencing on january   at a fixed conversion price of per common share 
the company also issued to laurus a warrant to purchase  shares of common stock at per share 
the warrants were valued using the black scholes model and the following assumptions volatility of  an expected life years  and a risk free interest rate of 
the securities purchase agreement with laurus provides for a security interest in substantially all of the company s assets and provides laurus a right of first refusal on future financing arrangements during the term of the agreement 
in the event laurus declines to exercise its right of first refusal  it agreed to enter into such documentation as shall be reasonable requested by the company in order to subordinate its rights under the series d to the subsequent financier 
net cash proceeds from this financing were  which included repayments of  of principal related to the july  term note and  of issuance costs 
on may   the company amended the series d and the certificate of vote of directors establishing a class or series of stock 
the terms of the amendment permit the company to defer approximately  of cash payments  representing the january  february and march amortization payments  and to defer the october amortization payment  should such payment be required in cash  to the mandatory redemption date of september  in consideration  the company has agreed to the conversion of the april  may  june  july  august and september amortization payments into  shares of common stock of the company at a conversion price of per share  representing a reduction in principal of approximately  and to reduce the fixed conversion price of the remaining series d stock from per share to per share 
in addition  laurus was granted a warrant to purchase  shares of the company s common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the warrants were valued using the black scholes model and the following assumptions volatility of  an expected life years  and a risk free interest rate of 
the amendment of the series d  as described above  was accounted for as an extinguishment of debt in accordance with eitf debtor s accounting for a modification or exchange of debt instruments 
the company determined a substantial difference in the net present value of the cash flows under the terms of the amendment was more than percent different from the present value of the remaining cash flows under the terms of the original series d agreement 
due to the substantial difference  the company determined an extinguishment of debt had occurred with the amendment  and as such  it was necessary to reflect the series d at its fair market value 
accordingly  the following table shows the basis for the series d extinguishment extinguishment of series d debt instrument at may  redemption payments due unamortized discount of warrants  derivative value of preferred stock conversion and issue costs derivatives related to the preferred stock features subtotal record new series d debt instrument at may  fair value of redemption payments made issuance of  warrants unamortized discount of warrants  derivative value of preferred stock conversion and issue costs derivatives related to the preferred stock features subtotal loss on extinguishment of series d debt instrument the  aggregate loss from these transactions  accounted for as an extinguishment of debt  is included in other expenses for the year ended june  on september   the company extended the expiration date of its revolving credit facility for  with silicon valley based bridge bank  na the revolving credit facility expiring december   provides for advances of up to eighty percent of the company s eligible accounts receivable  bears interest at the prime rate plus one half percent  and is collateralized by certain assets of the company 
the credit facility is also subject to various financial covenants 
as of june    has been drawn on this credit facility and the company is in compliance with the covenants 
since may  we have been developing several explosive detection systems that could be used in airports  public and government buildings  and sporting event facilities 
the systems use our proprietary laser ims technology  which includes the use of laser beams in combination with ion mobility spectrometry  to electronically detect minute quantities of explosive vapor molecules in the air 
this project is currently being undertaken by both our internal scientists and outside contractors 
the development of new applications is typically funded through government grants or internal funding 
since march  we have received seventeen contracts totaling over million for detection of toxic chemicals or explosives from agencies such as the departments of the army  air force  marine corps  navy and the department of homeland security 
in june  we developed our first generation device  which demonstrated sensitivity to the explosive tnt 
in june  we developed a second generation prototype with increased sensitivity and selectivity 
this device can detect and specify an increasing number of compounds within various explosive materials 
the explosives that have been tested to date are tnt  rdx  petn  egdn  and dnt 
rdx is the primary component of c and c explosives  such as datasheet and semtex  as well as certain types of black powder explosives 
we believe these explosives represent the majority of the explosives presently used in terrorist activities 
we are now manufacturing several versions of our explosives detection systems  including i a table top unit  which can be used to screen passengers and carry on baggage in airports and ii a portable system  which can be used to clear buildings  aircrafts  or ships where hidden bombs are believed to exist 
we are also developing  in conjunction with a contract from the transportation security administration  a walk through passenger portal 
we are currently selling our portable and bench top version of these products both domestically and internationally 
we plan to market these systems to us government agencies for use in airports  government buildings and facilities 
we are currently expending significant resources to develop the next generation of our current product and to develop new products 
although we continue to fund as much research and development as possible through government grants and contracts in accordance with the provisions of the respective grant awards we will require additional funding in order to continue the advancement of the commercial development and manufacturing of the explosives detection system 
we will attempt to obtain such financing by i government grants  ii private financing  or iii strategic partnerships 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our attempts to raise such additional financing 
consistent with our policy to protect our proprietary technologies  we have been awarded five patents and have submitted an additional four patent applications to the united states patent and trademark office 
these patents and applications will cover specific design configurations that are responsible for our improved vapor detection sensitivity 
we will require substantial funds for further research and development  regulatory approvals and the marketing of our explosives detection products 
our capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including but not limited to  the progress of our research and development programs  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  changes in our development of commercialization activities and arrangements  and the hiring of additional personnel and capital equipment 
as of june   we were conducting our operations with approximately  in cash and cash equivalents 
we estimate that our cash flow from operations and funds available on our revolving line of credit to be sufficient to fund our working capital in the next twelve months 
future expenditures for research and product development  especially relating to outside testing  are discretionary and  accordingly  can be adjusted  as can certain selling  general and administrative expenses  based on the availability of cash 
based on the current sales  expense and cash flow projections  the company believes that the current level of cash and cash equivalents on hand  the net proceeds from its revolving line of credit and a m contract received from the us army in august  will be sufficient to fund operations until the company achieves positive cash flow 
however  because there can be no assurances that sales will materialize as forecasted  management will continue to closely monitor and attempt to control costs at the company and will continue to actively seek the needed capital through government grants and awards  strategic alliances  private financing sources  and through its lending institutions 
the financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the company be unable to continue as a going concern 
the company s future minimum payments under contractual obligations related to capital leases  operating leases and term notes as of june  are as follows debt and capital lease operating lease med tec total year ending june total relates to med tec payment obligation and includes  accrued interest 
see note of the consolidated financial statements critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of our form k as of june  our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  product returns  inventories  investments  intangible assets  embedded derivatives and warranty obligations 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
however  results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company has identified the following as critical accounting policies  based on the significant judgments and estimates used in determining the amounts reported in its financial statements revenue recognition product and government contract revenues the company recognizes revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement with the customer which states a fixed or determinable price and terms  delivery of the product has occurred or the service performed in accordance with the terms of the arrangement  and collectibility of the sale is reasonably assured 
government contract revenue under cost sharing research and development agreements is recognized as eligible research and development expenses are incurred 
the company s obligation with respect to these agreements is to perform the research on a best efforts basis 
for government contracts with a deliverable  revenue is recognized based upon the proportional performance method  revenues for which the company has received payment  but has not yet recognized the revenues  pending fulfilling its obligations under the sales agreement  are reflected on the balance sheet as deferred revenues 
treatment systems planning revenues consists of sales of software licenses and maintenance agreements  product related training  installation  and consulting  and the associated hardware 
revenue from sales of software licenses and maintenance agreements is recognized ratably over the maintenance contract period  which is generally one year  pursuant to the guidance provided by statement of position sop  software revenue recognition sop  issued by the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa 
revenue from training  installation  consulting services and the associated hardware are recognized as the services are performed or product is delivered  provided there is vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value which is the price charged when the services are sold separately 
revenues related to such sales generated during the year ended june  were  revenues related to such sales in were immaterial and there were no such revenues generated during the year ended june  accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
judgments are used in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts and are based on a combination of factors 
such factors include historical collection experience  credit policy and specific customer collection issues 
in circumstances where the company is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us eg  bankruptcy filings  we record a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers 
while actual bad debts have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same bad debt rates that we have in the past 
a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any of our customers could result in the uncollectibility of the related accounts receivable and could adversely impact our operating cash flows in that period 
sales returns and allowances the company records reductions to revenue for estimated customer returns and allowances 
we record estimated allowances against revenues in the same period the revenue is recorded 
these estimates are based upon historical analysis of our credit memo data and other known factors for pricing and disputes that arise in the normal course of business 
to date  allowances have not been material 
actual returns may differ significantly from our estimates if factors such as economic conditions or competitive conditions differ from our expectations 
inventories we value our inventories at lower of cost or market 
cost is determined by the first in  first out fifo method  including material  labor and factory overhead 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  management judgment is required to determine the reserve for obsolete or excess inventory 
inventory on hand may exceed future demand either because the product is obsolete  or because the amount on hand is more than can be used to meet future need 
we provide for the total value of inventories that we determine to be obsolete or excess based on criteria such as customer demand and changing technologies 
warranties we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
we record an estimate for warranty related costs at the time of sale based on our actual historical return rates and repair costs 
while our warranty costs have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same warranty return rates or repair costs that we have in the past

valuation of certain marketable equity securities the company currently classifies its investment securities as available for sale securities 
pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  such securities are measured at fair market value in the financial statements with unrealized gains or losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income until the securities are sold or otherwise disposed of 
however  in accordance with sfas no 
 a decline in fair market value below cost that is other than temporary is accounted for as a realized loss 
to date  we have not experienced any realized losses 
income taxes the income tax accounting process involves estimating our current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we must then record a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets of  as of june   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize these assets 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to adjust our valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
goodwill and intangible assets sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives no longer be amortized but instead be measured for impairment at least annually or whenever events indicate that there may be an impairment 
in order to determine if an impairment exists  management compares the reporting unit s carrying value to the reporting unit s fair value 
determining the reporting unit s fair value requires management to make estimates based on market conditions and operational performance 
absent an event that indicates a specific impairment may exist  management has selected august st as the date of performing the annual goodwill impairment test 
future events could cause management to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill associated with the company s acquired businesses is impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
intangible assets with finite lives consist of acquired customer base  technology and trademarks and are valued according to the future cash flows they are estimated to produce 
these assigned values are amortized on a basis which matches the periods in which those cash flows are estimated to be produced  or straight line over the estimated useful lives  if no other method provides a better result 
the company continually evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that the estimated remaining useful life of our intangible assets may warrant revision or that the carrying value of these assets may be impaired 
to compute whether intangible assets with finite lives been impaired  the estimated undiscounted future cash flows for the estimated remaining useful life of the assets are compared to the carrying value 
to the extent that the future cash flows are less than the carrying value  the assets are written down to the estimated fair value of the asset

eitf requires that a change in the fair value of a conversion option brought about by modifying the debt agreement be included in analyzing in accordance with eitf consensus on issue no 
 debtor s accounting for a modification or exchange of debt instruments eitf  whether a debt instrument is considered extinguished 
under eitf s requirements  an issuer who modifies a debt instrument must compare the present value of the original debt instrument s cash flows to the present value of the cash flows of the modified debt 
if the present value of those cash flows varies by more than percent  the modification is considered significant and extinguishments accounting is applied to the original debt 
if the change in the present value of the cash flows is less than percent  the debt is considered to be modified and is subject to eitf s modification accounting 
eitf requires that in applying the percent test the change in the fair value of the conversion option be treated in the same manner as a current period cash flow 
eitf also requires that  if a modification does not result in an extinguishment  the change in fair value of the conversion option be accounted for as an adjustment to interest expense over the remaining term of the debt 
the issuer should not recognize a beneficial conversion feature or reassess an existing beneficial conversion feature upon modification of the conversion option of a debt instrument that does not result in an extinguishment

a discount on the convertible debt is recognized for the amount that is allocated to additional paid in capital 
the debt discount is accreted from the date of issuance to the stated redemption date of the convertible instrument or through the earliest conversion date if the instrument does not have a stated redemption date 
the us federal income tax code includes the entire amount of proceeds received at issuance as the tax basis of the convertible debt security
