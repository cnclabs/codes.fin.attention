item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are a leading supplier of construction materials 
on july   we completed the spin off of our steel segment in the form of a pro rata  tax free dividend to our shareholders of one share of chaparral steel company chaparral common stock for each share of our common stock that was owned on july  the results of operations of the steel segment prior to the spin off are presented as discontinued operations 
see notes to consolidated financial statements footnote entitled discontinued operations on pages and unless otherwise indicated our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations relates to our continuing operations 
we have organized our continuing operations into three business segments cement  aggregates and consumer products 
our principal products are gray portland cement  produced and sold through our cement segment  stone  sand and gravel  produced and sold through our aggregates segment  and ready mix concrete  produced and sold through our consumer products segment 
other products include expanded shale and clay aggregates  produced and sold through our aggregates segment  and packaged concrete and related products  produced and sold through our consumer products segment 
our facilities are concentrated primarily in texas  louisiana and california 
during fiscal year  we commenced construction on a project to expand and modernize our oro grande  california cement plant 
we plan to expand the oro grande plant to approximately million tons of advanced dry process cement production capacity annually  and retire the million tons of existing  but less efficient  production after the new plant is commissioned 
we expect the oro grande project will take at least two years to construct and will cost approximately million 
we own long term reserves of the primary raw materials for the production of cement and aggregates 
our business requires large amounts of capital investment  energy  labor and maintenance 
our corporate administrative  financial  legal  environmental  human resources and real estate activities are not allocated to operations and are excluded from operating profit 

table of contents results of operations the following table highlights certain of our operating information 
year ended may  in thousands except per unit sales cement stone  sand and gravel ready mix concrete other products interplant delivery fees net sales shipments cement tons stone  sand and gravel tons ready mix concrete cubic yards prices cement ton stone  sand and gravel ton ready mix concrete cubic yards cost of sales cement ton stone  sand and gravel ton ready mix concrete cubic yards fiscal year compared to fiscal year gross profit at million increased million from fiscal year as a result of improved margins 
net sales 
net sales at million increased million from fiscal year total cement sales increased million on higher average prices and lower shipments 
total stone  sand and gravel sales increased million on higher average prices and shipments 
total ready mix concrete sales increased million on higher average prices and higher volume 
construction activity in the texas and california markets we serve remains solid 
average prices for our major products continue to improve 
average selling prices for cement increased throughout the year  following price increase announcements in the summer and spring quarters 
these price increases followed increases in costs of sales discussed below 
average prices for stone  sand and gravel and ready mix concrete had a similar pattern during the year 
cement shipments during the year declined because of lower beginning inventories and the lack of availability of outside purchases of cement and clinker in certain markets 
we believe market conditions should continue to support the current level of pricing 
cost of sales 
cost of products sold at million increased million from fiscal year cement unit costs increased 
energy costs representing of total cement costs increased 
stone  sand and gravel unit costs increased 
energy and maintenance costs representing of total stone  sand and gravel costs increased and  respectively 
ready mix concrete unit costs increased  primarily due to price increases in its cement and aggregate raw materials 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense at million increased million from fiscal year operating selling  general and administrative expense at million increased million  primarily due to million higher incentive compensation expense offset by

other income 
other income at million increased million from fiscal year operating other income at million increased million 
included in operating other income were a gain of million from the sale of real estate in and a gain of million from the sale of emissions credits in both sales were associated with our expanded shale and clay aggregate operations in south texas 
additional routine sales of surplus operating assets resulted in gains of million in and million in corporate other income increased million to million primarily as a result of an increase of million in interest and real estate income and a gain of million from the sale of an investment 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year gross profit at million increased million from fiscal year favorable weather and improved cement production efficiencies in the may quarter contributed to improved margins for the year 
net sales 
net sales at million increased million from fiscal year total cement sales increased million on higher average prices and higher shipments 
total stone  sand and gravel sales increased million on higher average prices and higher shipments 
total ready mix concrete sales increased million on higher average prices and higher volume 
continued solid demand for our major products resulted in higher average selling prices 
favorable weather in the may quarter increased shipments

cost of products sold at million increased million from fiscal year cement unit costs increased 
energy costs and maintenance costs representing of total costs increased and  respectively 
stone  sand and gravel unit costs increased 
energy and maintenance costs representing of total costs were up and  respectively 
increased shipments reduced the effect of higher costs on overall unit costs 
ready mix concrete unit costs increased  primarily due to increases in raw material costs 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense at million increased million from fiscal year operating selling  general and administrative expense at million decreased million  primarily due to lower bad debt and insurance expenses offset in part by million higher incentive compensation expense

interest expense interest expense at million increased million from fiscal year interest expense capitalized in conjunction with our oro grande  california cement plant expansion and modernization project reduced the amount of interest expense recognized by million 
total interest expense to be capitalized related to this project during the two year construction period is currently estimated at million 
in connection with the spin off of chaparral  we entered into new financing agreements and purchased the outstanding million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due on july   we 
table of contents issued million aggregate principal amount of new senior notes due and entered into a separate new senior secured revolving credit facility 
prior to the spin off of chaparral  interest was allocated to discontinued operations based on the amount of our consolidated debt attributed to the steel operations 
the total amount of interest allocated was million in  million in and million in loss on early retirement of debt loss on debt retirements and spin off charges includes a loss of million related to the early retirement of our senior notes and old credit facility consisting of million in premiums and consent payments plus transaction costs and a write off of million of debt issuance costs and interest rate swap gains and losses associated with the debt purchased 
we also incurred expense of  related to the may conversion of million of convertible subordinated debentures 
in addition  we incurred million in charges related to the spin off of chaparral in july we recognized a loss on early retirement of debt of million in fiscal year as a result of the june refinancing and may partial termination of our old senior secured credit facility 
income taxes our effective tax rate for continuing operations was in  in and in the primary reason that the effective tax rate differed from the statutory corporate rate was due to state income taxes  additional percentage depletion that is tax deductible and  in  spin off and debt conversion costs that are not tax deductible 
the effective rate for discontinued operations was in  in and in we incurred federal and state net operating losses in a portion of the federal net operating loss is planned to be carried back and offset against federal taxable income in with the remaining balance carried forward against expected federal taxable income in the state net operating losses are planned to be carried forward against expected state taxable income in and subsequent years 
accounts receivable in includes million representing the expected tax refund claim 
deferred taxes include a million alternative minimum tax credit carryforward that is available for offset against future regular federal income taxes 
the american jobs creation act of  among other things  allows a deduction for income from qualified domestic production activities  which will be phased in from through we did not realize a benefit in because of a taxable loss for the year 
income from discontinued operations net of income taxes as a result of the spin off of chaparral  the operating results of our steel segment  including the allocation of certain corporate expenses  have been reclassified and presented as discontinued operations 
fiscal year includes steel operations through the july  spin off date 
cumulative effect of accounting change net of income taxes effective june   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets 
we incur legal obligations for asset retirement as part of our normal operations related to land reclamation  plant removal and resource conservation and recovery act closures 
application of the new rules resulted in a cumulative charge of million  net of income taxes of  in fiscal year 
table of contents critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported 
changes in the facts and circumstances could have a significant impact on the resulting financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect management s more complex judgments and estimates 
receivables 
management evaluates the ability to collect accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
a reserve for doubtful accounts is maintained based on the length of time receivables are past due or the status of a customer s financial condition 
if we are aware of a specific customer s inability to make required payments  specific amounts are added to the reserve 
environmental liabilities 
we are subject to environmental laws and regulations established by federal  state and local authorities  and make provision for the estimated costs related to compliance when it is probable that a reasonably estimable liability has been incurred 
legal contingencies 
we are defendants in lawsuits which arose in the normal course of business  and make provision for the estimated loss from any claim or legal proceeding when it is probable that a reasonably estimable liability has been incurred 
long lived assets 
management reviews long lived assets for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable and would record an impairment charge if necessary 
such evaluations compare the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset and are significantly impacted by estimates of future prices for our products  capital needs  economic trends and other factors 
goodwill 
management tests goodwill for impairment at least annually 
if the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized 
in applying a fair value based test  estimates are made of the expected future cash flows to be derived from the applicable reporting unit 
similar to the review for impairment of other long lived assets  the resulting fair value determination is significantly impacted by estimates of future prices for our products  capital needs  economic trends and other factors 
new accounting standards 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb among other items  sfas r eliminates the use of apb and the intrinsic value method of accounting  and requires companies to recognize in the financial statements the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments  based on the grant date fair value of those awards 
we will adopt sfas r effective june  using the modified prospective method 
under the modified prospective method  compensation cost is recognized in the financial statements beginning with the effective date  based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after that date  and based on the requirements of sfas for all unvested awards granted prior to the effective date of sfas r 
financial information for periods prior to the date of adoption of sfas r would not be restated 
we currently utilize a standard option pricing model ie  black scholes to measure the fair value of stock options granted to employees 
while sfas r permits entities to continue to use such a model  the standard also permits the use of a lattice model 
we have not yet determined which model we will use to measure the fair value of awards of equity instruments to employees upon the adoption of sfas r 
the adoption of sfas no 
r will not have an impact on our consolidated financial position 
although the impact of sfas no 
r on our results of operations can not be predicted at this time because it will depend on the number of equity awards granted in the future  as well as the model used to value the awards  it is expected to have a significant effect on our future results of operations 
however  had we adopted the requirements of sfas no 
r in prior periods  the impact would have approximated the amounts disclosed in summary of significant accounting policies stock based compensation in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents sfas r also requires that the benefits associated with the tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after the effective date 
these future amounts cannot be estimated  because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter  which will become effective for us beginning june  this standard clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material should be expensed as incurred and not included in overhead 
in addition  this standard requires that the allocation of fixed production overhead cost to inventory be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
we are currently evaluating the potential impact of this standard on our financial position and results of operations 
in march  the emerging issues task force reached a consensus on issue  accounting for stripping costs incurred during production in the mining industry  which will become effective for us beginning june  eitf requires that stripping costs incurred during the production phase of the mine be included in the costs of the inventory produced during the period that the stripping costs are incurred 
in june  the eitf modified the consensus requiring entities to recognize any cumulative effect adjustment in retained earnings in the period of adoption 
as of may   the balance of our post production capitalized stripping costs was million 
in accordance with the transition provision of eitf  the company will write off these deferred costs to retained earnings on june   and prospectively recognize the costs of all post production stripping activity as a cost of the inventory produced during the period the stripping costs are incurred 
although dependent in part on the future level of post production stripping activity which varies from period to period  we do not expect that the adoption of eitf will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations for periods following adoption 
liquidity and capital resources in addition to cash and cash equivalents of million at may   our sources of liquidity include cash from operations  proceeds from sales of our short term investments  borrowings available under our million senior secured revolving credit facility and distributions available from our investments in life insurance contracts 
short term investments 
our short term investments  totaling million at may   consist of investment grade auction rate securities with an active resale market to ensure liquidity and the ability to be readily converted into cash 
these securities are expected to be sold within one year to fund current operations  or satisfy other cash requirements as needed 
senior secured revolving credit facility 
we have available a million senior secured revolving credit facility expiring in july it includes a million sub limit for letters of credit 
any outstanding letters of credit are deducted from the borrowing availability under the facility 
at may   million of the facility was utilized to support letters of credit 
amounts drawn under the facility bear interest either at the libor rate plus a margin of to  or at a base rate which is the higher of the federal funds rate plus and the prime rate plus a margin of up to 
the interest rate margins are subject to adjustments based on our leverage ratio 
all of our consolidated subsidiaries  following the spin off of chaparral  have guaranteed our obligations under the credit facility 
the credit facility is secured by first priority security interests in all or most of our existing and future accounts  inventory  equipment  intellectual property and other personal property  and in all of our equity interest in present and future domestic subsidiaries and of the equity interest in any future foreign subsidiaries 

table of contents the credit facility contains covenants restricting  among other things  prepayment or redemption of our new senior notes  distributions  dividends and repurchases of capital stock and other equity interests  acquisitions and investments  indebtedness  liens and affiliate transactions 
we are required to comply with certain financial tests and to maintain certain financial ratios  such as leverage and interest coverage ratios 
we are in compliance with all of our loan covenants 
investments in life insurance contracts 
during we repaid previous distributions received from our investments in life insurance contracts in the amount of million 
approximately million of these funds are available for redistribution at our election 
contractual obligations 
the following is a summary of our estimated future payments under our material contractual obligations as of may  future payments by period in thousands total after borrowings long term debt convertible subordinated debentures interest leases coal supply contracts other unconditional purchase obligations asset retirement obligations defined benefit plans our long term debt is described in notes to consolidated financial statements footnote entitled long term debt on pages through our outstanding letters of credit issued under the senior secured revolving credit facility only collateralize payment of recorded liabilities 
our convertible subordinated debentures are described in notes to consolidated financial statements footnote entitled convertible subordinated debentures on pages and we lease certain mobile and other equipment  office space and other items used in our operations under operating leases that may in the normal course of business be renewed or replaced by subsequent leases 
future payments under leases exclude mineral rights which are insignificant and are generally required only for products produced 
in december we renegotiated three long term contracts for the purchase of coal for use in our cement and expanded shale and clay plants in texas that now require minimum amounts of coal be purchased 
we expect to utilize these required amounts in the normal course of business operations 
these future minimum payment amounts exclude transportation surcharges that may be imposed under certain circumstances 
we have entered into construction and equipment purchase contracts in connection with the expansion and modernization of our oro grande  california cement plant 
we expect the project will take at least two years to construct with actual capital expenditures occurring as the work progresses 
we incur legal obligations for asset retirement as part of our normal operations related to land reclamation  plant removal and resource conservation and recovery act closures 
we pay benefits under a series of non qualified defined benefit plans 
we pay benefits under a health benefit plan covering approximately employees and retirees of our california cement subsidiary 
these employees are also covered by a qualified defined benefit pension plan 
we contribute amounts sufficient to meet minimum funding requirements as set forth in employee benefit and tax laws plus additional amounts considered appropriate 
we expect to make a plan contribution of million in fiscal year during fiscal year  we commenced construction on a project to expand and modernize our oro grande  california cement plant 
we plan to expand the oro grande plant to approximately million tons of 
table of contents advanced dry process cement production capacity annually  and retire the million tons of existing  but less efficient  production after the new plant is commissioned 
we expect the oro grande project will take at least two years to construct and will cost approximately million excluding capitalized interest related to the project 
we expect our capital expenditures in fiscal year  including those related to the expansion and modernization of our oro grande cement plant  to be approximately million 
we expect cash and cash equivalents  cash from operations  proceeds from sales of our short term investments  available borrowings under our senior secured revolving credit facility and available distributions from our investments in life insurance contracts to be sufficient to provide funds for capital expenditure commitments including the expansion and modernization of our oro grande  california cement plant  scheduled debt payments  working capital needs and other general corporate purposes for at least the next year 
cash flows net cash provided by continuing operating activities was million  compared to million in fiscal year the decrease resulted primarily from changes in working capital items and the utilization of tax benefits in accounts receivable increased million  primarily due to higher selling prices 
inventories increased million  primarily due to higher levels of clinker and finished cement 
accounts payable and accrued expenses increased million primarily as a result of increased accounts payable due to higher manufacturing costs and higher incentive compensation accruals 
we also incurred a federal net operating tax loss in that resulted in a million tax refund claim 
net cash used by continuing investing activities was million  compared to million in fiscal year capital expenditures incurred in connection with the expansion and modernization of our oro grande  california cement plant were million  up million from the prior year 
capital expenditures for normal replacement and technological upgrades of existing equipment and acquisitions to sustain our existing operations were million  down million from the prior year 
in  we invested million in auction rate securities 
in  we increased our investment in life insurance contracts primarily as a result of repaying million in prior distributions 
proceeds from asset disposals result from routine sales of surplus operating assets  which in fiscal year included the proceeds from the sale of real estate associated with our expanded shale and clay operations in south texas and in fiscal year included the proceeds from the sale of our brick production facilities in texas and louisiana 
net cash used for continuing financing activities was million  compared to million provided in fiscal year we purchased million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes  paying million in premiums and consent payments plus transaction costs 
to fund the purchase we issued million aggregate principal amount of our new senior notes and incurred million in debt issuance costs  received a cash dividend of million from chaparral and used million of cash and cash equivalents on hand 
net cash provided by discontinued operations was million  compared to million in fiscal year in connection with our refinancing and spin off transactions  chaparral issued million aggregate principal amount of senior notes and borrowed million under its new million credit facility 
the net proceeds were used to pay us a dividend of million 
other items environmental matters we are subject to federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning  among other matters  air emissions  furnace dust disposal and wastewater discharge 
we believe we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations  however  from time to time we receive claims from federal and state environmental regulatory agencies and entities asserting that we are or may be in violation 
table of contents of certain environmental laws and regulations 
based on our experience and the information currently available to us  we believe that such claims will not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
despite our compliance and experience  it is possible that we could be held liable for future charges which might be material but are not currently known or estimable 
in addition  changes in federal or state laws  regulations or requirements or discovery of currently unknown conditions could require additional expenditures by us 
market risk historically  we have not entered into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
because of the short duration of our investments  changes in market interest rates would not have a significant impact on their fair value 
the fair value of fixed rate debt will vary as interest rates change 
the estimated fair value of each class of financial instrument as of may  approximates its carrying value except for long term debt having fixed interest rates and convertible subordinated debentures 
the fair value of long term debt at may   estimated based on broker dealer quoted market prices  is approximately million compared to the carrying amount of million 
the fair value of convertible subordinated debentures at may   estimated based on nyse quoted market prices  is approximately million compared to the carrying amount of million 
our operations require large amounts of energy and are dependent upon energy sources  including electricity and fossil fuels 
prices for energy are subject to market forces largely beyond our control 
in december we renegotiated three contracts for the purchase of coal for use in our cement and expanded shale and clay plants in texas 
each contract specifies a fixed price escalated quarterly or annually at which we must purchase a minimum amount of coal each calendar year through  and we may purchase additional amounts up to a specified maximum 
we have generally not entered into any long term contracts to satisfy our natural gas and electricity needs 
however  we continually monitor these markets and we may decide in the future to enter into long term contracts 
if we are unable to meet our requirements for fuel and electricity  we may experience interruptions in our production 
price increases or disruption of the uninterrupted supply of these products could adversely affect our results of operations
