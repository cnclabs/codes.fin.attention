d million of the fhlb advances matured during and were not replaced 
e the decrease in long term borrowings was due to the paydown of our note with the bank of north dakota 
f the increase in stockholders equity was due to the common stock offering of  shares and net income for investment securities available for sale our investment policy is designed to enhance net income and return on equity through prudent management of risk  ensure liquidity for cash flow requirements  help manage interest rate risk  ensure collateral is available for public deposits  advances and repurchase agreements and manage asset diversification 
in managing the portfolio  we seek a balance between current income yield and future market value volatility  while simultaneously managing credit and liquidity risks 
the goal of this process is to maximize our longer term profitability as well as the economic performance of the portfolio over the long term

actual maturities may vary because obligors may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties 
yield reflects changes in fair value that are reflected as a separate component of stockholders equity 
as of december   we had million of available for sale securities in the investment portfolio as compared to and million at december  and  respectively  based on fair value of the securities on those dates 
during  the amount of available for sale securities decreased million 
in managing the overall risk reward profile of the available for sale portfolio in the context of the overall balance sheet  during the first half of  much of the principal cash flow from collateralized mortgage obligations cmos was utilized to purchase state and municipal bonds 
this resulted in an increase in the volume of state and municipal bonds for  relative to  of million 
during the second half of  most of the proceeds from maturities and principal cash flow from the portfolio provided liquidity to fund growth in other earnings assets  in particular  loans held for sale 
during  the total volume of cmos  decreased by million relative to in addition  us government agency securities  corporate bonds  and us government agency mortgage backed securities decreased by million  million  and million respectively 
in the process of managing the risk reward profile of the portfolio as a whole  during a limited number of securities were sold and in the process   of book losses were realized 
during the first quarter of  the available for sale portfolio increased million from million as of december  to million in order to maintain the level of earning assets while planned loan reductions and the completion of some financed commercial real estate projects reduced the loans held for investment by million during the same period 
over the remaining three quarters of  the available for sale portfolio decreased by million to end the year at million as proceeds from sales and maturities  net of new purchases were directed toward an increase in loan volume for the latter three quarters of finally  the overall level of market interest rates increased during and the yield curve experienced a flattening relative to the end of we engaged in securities transactions that generated net realized securities gains of  during during  the amount of available for sale securities increased million in order to maintain earning asset portfolio levels while planned loan reductions and the completion of some financed commercial real estate projects reduced the loan portfolio by million 
much of the increase in available for sale securities was directed toward cmos because of their economic risk reward profiles due to the structure of the cmo cash flows relative to mortgage backed or other types of securities and the ability to pledge such securities as collateral for borrowings at the fhlb 
we decreased us government agency mortgage backed securities and us government agency securities by and million  respectively  and increased cmos and state and municipal bonds by and million  respectively 
given our forecasted level of future earnings  we increased our holdings of state and municipal bonds by million in order to increase our level of tax exempt income 
at december   we held no securities of any single issuer  other than us government agency securities and agency mortgage backed securities and cmos that exceeded percent of stockholders equity 
a significant portion of our investment securities portfolio approximately million at december  was pledged as collateral for public deposits and borrowings  including borrowings with the fhlb 
federal reserve bank and federal home loan bank stock our equity securities consisted of  and million of federal reserve bank frb stock at december   and  respectively  and  and million of fhlb stock at december   and  respectively 
our holdings in frb stock increased due to the amount of capital stock issued by the bank

b the increases in and are primarily attributable to commercial real estate construction loan growth in our arizona and minnesota markets 
c the increase in was due to a higher volume of one to five year leases with a customer from the bismarck branch 
while prospects for loan growth appear to be favorable in our markets  future loan growth potential is subject to volatility 
our loan portfolio is concentrated in commercial  industrial and real estate and construction loans and we have credit concentrations in certain industries concentrations of credit and certain geographic concentrations that relate to our primary market areas 
a downturn in certain sectors of the economy could adversely impact our borrowers 
this could  in turn  reduce the demand for loans and impact the borrowers ability to repay their loans  while also decreasing our net interest margin 
taking a conservative posture relative to credit underwriting  we believe  is a prudent course of action 
we cannot predict with any degree of certainty the full impact of current or future economic conditions on our ability to generate loan volume or the ultimate impact of economic conditions on our currently existing portfolio of loans 
see factors that may affect future results of operations included under item of part i 
credit policy  underwriting  approval and review procedures we follow a uniform credit policy that sets forth underwriting and loan administration criteria 
the board of directors the board establishes our loan policy  including lending guidelines for the various types of credit we offer based upon the recommendations of senior lending management 
we have an executive credit committee that approves loans over a certain size 
our loan policy is reviewed and reaffirmed by the board at least annually 
we delegate lending decision authority among various lending officers and the executive credit committee based on the size of the customer s credit relationship with bnc 
all loans and commitments approved in excess of  are presented to the board on a quarterly basis for summary review 
any exceptions to loan policies and guidelines  to the extent the credit relationship amount exceeds individual loan officer lending authorities  are subject to special approval by the bank s chief credit officer or the appropriate credit committee 
underwriting criteria are based upon the risks associated with each type of credit offered  the related borrowers and types of collateral 
in underwriting commercial loans  we emphasize the borrower s earnings history  capitalization and secondary sources of repayment 
in most instances  we require third party guarantees or highly liquid collateral 
our credit administration function includes an internal loan review department that reviews established levels of our loan portfolio on a continuous basis 
loan review personnel are not involved in any way in the credit approval process 
additionally  our lenders  loan review staff  chief credit officer  executive credit committee and various management team members review credit related information monthly 
such information includes  but may not be limited to  delinquencies  classified and nonperforming assets  and other information 
such reviews are conducted in order to evaluate credit risk within our credit portfolio and to review and establish the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses 
loan participations pursuant to our lending policy  loans may not exceed percent of the bank s legal lending limit except to the extent collateralized by us treasury securities or bank deposits and  accordingly  excluded from the bank s legal lending limit unless the chief credit officer and the executive credit committee grant prior approval 
to accommodate customers whose financing needs exceed lending limits and internal loan restrictions relating primarily to industry concentration  the bank sells loan participations to outside participants without recourse 
the bank generally retains the right to service the loans as well as the right to receive a portion of the interest income on the loans 
loan participations sold on a nonrecourse basis to outside financial institutions were as follows as of the dates indicated loan participations sold december  in thousands concentrations of credit our credit policies emphasize diversification of risk among industries  geographic areas and borrowers 
for purposes of the analysis of concentrations of credit as of december  the total outstanding loans as well as all outstanding loan commitments were included 
as of december   we identified two concentrations of loans exceeding percent of total loans and loan commitments outstanding 
these concentrations were in real estate and construction  which represented and percent  respectively  of total loans and loan commitments outstanding 
our real estate loans and commitments were extended to customers who are diversified across our market areas and who can generally be categorized as indicated below percent of total outstanding outstanding loans number of loans and loan and loan as of december  customers commitments commitments non residential and apartment building operators  developers and lessors of real property real estate holding and other investment companies total loans and commitments in the construction category were extended to customers who are located primarily in minnesota  iowa  north dakota and south dakota and who can generally be categorized as indicated below percent of total outstanding outstanding loans number of loans and loan and loan as of december  customers commitments commitments residential and nonresidential buildings heavy and civil engineering specialty trade contractors total the contractors are involved in various aspects of the construction industry  including highway and street construction  water sewer drilling  plumbing  heating and air conditioning  commercial painting  electrical  concrete and excavating and foundation contractors 
loans in this category are secured  in many cases  by construction equipment 
loan maturities the following table sets forth the remaining maturities of loans in each major category of our portfolio as of december  actual maturities may differ from the contractual maturities shown below as a result of renewals and prepayments 
loan renewals are evaluated in the same manner as new credit applications maturities of loans over year through years over years one year fixed floating fixed floating or less rate rate rate rate total in thousands commercial and industrial real estate mortgage real estate construction agricultural consumer other lease financing total principal amount of loans nonperforming loans and assets nonperforming loans consist of loans days or more delinquent and still accruing interest  nonaccrual and restructured loans 
other nonperforming assets includes other real estate owned and repossessed assets 
our lending personnel are responsible for continuous monitoring of the quality of the loan portfolio 
officers are expected to maintain loan quality and deal with credit issues in a timely and proactive manner 
loan officers are responsible for regular reviews of past due loans in their respective portfolios 
the loan portfolio is also monitored regularly and examined by our loan review personnel 
loans demonstrating weaknesses are downgraded in a timely fashion and the board receives a listing of all such loans on a quarterly basis 
the following table sets forth  as of the dates indicated  the amounts of nonperforming loans and other assets  the allowance for credit losses and certain related ratios nonperforming assets december  dollars in thousands nonperforming loans loans days or more delinquent and still accruing interest nonaccrual loans restructured loans total nonperforming loans other real estate owned and repossessed assets total nonperforming assets allowance for credit losses ratio of total nonperforming loans to total loans held for investment ratio of total nonperforming assets to total assets ratio of allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans from continuing operations for and loans days or more delinquent and still accruing interest include loans over days past due which we believe  based on our specific analysis of the loans  do not present doubt about the collection of interest and principal in accordance with the loan contract 
loans in this category must be well secured and in the process of collection 
our lending and management personnel monitor these loans closely 
nonaccrual loans include loans on which the accrual of interest has been discontinued 
accrual of interest is discontinued when we believe  after considering economic and business conditions and collection efforts that the borrower s financial condition is such that the collection of interest is doubtful 
a delinquent loan is generally placed on nonaccrual status when it becomes days or more past due unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection 
when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status  accrued but uncollected interest income applicable to the current reporting period is reversed against interest income of the current period 
accrued but uncollected interest income applicable to previous reporting periods is charged against the allowance for credit losses 
no additional interest is accrued on the loan balance until the collection of both principal and interest becomes reasonably certain 
when a problem loan is finally resolved  there may ultimately be an actual write down or charge off of the principal balance of the loan which may necessitate additional charges to earnings 
restructured loans are those for which concessions  including a reduction of the interest rate or the deferral of interest or principal  have been granted due to the borrower s weakened financial condition 
interest on restructured loans is accrued at the restructured rates when it is anticipated that no loss of original principal will occur 
we had no restructured loans in our portfolio at december  other real estate owned and repossessed assets represent properties and other assets acquired through  or in lieu of  loan foreclosure 
they are initially recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition establishing a new cost basis 
write downs to fair value at the time of acquisition are charged to the allowance for credit losses 
after foreclosure  we perform valuations periodically and the real estate or assets are carried at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
write downs  revenues and expenses incurred subsequent to foreclosure are charged to operations as recognized incurred 
we had no outstanding other real estate owned or repossessed assets at december  our ratios of total nonperforming loans to total loans  and total nonperforming assets to total assets  decreased between december  and december  the ratio of the allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans increased between december  and december  this ratio at december  was  percent as compared to percent at december  these improvements in nonperforming loan asset ratios are primarily the result of a sharp decrease in nonperforming loans  which declined to  at december   from  at december  potential problem loans in accordance with accounting standards  we identify loans considered impaired and the valuation allowance attributable to these loans 
impaired loans generally include loans on which we believe  based on current information and events  it is probable that we will not be able to collect all amounts due in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement and which are analyzed for a specific reserve allowance 
we generally consider all loans risk graded substandard and doubtful as well as nonaccrual and restructured loans as impaired 
potential problem loans at december  totaled million as compared to million at december  a significant portion of these potential problem loans are not in default but may have characteristics such as recent adverse operating cash flows or general risk characteristics that the loan officer feels might jeopardize the future timely collection of principal and interest payments 
the ultimate resolution of these credits is subject to changes in economic conditions and other factors 
these loans are closely monitored to ensure that our position as creditor is protected to the fullest extent possible 
provision for credit losses we determine a provision for credit losses which we consider sufficient to maintain our allowance for credit losses at a level considered adequate to provide for an estimate of probable losses related to specifically identified loans as well as probable losses in the remaining loan and lease portfolio that have been incurred as of each balance sheet date 
the provision for credit losses for the year ended december  was  as compared to  in and million in loan and lease charge offs were  or percent of average loans and leases in compared with million  or percent in and million  or percent in recoveries of amounts previously charged off were   and  in   and  respectively 
the decrease in the provision for credit losses in reflected the resolution of a significant amount of nonperforming loans that were reserved for at december  and were reduced to  at december  from million at december  of the million of charge offs in  million related to one commercial loan 
 had been reserved for on that loan at december  allowance for credit losses credit risk is the risk of loss from a customer default 
we have in place a process to identify and manage our credit risk 
the process includes initial credit review and approval  periodic monitoring to measure compliance with credit agreements and internal credit policies  internal credit review  monitoring changes in the risk ratings of loans and leases  identification of problem loans and leases and special procedures for collection of problem loans and leases 
the risk of loss is difficult to quantify and is subject to fluctuations in values and general economic conditions and other factors 
as discussed previously  the determination of the allowance for credit losses is a critical accounting policy  which involves estimates and our judgment on a number of factors such as net charge offs  delinquencies in the loan and lease portfolio and general and economic conditions 
our allowance for credit losses was million at december  this included a million allowance for homogeneous loan pools   for specific reserves and  for qualitative reserves 
we consider the allowance for credit losses of million adequate to cover losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio as of december  however  no assurance can be given that we will not  in any particular period  sustain loan and lease losses that are sizable in relation to the amount reserved  or that subsequent evaluations of the loan and lease portfolio  in light of factors then prevailing  including economic conditions and our ongoing credit review process  will not require significant increases in the allowance for credit losses 
a protracted economic slowdown and or a decline in commercial  industrial or real estate segments may have an adverse impact on the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses by increasing credit risk and the risk of potential loss

as indicated above  the determined level of the allowance for credit losses involves assumptions underlying our estimates that reflect highly uncertain matters in the current period 
additionally  a different estimate that could have been used in the current period could have had a material impact on reported financial condition or results of operations 
we are not aware  at this time  of known trends  commitments  events or other uncertainties reasonably likely to occur that would materially affect our methodology or the assumptions used  although changes in the qualitative and quantitative factors noted above could occur at any time and such changes could be of a material nature 
we have used our assumptions to arrive at the level of the allowance for credit losses that we consider adequate to provide for an estimate of probable losses related to specifically identified loans as well as probable losses in the remaining loan and lease portfolio that have been incurred as of december  from period to period  economic situations change  credits may deteriorate or improve and the other factors we consider in arriving at our estimates may change 
however  our basic methodology for determining an appropriate allowance for credit losses has remained relatively stable 
this methodology has resulted in allowance levels of  and million at december   and  respectively 
as noted above  the amount of the provision for credit losses charged to operations is directly related to our estimates of the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses 
charge offs and recoveries during the applicable periods also impact the level of the allowance for credit losses resulting in a provision for credit losses that could be higher or lower in order to bring the allowance for credit losses in line with our estimates 
our ratio of allowance for credit losses to total loans was percent at december  compared with percent one year earlier 
the ratio at december  reflects million of charge offs over the course of the month period ended december   as well as the reduced reserve requirement related to the sharp decrease in nonperforming loans during the same period 
the table below presents  for the periods indicated an allocation of the allowance for credit losses among the various loan categories and sets forth the percentage of loans in each category to gross loans 
the allocation of the allowance for credit losses as shown in the table should neither be interpreted as an indication of future charge offs  nor as an indication that charge offs in future periods will necessarily occur in these amounts or in the indicated proportions

this trend has been common in the banking industry because of the proliferation of nonbank competitors and the multitude of financial and investment products available to customers as well as the need to utilize such funds in the process of our overall balance sheet management 
at times  access to brokered and out of market deposits is available at maturities and rates more favorable than those available in our local markets

capital resources and expenditures we actively monitor compliance with regulatory capital requirements  including risk based and leverage capital measures 
under the risk based capital method of capital measurement  the ratio computed is dependent on the amount and composition of assets recorded on the balance sheet  and the amount and composition of off balance sheet items  in addition to the level of capital

capital expenditures could also include the purchase or lease of additional facilities in our various market areas should such facilities or properties be deemed to add additional franchise value 
off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business  we are a party to various financial instruments with off balance sheet risk 
these instruments include commitments to extend credit  commercial letters of credit  performance and financial standby letters of credit and interest rate swaps  caps and floors 
such instruments help us to meet the needs of our customers  manage our interest rate risk and effectuate business combination transactions 
these instruments and commitments  which we enter into for purposes other than trading  carry varying degrees of credit  interest rate or liquidity risk in excess of the amount reflected in the consolidated balance sheets 
we have also entered into certain guarantee arrangements that are not reflected in the consolidated balance sheets 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements included under item for a detailed description of each of these instruments 
contractual obligations  contingent liabilities and commitments as disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included under item  we have certain contractual obligations  contingent liabilities and commitments 
at december   the aggregate contractual obligations excluding bank deposits  contingent liabilities and commitments were as follows in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations less than year to years to years after years total total borrowings annual rental commitments under non cancelable operating leases total amount of commitment expiration by period other commitments less than year to years to years after years total commitments to lend standby and commercial letters of credit total liquidity risk management liquidity risk is the possibility of being unable to meet all present and future financial obligations in a timely manner 
liquidity risk management encompasses our ability to meet all present and future financial obligations in a timely manner 
the objectives of liquidity management policies are to maintain adequate liquid assets  liability diversification among instruments  maturities and customers and a presence in both the wholesale purchased funds market and the retail deposit market 
the consolidated statements of cash flows in the consolidated financial statements included under item of part ii present data on cash and cash equivalents provided by and used in operating  investing and financing activities 
in addition to liquidity from core deposit growth  together with repayments and maturities of loans and investments  we utilize brokered deposits  sell securities under agreements to repurchase and borrow overnight federal funds 
the bank is a member of the fhlb  which affords it the opportunity to borrow funds in terms ranging from overnight to years and beyond 
advances from the fhlb are generally collateralized by the bank s mortgage loans and various investment securities 
see investment securities and note to the consolidated financial statements included under item of part ii 
we have also obtained funding through the issuance of subordinated notes  subordinated debentures and long term borrowings 
see borrowed funds  guaranteed preferred beneficial interests in company s subordinated debentures and notes and to the consolidated financial statements included under item of part ii for further information on these instruments

given the uncertain nature of our customers demands as well as our desire to take advantage of earnings enhancement opportunities  we must have adequate sources of on and off balance sheet funds that can be acquired in time of need 
we measure our liquidity position on a monthly basis 
key factors that determine our liquidity are the reliability or stability of our deposit base  the pledged non pledged status of our investments and potential loan demand 
our liquidity management system divides the balance sheet into liquid assets  and short term liabilities that are assumed to be vulnerable to non replacement under abnormally stringent conditions 
the excess of liquid assets over short term liabilities is measured over a day planning horizon 
assumptions for short term liabilities vulnerable to non replacement under abnormally stringent conditions are based on a historical analysis of the month to month percentage changes in deposits 
the excess of liquid assets over short term liabilities and other key factors such as expected loan demand as well as access to other sources of liquidity such as lines with the fhlb  federal funds and those other supplemental sources listed above are tied together to provide a measure of our liquidity 
we have a targeted range and manage our operations such that these targets can be achieved 
we believe that our prudent management policies and guidelines will ensure adequate levels of liquidity to fund anticipated needs of on and off balance sheet items 
in addition  a contingency funding policy statement identifies actions to be taken in response to an adverse liquidity event 
forward looking statements statements included in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations which are not historical in nature are intended to be  and are hereby identified as forward looking statements for purposes of the safe harbor provided by section a of the securities act and section e of the exchange act 
we caution readers that these forward looking statements  including without limitation  those relating to our future business prospects  revenues  working capital  liquidity  capital needs  interest costs  income and expenses  are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward looking statements due to several important factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to risks of loans and investments  including dependence on local and regional economic conditions  competition for our customers from other providers of financial services  possible adverse effects of changes in interest rates including the effects of such changes on derivative contracts and associated accounting consequences  risks associated with our acquisition and growth strategies  and other risks which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control 
effects of inflation unlike most industrial companies  the assets and liabilities of financial institutions are primarily monetary in nature 
therefore  banking organizations do not necessarily gain or lose due to the effects of inflation 
changes in interest rates  which are a major determinant of a financial service organization s profitability  do not necessarily correspond to changes in the prices of goods and services  however  interest rates may change in response to changes in expectations of future inflation 
an analysis of a banking organization s asset and liability structure provides the best indication of how the organization is positioned to respond to changing interest rates and maintain profitability 
the financial statements and supplementary financial data have been prepared  primarily  on a historical basis  which is mandated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
fluctuations in the relative value of money due to inflation or recession are generally not considered

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk arises from changes in interest rates  exchange rates  and commodity prices and equity prices and represents the possibility that changes in future market rates or prices will have a negative impact on our earnings or value 
our principal market risk is interest rate risk 
interest rate risk arises from changes in interest rates 
interest rate risk can result from repricing risk timing differences in the maturity repricing of assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet contracts  options risk the effect of embedded options  such as loan prepayments  interest rate caps floors  and deposit withdrawals  basis risk risk resulting from unexpected changes in the spread between two or more different rates of similar maturity  and the resulting impact on the behavior of lending and funding rates  and yield curve risk risk resulting from unexpected changes in the spread between two or more rates of different maturities from the same type of instrument 
we have risk management policies to monitor and limit exposure to interest rate risk 
to date we have not conducted trading activities as a means of managing interest rate risk 
our asset liability management process is utilized to manage our interest rate risk 
the measurement of interest rate risk associated with financial instruments is meaningful only when all related and offsetting on and off balance sheet transactions are aggregated  and the resulting net positions are identified 
our interest rate risk exposure is actively managed with the objective of managing the level and potential volatility of net interest income in addition to the long term growth of equity  bearing in mind that we will always be in the business of taking on rate risk and that rate risk immunization is not entirely possible 
also  it is recognized that as exposure to interest rate risk is reduced  so too may the overall level of net interest income and equity 
in general  the assets and liabilities generated through ordinary business activities do not naturally create offsetting positions with respect to repricing or maturity characteristics 
access to the derivatives market can be an important element in maintaining our interest rate risk position within policy guidelines 
using derivative instruments  principally interest rate floors  caps  and interest rate swaps  the interest rate sensitivity of specific transactions  as well as pools of assets or liabilities  is adjusted to maintain the desired interest rate risk profile 
see loan portfolio interest rate caps and floors borrowings interest rate caps and floors and notes and to the consolidated financial statements included under item for a summary of our accounting policies pertaining to such instruments 
our primary tool for measuring and managing interest rate risk is net interest income simulation 
this exercise includes our assumptions regarding the level of interest rates and their impact on our current balance sheet 
interest rate caps and floors are included to the extent that they are exercised in the month simulation period 
additionally  changes in prepayment behavior of the residential mortgage  cmos  and mortgage backed securities portfolios in each rate environment are captured using industry estimates of prepayment speeds for various coupon segments of the portfolio 
for purposes of this simulation  projected month end balances of the various balance sheet accounts are held constant at their december  levels 
cash flows from a given account are reinvested back into the same account so as to keep the month end balance constant at its december  level 
the static balance sheet assumption is made so as to project the interest rate risk to net interest income embedded in the existing balance sheet 
with knowledge of the balance sheet s existing net interest income profile  more informed strategies and tactics may be developed as it relates to the structure mix of growth 
we monitor the results of net interest income simulation on a quarterly basis at regularly scheduled alco meetings 
each quarter net interest income is generally simulated for the upcoming month horizon in seven interest scenarios 
the scenarios generally modeled are parallel interest ramps of bp  bp  and bp along with a rates unchanged scenario 
the parallel movement of interest rates means all projected market interest rates move up or down by the same amount 
a ramp in interest rates means that the projected change in market interest rates occurs over the month horizon on a pro rata basis 
for example  in the bp scenario  the projected prime rate will increase from its starting point at december  of percent to percent months later 
the prime rate in this example will increase th of the overall increase of basis points each month 
as the yield curve flattened over the course of with short term rates increasing more than long term rates  the parallel movement of interest rates takes the level of the year us treasury note yield in the bp scenario to percent 
this is nearly bp below the june  low for the year us treasury note yield of percent 
therefore  the level of mortgage prepayment activity built into the model is significantly greater than the record levels experienced during the lows in mortgage rates 
the net interest income simulation result for the month horizon that covers the calendar year of is shown below see notes and to the consolidated financial statements included under item of part ii for further discussion related to our interest rate caps and accounting policies related to these derivative instruments 
net interest income simulation amounts in thousands movement in interest rates bp bp bp unchanged bp bp bp projected month net interest income dollar change from unchanged scenario percentage change from unchanged scenario policy guidelines decline limited to our rate sensitivity position over the projected month horizon is asset sensitive 
this is evidenced by the projected increase in net interest income in the rising interest rate scenarios and projected decrease in net interest income in the declining rate scenarios 
our general policy is to limit the percentage decrease in projected net interest income to   and percent from the rates unchanged scenario for the bp  bp  and bp interest rate ramp scenarios  respectively 
when a given scenario falls outside of these limits  such as is the case with the bp and bp scenarios above  the alco reviews the circumstances surrounding the exception and  considering the level of net interest income generated in the scenario and other related factors  may approve the exception to the general policy or recommend actions aimed at bringing the respective scenario within the general limits noted above 
a targeted level of net interest income is established and approved by the board and alco 
this target is reevaluated and reset as appropriate at each quarterly alco meeting 
static gap analysis is another tool that may be used for interest rate risk measurement 
the net differences between the amount of assets  liabilities  equity and off balance sheet instruments repricing within a cumulative calendar period is typically referred to as the rate sensitivity position or gap position 
the following table sets forth our rate sensitivity position as of december  assets and liabilities are classified by the earliest possible repricing date or maturity  whichever occurs first interest sensitivity gap analysis estimated maturity or repricing at december  months months years over years total dollars in thousands interest earning assets interest bearing deposits with banks investment securities frb and fhlb stock loans held for sale  fixed rate loans held for sale  floating rate loans held for investment  fixed rate loans held for investment  floating rate total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities interest checking and money market accounts savings time deposits under  time deposits  and over short term borrowings fhlb advances long term borrowings subordinated debentures total interest bearing liabilities interest rate gap cumulative interest rate gap at december  cumulative interest rate gap to total assets a investment securities are generally reported in the timeframe representing the earliest of repricing date  call date for callable securities  estimated life or maturity date 
estimated lives of mortgage backed securities and cmos are based on published industry prepayment estimates for securities with comparable weighted average interest rates and contractual maturities 
b loans are stated gross of the allowance for credit losses and are placed in the earliest timeframe in which maturity or repricing may occur 
the table assumes that all savings and interest bearing demand deposits reprice in the earliest period presented  however  we believe a significant portion of these accounts constitute a core component and are generally not rate sensitive 
our position is supported by the fact that aggressive reductions in interest rates paid on these deposits historically have not caused notable reductions in balances 
the table does not necessarily indicate the future impact of general interest rate movements on our net interest income because the repricing of certain assets and liabilities is discretionary and is subject to competitive and other pressures 
as a result  assets and liabilities indicated as repricing within the same period may in fact reprice at different times and at different rate levels 
static gap analysis does not fully capture the impact of embedded options  lagged interest rate changes  administered interest rate products  or certain off balance sheet sensitivities to interest rate movements 
therefore  this tool generally cannot be used in isolation to determine the level of interest rate risk exposure in banking institutions 
since there are limitations inherent in any methodology used to estimate the exposure to changes in market interest rates  these analyses are not intended to be a forecast of the actual effect of changes in market interest rates such as those indicated above on the company 
further  these analyses are based on our assets and liabilities as of december  and do not contemplate any actions we might undertake in response to changes in market interest rates
