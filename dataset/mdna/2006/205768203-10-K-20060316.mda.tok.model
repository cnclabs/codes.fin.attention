item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our selected historical consolidated financial data and our accompanying consolidated financial statements and the notes to those financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
the following discussion includes forward looking statements that reflect our plans  estimates and beliefs 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed below and elsewhere in this report  particularly in risk factors and cautionary note regarding forward looking statements 
overview we are an independent energy company engaged in the acquisition  discovery and production of oil and natural gas in the united states 
we own interests in  net to us producing onshore oil and natural gas wells and we operate of these wells 
we also own of the common stock of bois d arc energy  inc  an independent exploration company which owns interests in offshore producing oil and natural gas wells in the gulf of mexico 
in managing our business  we are concerned primarily with maximizing return on our stockholders equity 
to accomplish this goal  we focus on profitably increasing our oil and natural gas reserves and production 
our future growth will be driven primarily by acquisition  development and exploration activities 
under our current drilling budget  we plan to spend approximately million in for development and exploration activities 
we plan to drill approximately development wells  net to us and exploratory wells  net to us 
however  the number of wells that we drill in will be subject to the availability of drilling rigs that we can hire 
in addition  we could reduce the wells that we drill if oil and natural gas prices were to decline significantly 
we do not budget for acquisitions as the timing and size of acquisitions are not predictable 
we use the successful efforts method of accounting which allows only for the capitalization of costs associated with developing proven oil and natural gas properties as well as exploration costs associated with successful exploration activities 
accordingly  our exploration costs consist of costs we incur to acquire and reprocess d seismic data  impairments of our unevaluated leasehold where we were not successful in discovering reserves and the costs of unsuccessful exploratory wells that we drill 
we generally sell our oil and natural gas at current market prices at the point our wells connect to third party purchaser pipelines 
we market our products several different ways depending upon a number of factors  including the availability of purchasers for the product  the availability and cost of pipelines near our wells  market prices  pipeline constraints and operational flexibility 
accordingly  our revenues are heavily dependent upon the prices of  and demand for  oil and natural gas 
oil and natural gas prices have historically been volatile and are likely to remain volatile in the future 
our revenues for benefited from a general increase in oil and natural gas prices 
we have entered into certain derivative instruments on approximately of our anticipated natural gas sales in to reduce an exposure to natural gas price risk 
we may in the future enter into additional arrangements in order to 
table of contents reduce our exposure to price risks 
such arrangements may also limit our ability to benefit from increases in oil and natural gas prices 
our operating costs are generally comprised of several components  including costs of field personnel  repair and maintenance costs  production supplies  fuel used in operations  transportation costs  workover expenses and state production and ad valorem taxes 
like all oil and natural gas exploration and production companies  we face the challenge of replacing our reserves 
although in the past we have offset the effect of declining production rates from existing properties through successful acquisition and drilling efforts  there can be no assurance that we will be able to offset production declines or maintain production at rates through future acquisitions or drilling activity 
our future growth will depend on our ability to continue to add new reserves in excess of production 
our operations and facilities are subject to extensive federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the exploration for  and the development  production and transportation of  oil and natural gas  and operating safety 
future laws or regulations  any adverse changes in the interpretation of existing laws and regulations or our failure to comply with existing legal requirements may harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
applicable environmental regulations require us to remove our equipment after production has ceased  to plug and abandon our wells and to remediate any environmental damage our operations may have caused 
the present value of the estimated future costs to plug and abandon our oil and gas wells and to dismantle and remove our production facilities is included in our reserve for future abandonment costs  which was million as of december  investment in bois d arc energy bois d arc energy was organized in july as a limited liability company through the contribution of substantially all of our offshore properties together with the properties of bois d arc resources  ltd 
and its partners 
we initially owned of bois d arc energy  and we accounted for our share of bois d arc energy s financial and operating results using proportionate consolidation accounting until bois d arc energy was converted into a corporation and completed its initial public offering in may subsequent to the conversion into a corporation and as a result of the public offering  we now own of the outstanding shares of bois d arc energy 
since proportionate consolidation is not a generally accepted accounting principle applicable to an investment in a corporation  we changed our accounting method for our investment in bois d arc energy to the equity method concurrent with bois d arc energy s conversion to a corporation 
the onshore data in the tables below contains the results of operations for our direct ownership in our onshore oil and gas properties 
the offshore results for include our proportionate interest in the operations of bois d arc energy based upon our ownership interest throughout the periods presented 
the equity method adjustments reflect the reductions to our share of bois d arc energy s operating results that are necessary to apply the equity method of accounting for all periods subsequent to the conversion of bois d arc energy to corporation 
the results for offshore operations in and represent our direct ownership interests in offshore properties that were ultimately contributed to bois d arc energy upon its formation and our proportionate consolidation of the results of bois d arc energy from its inception through december

table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  oil and gas sales 
our oil and gas sales increased million in to million from million in oil and gas sales from our onshore operations increased to million  an increase of million or  from million in this increase is attributable to the higher oil and gas prices we realized and increased production from our onshore properties 
our average onshore natural gas price increased by and our average onshore crude oil price increased by in as compared to prices in our onshore production increased by in over primarily due to new production from our successful drilling activity and the additional production attributable to the properties we acquired from ensight in may sales from our offshore operations of million in were higher than offshore revenues in of million as higher oil and gas prices realized were offset by lower production 
our average offshore natural gas price increased by and our average crude oil price increased by in as compared to prices in offshore production in decreased by from production in the lower offshore production was primarily attributable to the hurricane activity in the gulf of mexico that occurred during the third and fourth quarters of and partially to our lower ownership interest in bois d arc energy subsequent to the completion of its initial public offering on may  oil and gas operating expenses 
our oil and gas operating expenses  including production taxes  decreased million to million in from million in oil and gas operating expenses per equivalent mcf produced increased to in as compared with in onshore operating expenses for of million increased by million compared to due to the acquisition of the ensight properties  the start up of new wells and higher production taxes due to increased oil and gas prices 
offshore oil and gas operating costs for of million decreased million due to our lower ownership interest in certain high lifting cost fields that were contributed to bois d arc energy 
exploration expense 
in  we incurred million in exploration expense as compared to million in exploration expense in primarily relates to the exploratory dry hole drilled to test the big sandy prospect and the acquisition of d seismic data 
dd a 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a decreased million to million in from million in dd a associated with our onshore properties increased by million to million primarily due to our increased production and an increase in our amortization rate 
our dd a rate per mcfe produced for our onshore properties averaged in as compared to for the increase relates to higher costs of properties acquired in late and in together with an increase in capitalized costs on our existing properties 
dd a attributable to our offshore properties for declined primarily due to lower produced volumes 
our dd a rate per mcfe produced for offshore properties was essentially unchanged in from impairment 
we recorded impairments to our oil and gas properties of million in and million in these impairments relate to minor valued fields where an impairment was indicated based on estimated future cash flows attributable to the fields estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses  which are reported net of overhead reimbursements  of million for were higher than general and administrative expenses of million for the increase primarily reflects higher personnel costs in and additional staffing that was necessitated by the ensight acquisition 
interest income 
interest income in was million as compared to million in included in interest income was million in and million in related to interest received from the other owners of bois d arc energy 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased million to million in from million in the decrease was primarily the result of lower borrowings in average borrowings under our bank credit facility decreased to million in as compared to million for the average interest rate on the outstanding borrowings under our credit facility increased to in as compared to in 
table of contents equity in earnings 
commencing may  we began accounting for our share of the earnings from bois d arc energy under the equity method on an after tax basis 
accordingly  our results for include a loss of million with respect to our ownership interest in bois d arc energy 
this loss includes a one time provision of million associated with recognizing  under the equity method of accounting  our proportionate share of the cumulative deferred tax liabilities recorded by bois d arc energy when it converted from a limited liability company to a corporation 
we also recognized a gain of million on our investment in bois d arc energy based on our share of the amount that bois d arc energy s equity increased as a result of the sale of shares in bois d arc energy s initial public offering 
derivative losses 
the fair value of the liability for the derivatives we utilize as part of our natural gas price risk management program increased substantially during due to the increase in natural gas prices that occurred in the last four months of since we did not designate these derivative positions as hedges  an unrealized loss of million associated with the increase in fair value of these derivative positions was recorded as an expense during we realized losses of million in to settle derivative positions 
net income 
we reported net income of million in  as compared to net income of million in net income per share for was on million weighted average diluted shares outstanding as compared to for on million weighted average diluted shares outstanding 
excluding the effect of the one time adjustments for bois d arc energy s conversion to a corporation and its initial public offering and the unrealized loss on derivatives  our net income for would have been million or per share 
the results include a charge of million million after income taxes or per diluted share relating to the early retirement of our senior notes 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  oil and gas sales 
our oil and gas sales increased million or in to million from million in the increase in sales was mostly due to higher natural gas and crude oil prices  which was partially offset by a decrease in our oil and natural gas production in our average natural gas price increased by and our average oil price increased by 
on an equivalent unit basis  our average price received for our production in was per mcfe  which was higher than our average price in of per mcfe 
our natural gas production decreased by and our oil production decreased by 
the decrease in production primarily due to the disruption to bois d arc energy s production operations caused by hurricane ivan 
approximately bcfe of production was deferred in because of shut ins due to the hurricane 
oil and gas operating expenses 
our oil and gas operating expenses  including production taxes  increased million to million in from million in oil and gas operating expenses per equivalent mcf produced increased to in from in the increase in operating expenses is due primarily to higher production and ad valorem taxes resulting from the higher oil and gas prices in and the lower production volumes due to the deferred production during september in the gulf of mexico  which was shut in due to hurricane activity 
in addition  operating expenses in include million for repairs resulting from damage caused by the hurricane activity in the gulf of mexico 
exploration expense 
in  we incurred million in exploration expense as compared to million in the expense primarily relates to five exploratory dry holes drilled by bois d arc energy in the gulf of mexico together with six exploratory dry holes drilled in our south texas region 
dd a 
dd a increased million to million in from million in dd a per equivalent mcf produced for was  as compared to for the higher dd a rates are attributable to increased capitalized costs of our properties 
impairment 
we recorded impairments to our oil and gas properties of million in and million in these impairments relate to some minor valued fields where an impairment was indicated based on estimated future cash flows attributable to the fields estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses  which are reported net of overhead reimbursements  of million for were million higher than general and administrative expenses of million for the increase is primarily related to stock based compensation expense that we 
table of contents recorded in of million  resulting from our adoption of a fair value based method of accounting for employee stock based compensation including our employee stock options on january  the remaining increase is a result of higher personnel costs in and higher professional fees related to the increased compliance costs 
interest income 
our interest income in was million as compared to million in included in interest income in was million related to interest paid by the other owners of bois d arc energy to us 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased million to million in from million in the decrease is related to the early retirement of million of principal amount of our senior notes which were refinanced with million new senior notes along with the borrowings under a new bank credit facility 
the refinancing of our senior notes reduced our interest expense by million on an annual basis 
our average borrowings outstanding under our bank credit facility increased to million in as compared to million in the average interest rate on the outstanding borrowings under the bank credit facility also increased to in as compared to in net income 
we reported net income of million in as compared to net income of million in net income per share for was on weighted average diluted shares outstanding of million as compared to for on weighted average diluted shares outstanding of million 
the results include a charge of million per diluted share relating to the early retirement of our senior notes 
the results also include a charge of million related to the formation of bois d arc energy 
net income for included million in income per share related to the cumulative effect of a change in our accounting for future abandonment cost for our oil and gas properties 
liquidity and capital resources funding for our activities has historically been provided by our operating cash flow  debt or equity financings or asset dispositions 
in  our net cash flow provided by operating activities totaled million 
our other primary sources of funds in were the proceeds from a public offering of our common stock of million and borrowings of million under our bank credit facility 
in  our net cash flow provided by operating activities totaled million and we received proceeds of million from a sale of new eight year senior notes 
in we also increased the debt outstanding under our bank credit facility by million 
our primary needs for capital  in addition to funding our ongoing operations  relate to the acquisition  development and exploration of our oil and gas properties and the repayment of our debt 
in  we incurred capital expenditures of million for our acquisition  development and exploration activities 
we also repaid million of our debt  made advances to bois d arc energy in the aggregate amount of million and received repayment of million for outstanding indebtedness owed to us by bois d arc energy 
in  we incurred capital expenditures of million primarily for our development and exploration activities 
in we also retired our senior notes and we loaned bois d arc energy million 

table of contents our annual capital expenditure activity is summarized in the following table year ended december  in thousands onshore acquisitions of proved oil and gas properties acquisitions of unproved oil and gas properties developmental leasehold costs workovers and recompletions development drilling exploratory drilling offshore other total includes all capital expenditures for offshore operations  including our proportionate share of bois d arc energy s capital expenditures from july  through december  and from january  through may  the timing of most of our capital expenditures is discretionary because we have no material long term capital expenditure commitments 
consequently  we have a significant degree of flexibility to adjust the level of our capital expenditures as circumstances warrant 
we spent million  million and million on development and exploration activities in  and  respectively 
we have budgeted approximately million for development and exploration projects in we expect to use internally generated cash flow to fund development and exploration activity 
our operating cash flow is highly dependent on oil and natural gas prices  and in particular natural gas prices 
in we acquired producing oil and gas properties in texas  louisiana and mississippi in two acquisitions for an aggregate amount of million 
we spent million and million on acquisition activities in and  respectively 
we do not have a specific acquisition budget for since the timing and size of acquisitions are unpredictable 
smaller acquisitions will generally be funded from operating cash flows 
with respect to significant acquisitions  we intend to use borrowings under our bank credit facility  or other debt or equity financings to the extent available  to finance such acquisitions 
the availability and attractiveness of these sources of financing will depend upon a number of factors  some of which will relate to our financial condition and performance and some of which will be beyond our control  such as prevailing interest rates  oil and natural gas prices and other market conditions 
we have million of senior notes outstanding 
the senior notes are due march  and bear interest at  which is payable semiannually on each march and september the senior notes are unsecured obligations and are guaranteed by all of our subsidiaries 
we also have a million bank credit facility with bank of montreal  as the administrative agent 
the bank credit facility is a four year revolving credit commitment that matures on february  indebtedness under the bank credit facility is secured by substantially all of our and our subsidiaries assets and is guaranteed by all of our subsidiaries 
the bank credit facility is subject to borrowing base availability  which is redetermined semiannually based on the banks estimates of the future net cash flows of our oil and natural gas properties 
as of december  the borrowing base was million 
the borrowing base may be affected by the performance of our properties and changes in oil and natural gas prices 
the determination of the borrowing base is at the sole discretion of the administrative agent and the bank group 
borrowings under the bank credit facility bear interest  based on the utilization of the borrowing base  at our option at either libor plus to or the base rate which is the higher of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus to 
a commitment fee of is payable on the unused portion of the borrowing base 
the bank credit facility contains covenants that  among other things  restrict the payment of cash dividends  limit the amount of consolidated debt 
table of contents that we may incur and limit our ability to make certain loans and investments 
the only financial covenants are the maintenance of a current ratio and maintenance of a minimum tangible net worth 
we were in compliance with these covenants as of december  in connection with the formation of bois d arc energy  we made available to bois d arc energy a revolving line of credit in a maximum outstanding amount of million 
this line of credit was paid off in full and terminated in connection with bois d arc energy s initial public offering 
we believe that our cash flow from operations and available borrowings under our bank credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operations and future growth as contemplated under our current business plan 
however  if our plans or assumptions change or if our assumptions prove to be inaccurate  we may be required to seek additional capital 
we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to obtain such capital  or if such capital is available  that we will be able to obtain it on acceptable terms 
the following table summarizes our aggregate liabilities and commitments by year of maturity thereafter total in thousands bank credit facility senior notes interest on debt operating leases contracted drilling services federal taxation at december   we had federal income tax net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million 
we have established a million valuation allowance against part of the net operating loss carryforwards that we acquired in an acquisition due to a change in control limitation which will prevent us from fully realizing these carryforwards 
the carryforwards expire from through the value of these carryforwards depends on our ability to generate future taxable income in order to utilize these carryforwards 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and use assumptions that can affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues or expenses 
successful efforts accounting 
we are required to select among alternative acceptable accounting policies 
there are two generally acceptable methods for accounting for oil and gas producing activities 
the full cost method allows the capitalization of all costs associated with finding oil and natural gas reserves  including certain general and administrative expenses 
the successful efforts method allows only for the capitalization of costs associated with developing proven oil and natural gas properties as well as exploration costs associated with successful exploration projects 
costs related to exploration that are not successful are expensed when it is determined that commercially productive oil and gas reserves were not found 
we have elected to use the successful efforts method to account for our oil and gas activities and we do not capitalize any of our general and administrative expenses 
oil and natural gas reserve quantities 
the determination of depreciation  depletion and amortization expense as well as impairments that are recognized on our oil and gas properties are highly dependent on the estimates of the proved oil and natural gas reserves attributable to our properties 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be precisely measured 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate depends on the quality of available data  production history and engineering and 
table of contents geological interpretation and judgment 
because all reserve estimates are to some degree imprecise  the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered  production and operating costs  the amount and timing of future development expenditures and future oil and natural gas prices may all differ materially from those assumed in these estimates 
the information regarding present value of the future net cash flows attributable to our proved oil and natural gas reserves are estimates only and should not be construed as the current market value of the estimated oil and natural gas reserves attributable to our properties 
thus  such information includes revisions of certain reserve estimates attributable to proved properties included in the preceding year s estimates 
such revisions reflect additional information from subsequent activities  production history of the properties involved and any adjustments in the projected economic life of such properties resulting from changes in product prices 
any future downward revisions could adversely affect our financial condition  our borrowing ability  our future prospects and the value of our common stock 
impairment of oil and gas properties 
the determination of impairment of our oil and gas reserves is based on the oil and gas reserve estimates using projected future oil and natural gas prices that we have determined to be reasonable 
the projected prices that we employ represent our long term oil and natural gas price forecast and may be higher or lower than the december  market prices for crude oil and natural gas 
for the impairment review of our oil and gas properties that we conducted as of december   we used oil and natural gas prices that were based on the current futures market 
we used oil prices of  and per barrel for  and  respectively  and escalated prices by each year thereafter to a maximum price of per barrel 
for natural gas we used prices of  and per mcf for  and  respectively  and escalated prices by each year thereafter to a maximum price of per mcf 
to the extent we had used lower prices in our impairment review  an impairment could have been indicated on certain of our oil and gas properties 
accounting for asset retirement obligations 
we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas accounting for asset retirement obligations  on january  this statement requires us to record a liability in the period in which an asset retirement obligation aro is incurred  in an amount equal to the discounted estimated fair value of the obligation that is capitalized 
thereafter  each quarter  this liability is accreted up to the final retirement cost 
the adoption of sfas on january  resulted in a cumulative effect adjustment to record i a million decrease in the carrying value of our oil and gas properties  ii a million decrease in accumulated depreciation  depletion and amortization  iii a million decrease in reserve for future abandonment  and iv a loss of  which was reflected as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
the determination of our asset retirement obligations is based on our estimate of the future cost to plug and abandon our oil and gas wells and to dismantle and dispose of our offshore production facilities 
the actual costs could be higher or lower than our current estimates 
stock based compensation 
prior to january   we accounted for employee stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
under the intrinsic method  compensation cost for stock options is measured as the excess  if any  of the fair value of our common stock at the date of the grant over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the common stock 
effective january   we changed our method of accounting for employee stock based compensation to the preferable fair value based method prescribed in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
under the fair value based method  compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized over the award vesting period 
we determine the fair value of each stock option at the date of grant using the black scholes options pricing model 
under the modified prospective transition method selected by us as described in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  stock based compensation expense recognized for  is the same as that which would have been recognized had the fair value method of sfas been applied from its original effective date 
accordingly  our general and administrative expenses included million and million in stock based compensation in and  respectively 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  results for years prior to were not restated 
for years prior to  no compensation cost was recognized for our employee stock options 
if compensation costs had been determined in accordance with sfas  we would have recorded an additional compensation expense of million in 
table of contents included in our and stock based compensation expense was million and million  respectively  attributable to our ownership in bois d arc energy 
in connection with its formation  bois d arc energy established a long term incentive plan to provide for equity based compensation for its executive officers  employees and consultants 
the awards made under this plan were comprised of either options to purchase class b llc units or restricted class c llc units  representing solely a profits interest 
all of the awards made under the bois d arc energy incentive plan vest over a five year period 
at the time of its formation  bois d arc energy granted options to purchase a total of  class b units at an exercise price of per unit and  restricted class c units 
in determining the fair value of the class b units and class c units underlying the equity awards granted  bois d arc energy used a valuation methodology that it believes is consistent with the practices recommended by the aicpa audit and accounting practice aid series  valuation of privately held company equity securities issued as compensation the practice aid 
bois d arc energy reviewed the guidance set forth in the practice aid and performed a retrospective valuation on a top down basis  using an enterprise valuation model 
bois d arc energy determined the fair value of the entity and then allocated the enterprise value to the various classes of member units 
bois d arc energy also consulted with an independent valuation specialist regarding the methods and procedures used to determine  on a retrospective basis  the fair value of the class b units and the class c units at the time of issuance 
the valuation conducted determined that the fair value of a class b unit at the date of the issuance was per unit 
the fair value of a class c unit was determined to be per unit 
the fair value of each option awarded under the incentive plan was estimated using the black scholes option pricing model and determined to be per option 
new accounting standards 
on december   the fasb issued statement revised  share based payment sfas r that requires compensation costs related to share based payment transactions issuance of stock options and restricted stock to be recognized in the financial statements 
with limited exceptions  the amount of compensation cost is to be measured based on the grant date fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
compensation cost is recognized over the period that an employee provides service in exchange for the award 
statement r replaces sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb sfas r is effective for the first reporting period after june  entities that use the fair value based method for either recognition or disclosure under sfas are required to apply sfas r using a modified version of prospective application whereby the entity is required to record compensation expense for all awards it grants after the date of adoption and the unvested portion of previously granted awards that remain outstanding at the date of adoption 
effective january   we adopted the fair value based measure as proscribed in sfas using the modified prospective application 
therefore  sfas r will not have a significant impact on us 
related party transactions in recent years  we have not entered into any material transactions with our officers or directors apart from the compensation they are provided for their services 
we also have not entered into any business transactions with our significant stockholders or any other related parties 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s oil and natural gas prices our financial condition  results of operations and capital resources are highly dependent upon the prevailing market prices of oil and natural gas 
these commodity prices are subject to wide fluctuations and market uncertainties due to a variety of factors that are beyond our control 
factors influencing oil and natural gas prices include the level of global demand for crude oil  the foreign supply of oil and natural gas  the establishment of and compliance with production quotas by oil exporting countries  weather conditions which determine the demand for natural gas  the price and availability of alternative fuels and overall economic conditions 
it is impossible to predict future oil and natural gas prices with any degree of certainty 
sustained weakness in oil and natural gas prices may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations  and may also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas reserves that we can produce economically 
any reduction in our oil and natural gas reserves  including reductions due to price fluctuations  can have an adverse affect on our ability to obtain capital for our exploration and development activities 
similarly  any improvements in oil and natural gas prices can have a favorable impact 
table of contents on our financial condition  results of operations and capital resources 
based on our oil and natural gas production in  a change in the price per barrel of oil would have resulted in a change in our cash flow for such period by approximately million and a change in the price per mcf of natural gas would have changed our cash flow by approximately million 
we periodically use derivative transactions with respect to a portion of our oil and natural gas production to mitigate our exposure to price changes 
we realized million in losses in related to our derivatives held for natural gas price risk management 
while the use of these derivative arrangements limits the downside risk of price declines  such use may also limit any benefits which may be derived from price increases 
we use swaps  floors and collars to hedge oil and natural gas prices 
swaps are settled monthly based on differences between the prices specified in the instruments and the settlement prices of futures contracts quoted on the new york mercantile exchange 
generally  when the applicable settlement price is less than the price specified in the contract  we receive a settlement from the counterparty based on the difference multiplied by the volume hedged 
similarly  when the applicable settlement price exceeds the price specified in the contract  we pay the counterparty based on the difference 
we generally receive a settlement from the counterparty for floors when the applicable settlement price is less than the price specified in the contract  which is based on the difference multiplied by the volumes hedged 
for collars  we generally receive a settlement from the counterparty when the settlement price is below the floor and pay a settlement to the counterparty when the settlement price exceeds the cap 
no settlement occurs when the settlement price falls between the floor and the cap 
the following table sets forth the derivative financial instruments which relate to our natural gas production volume type of floor ceiling period beginning period ending mmbtu delivery location instrument price price january  december   henry hub collar january  december   houston ship channel collar the fair market value of these derivative financial instruments at december  was a liability of million 
we did not designate these instruments as cash flow hedges and  accordingly  recognized unrealized losses on derivatives of million in to reflect the change in these liabilities 
interest rates at december   we had long term debt of million 
of this amount  million bears interest at a fixed rate of 
the fair market value of the fixed rate debt as of december  was million based on the market price of of the face amount 
at december   we had million outstanding under our bank credit facility  which was subject to floating market rates of interest 
borrowings under the bank credit facility bear interest at a fluctuating rate that is tied to libor or the corporate base rate  at our option 
any increases in these interest rates can have an adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flow 
based on borrowings outstanding at december   a basis point change in interest rates would change our interest expense on our variable rate debt by approximately million 
we had no interest rate derivatives outstanding during or at december
