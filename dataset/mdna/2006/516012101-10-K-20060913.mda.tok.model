part i item description of business general lannett company  inc the company  lannett  we  or us was incorporated in under the laws of the commonwealth of pennsylvania  and reincorporated in as a delaware corporation 
we develop  manufacture  market and distribute generic versions of pharmaceutical products 
the company reports financial information on a fiscal year basis  the most recent being the fiscal year ended june  all references herein to a fiscal year refer to the company s fiscal year ending june the company is focused on increasing our share of the generic pharmaceutical market 
we were able to increase net sales and operating income during fiscal by adding new products  as well as by improved results from existing distribution agreements 
the company plans to continue to focus on improved financial performance though additions to our line of generic products  additional sales to current customers  higher unit sales  and a focus on minimizing overhead and administrative costs 
some of the new generic products sold by lannett were developed and are manufactured by lannett while others are manufactured by others 
the products manufactured by lannett and those manufactured by others are identified in the section entitled products in item of this form k 
over the past several years  lannett has consistently devoted resources to research and development r d projects  including new generic product offerings 
the costs of these r d efforts are expensed during the periods incurred 
the company believes that such investments may be recovered in future years as it submits applications to the food and drug administration fda  and when it receives marketing approval from the 
table of contents fda to distribute such products 
in addition to using cash generated from its operations  the company has entered into a number of financing agreements with third parties to provide for additional cash when it is needed 
these financing agreements are more fully described in the section entitled liquidity and capital resources in item of this form k 
the company has embarked on an industrious plan to grow in future years 
in addition to organic growth to be achieved through its own r d efforts  the company has also initiated marketing projects with other companies in order to expand future revenue projections 
the company expects that its growing list of generic drugs under development will drive future growth 
the company also intends to use the infrastructure it has created  and to continually devote resources to additional r d projects 
the following strategies highlight lannett s plan research and development process there are numerous stages in the generic drug development process formulation and analytical method development after a drug candidate is selected for future sales  product development chemists perform various experiments on the incorporation of active ingredients into a dosage form 
these experiments will result in the creation of a number of product formulations to determine which formula will be most suitable for the company s subsequent development process 
various formulations are tested in the laboratory to measure results against the innovator drug 
during this time  the company may use reverse engineering methods on samples of the innovator drug to determine the type and quantity of inactive ingredients 
during the formulation phase  the company s research and development chemists begin to develop an analytical  laboratory testing method 
the successful development of this test method will allow the company to test developmental and commercial batches of the product in the future 
all of the information used in the final formulation  including the analytical test methods adopted for the generic drug candidate  will be included as part of the chemical  manufacturing and controls section of the abbreviated new drug application anda submitted to the fda in the generic drug application scale up after the product development scientists and the r d chemists agree on a final formulation to use in moving the drug candidate forward in the developmental process  the company will attempt to increase the batch size of the product 
the batch size represents the standard magnitude to be used in manufacturing a batch of the product 
the determination of batch size will affect the amount of raw material that is input into the manufacturing process and the number of expected tablets or capsules to be created during the production cycle 
the company attempts to determine batch size based on the amount of active ingredient in each dosage  the available production equipment and unit sales projections 
the scaled up batch is then generally produced in the company s commercial manufacturing facilities 
during this manufacturing process  the company will document the equipment used  the amount of time in each major processing step and any other steps needed to consistently produce a batch of that product 
this information  generally referred to as the validated manufacturing process  will be included in the company s generic drug application submitted to the fda 
clinical testing after a successful scale up of the generic drug batch  the company then schedules and performs clinical testing procedures on the product if required by the fda 
these procedures  which are generally outsourced to third parties  include testing the absorption of the generic product in the human bloodstream compared to the absorption of the innovator drug 
the results of this testing are then documented and reported to the company to determine the success of the generic drug product 
success  in this context  means the successful comparison of the company s product related to the innovator product 
since bioequivalence and a stable formula are the primary requirements for a generic drug approval assuming the manufacturing plant is in compliance with the fda s good manufacturing quality standards  lengthy and costly clinical trials proving safety and efficacy  which are generally required by the fda for innovator drug approvals  are unnecessary for generic companies 
if the results are successful  the 
table of contents company will continue the collection of documentation and information for assembly of the drug application 
submission of the anda for fda review and approval the anda process became formalized under the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of  also known as the hatch waxman act hatch waxman act 
an anda represents a generic drug company s application to the fda to manufacture and or distribute a drug that is the generic equivalent to an already approved brand named innovator drug 
once bioequivalence studies are complete  the generic drug company submits an anda to the fda for marketing approval 
in a presentation to the generic pharmaceutical association on february   lester m 
crawford  dvm  dvm  and the acting commissioner of food and drugs at the fda  said that the median approval time for a new anda for the fda s fiscal year was months 
however  there is no guarantee that the fda will approve a company s anda or that any approval will be given within this time frame 
when a generic drug company files an anda with the fda  it must certify that no patents are listed in the orange book  the fda s reference listing of approved drugs  or listed patents have expired 
an anda filer must certify  with respect to each patent that claims the listed drug for the bioequivalent of which the anda filer is seeking approval  
fn either that no patent was filed for the listed drug a paragraph i certification  that the patent has expired a paragraph ii certification  that the patent will expire on a specified date and the anda filer will not market the drug until that date a paragraph iii certification  or that the patent is invalid or would not be infringed by the manufacture  use  or sale of the new drug a paragraph iv certification 
these legal activities can trigger an automatic month stay of the anda if the innovator company files a claim and it will delay the approval of the generic company s anda 
currently  lannett has no paragraph iv certifications in its andas 
over the past several years  the company has hired additional personnel in product development  production  formulation and the r d laboratory 
lannett believes that its ability to select appropriate products for development  develop such products on a timely basis  obtain fda approval  and achieve economies in production will be critical for its success in the generic industry 
the strategy involves a combination of decisions focusing on long term profitability and a secure market position with fewer challenges from competitors 
competition in generic pharmaceutical manufacturing will continue to grow as more pharmaceutical products lose patent protection 
however  the company believes that with strong technical know how  low overhead expenses  and efficient product development  manufacturing and marketing  it can remain competitive 
it is the intention of the company to reinvest as much capital as possible to develop new products since the success of any generic pharmaceutical manufacturer depends on its ability to continually introduce new generic products to the market 
over time  if a generic drug market for a specific product remains stable and consumer demand remains consistent  it is likely that additional generic manufacturing companies will pursue the generic product by developing it  submitting an anda  and potentially receiving marketing approval from the fda 
if this occurs  the generic competition for the drug increases  and a company s market share may drop 
in addition to reduced unit sales  the unit selling price may also drop due to the product s availability from additional suppliers 
this may have the effect of reducing a generic company s future net sales of the product 
due to these factors that may potentially affect a generic company s future results of operations  the ability to properly assess the competitive effect of new products  including market share  the number of competitors and the generic unit price erosion  is critical to a generic company s r d plan 
a generic company may be able to reduce the potential exposure to competitive influences that negatively affect its sales and profits by having several drug candidates in its r d pipeline 
as such  a generic company may be able to avoid becoming materially dependent on the sales of one drug 
please refer to the following section entitled products for more descriptive information on the products the company currently produces or sells 
unlike the branded  innovator companies  lannett currently does not own proprietary drug patents 
however  the typical intellectual property in the generic drug industry are the andas that generic drug companies own 

table of contents validated pharmaceutical capabilities lannett s manufacturing facility consists of  square feet on acres owned by the company 
in addition  the company owns a  square foot building located within mile of the corporate office 
the second building contains packaging  warehouse and shipping functions  r d and a number of administrative functions 
many fda regulations relating to current good manufacturing practices cgmp have been adopted by the company in the last several years 
in designing its facilities  full attention was given to material flow  equipment and automation  quality control and inspection 
a granulator  an automatic film coating machine  high speed tablet presses  blenders  encapsulators  fluid bed dryers  high shear mixers and high speed bottle filling are a few examples of the sophisticated product development  manufacturing and packaging equipment the company uses 
in addition  the company s quality control laboratory facilities are equipped with high precision instruments  like automated high pressure liquid chromatographs  gas chromatographs  robots and laser particle sizers 
lannett continues to pursue its comprehensive plan for improving and maintaining quality control and quality assurance programs for its pharmaceutical development and manufacturing facilities 
the fda periodically inspects the company s production facilities to determine the company s compliance with the fda s manufacturing standards 
typically  after the fda completes its inspection  it will issue the company a report  entitled a form  containing the fda s observations of possible violations of cgmp 
such observations may be minor or severe in nature 
the degree of severity of the observation is generally determined by the time necessary to remediate the cgmp violation  any consequences upon the consumer of the company s drug products  and whether the observation is subject to a warning letter from the fda 
by strictly enforcing the various fda guidelines  namely good laboratory practices  standard operating procedures and cgmp  the company has successfully kept the number of observations in its fda inspection at a minimal level 
the company believes that such observations are minor in nature  and will be remediated in a timely fashion with no material effect on its results of operations 
sales and customer relationships the company sells its pharmaceutical products to generic pharmaceutical distributors  drug wholesalers  chain drug retailers  private label distributors  mail order pharmacies  other pharmaceutical manufacturers  managed care organizations  hospital buying groups and health maintenance organizations 
it promotes its products through direct sales  trade shows  trade publications  and bids 
the company also licenses the marketing of its products to other manufacturers and or marketers in private label agreements 
the company continues to expand its sales to the major chain drug stores 
the mail order segment continued to be one of the fastest growing classes in the company s distribution efforts 
companies such as medco health  express scripts and caremark are leaders in sales growth in the pharmaceutical market 
lannett also increased distribution in the wholesaler segment led by cardinal health and mckesson corporation 
lannett is recognized by its customers as a dependable supplier of high quality generic pharmaceuticals 
the company s policy of maintaining an adequate inventory and fulfilling orders in a timely manner has contributed to this reputation 
management the company has been focused on increasing the size and quality of its management team in anticipation of continued growth 
managers from large  established  brand pharmaceutical companies as well as competing generic companies have been brought in to complement the skills and knowledge of the existing management team 
as the company continues to grow  additional managers may need to be added to the team 
we intend to hire the best people available to expand the knowledge and expertise within the company  in order to further accomplish specific company goals

additional products are currently under development 
these products are either orally administered  solid dosage products ie tablet capsule or oral solutions  topicals or parentarels designed to be generic equivalents to brand named innovator drugs 
the company s developmental drug products are intended to treat a diverse range of indications 
the products under development are at various stages in the development cycle formulation  scale up  clinical testing and fda review 
the cost associated with each product currently under development is dependent on numerous factors not limited to the following the complexity of the active ingredient s chemical characteristics  the price of the raw materials  the fda mandated requirement of bioequivalence studies depending on the fda s orange book classification and other developmental factors 
the overall cost to develop a new generic product varies in range from  to million 
in addition  as one of the oldest generic drug manufacturers in the country  formed in  lannett currently owns several andas for products which it does not manufacture and market 
these andas are simply dormant on the company s records 
occasionally  the company reviews such andas to determine if the market potential for any of these older drugs has recently changed  to make it attractive for lannett to reconsider manufacturing and selling them 
if the company makes the determination to introduce one of these products into the consumer marketplace  it must review the anda and related documentation to ensure that the approved product specifications  formulation and other factors meet current fda requirements for the marketing of that drug 
generally  in these situations  the company must file a supplement to the fda for the applicable anda  informing the fda of any significant changes in the manufacturing process  the formulation  the raw material supplier or another major feature of the previously approved anda 
the company would then redevelop the product and submit it to the fda for supplemental approval 
the fda s approval process for anda supplements is similar to that of a new anda 
in addition to the efforts of its internal product development group  lannett has contracted with several outside firms for the formulation and development of several new generic drug products 
these outsourced r d products are at various stages in the development cycle formulation  analytical method development and testing and manufacturing scale up 
these products are orally administered solid dosage products intended to treat a diverse range of medical indications 
it is the company s intention to ultimately transfer the formulation technology and manufacturing process for all of these r d products to the company s own commercial manufacturing sites 
the company initiated these outsourced r d efforts to complement the progress of its own internal r d efforts 
the majority of the company s r d projects are being developed in house under lannett s direct supervision and with company personnel 
hence  the company does not believe that its outside contracts for product development or manufacturing supply are material in nature  nor is the company substantially dependent on the services rendered by such outside firms 
since the company has no control over the fda review process  management is unable to anticipate whether or when it will be able to begin producing and shipping such additional products 

table of contents the following table summarizes key information related to the company s r d products 
the column headings are defined as follows stage of r d defines the current stage of the r d product in the development process  as of the date of this filing 
regulatory requirement defines whether the r d product is or is expected to be a new anda submission  an anda supplement  or a grand fathered product not requiring specific fda approval 
number of products defines the number of products in r d at the stage noted 
in this context  a product means any finished dosage form  including all potencies  containing the same api or combination of apis and which represents a generic version of the same reference listed drug rld or innovator drug  identified in the fda s orange book 
stage of r d regulatory requirement number of products fda review anda fda review anda supplement clinical testing anda scale up grand fathered scale up anda supplement scale up anda formulation method development anda raw materials and finished goods inventory suppliers the raw materials used by the company in the production process consist of pharmaceutical chemicals in various forms and are generally available from several sources 
fda approval is required in connection with the process of using most active ingredient suppliers 
in addition to the raw materials purchased for the production process  the company purchases certain finished dosage inventories  including capsule  tablet  and oral liquid products 
the company then sells these finished dosage products directly to its customers along with the finished dosage products internally manufactured 
if suppliers of a certain material or finished product are limited  the company will generally take certain precautionary steps to avoid a disruption in supply  such as finding a secondary supplier or ordering larger quantities 
the company s primary finished product inventory supplier is jerome stevens pharmaceuticals  inc jsp  in bohemia  new york 
purchases of finished goods inventory from jsp accounted for approximately of the company s inventory purchases in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal on march   the company entered into an agreement with jsp for the exclusive distribution rights in the united states to the current line of jsp products in exchange for four million  shares of the company s common stock 
the jsp products covered under the agreement included butalbital  aspirin  caffeine with codeine phosphate capsules  digoxin tablets and levothyroxine sodium tablets  sold generically and under the brand name unithroid 
the term of the agreement is ten years  beginning on march  and continuing through march  refer to the materials contract footnote to our consolidated financial statements for more information on the terms  conditions  and financial impact of this agreement 

table of contents during the term of the agreement  the company is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to purchase minimum dollar quantities of jsp s products being distributed by the company 
the minimum quantity to be purchased in the first year of the agreement was million 
thereafter  the minimum purchase quantity increases by million per year up to million for the last year of the ten year contract 
the company has met the minimum purchase requirement for the first two years of the contract  but there is no guarantee that the company will be able to continue to do so in the future 
if the company does not meet the minimum purchase requirements  jsp s sole remedy is to terminate the agreement 
in august  the company signed an agreement with a finished goods provider to purchase  at fixed prices  and distribute a certain generic pharmaceutical product in the united states 
purchases of finished goods inventory from this provider accounted for approximately of the company s costs of purchased inventory in fiscal the term of the agreement is three years  beginning on august  and continuing through august  during the term of the agreement  the company has committed to provide a rolling twelve month forecast of the estimated product requirements to this provider 
the first three months of the rolling twelve month forecast are binding and constitute a firm order 
in october  the company signed an agreement with orion pharma orion  based in finland  to purchase and distribute three drug products 
under the terms of the agreement  orion will supply lannett with the finished products and all laboratory documentation  and lannett will coordinate the completion of the clinical biostudies necessary to submit abbreviated new drug applications andas to the fda 
the company signed supply and development agreements with olive healthcare  of india  orion pharma  of finland  azad pharma ag  of switzerland  and is in negotiations with companies in israel and greece for similar new product initiatives  in which lannett will market and distribute products manufactured by third parties 
lannett intends to use its strong customer relationships to build its market share for such products  and increase future revenues and income 
the company has also contracted with an api provider for the supply of raw materials and oral dosage forms relating to future products 
the agreements are standard supply agreements evidencing the terms of the supply of material 
there are no guaranteed purchase volume commitments 
the price of the material may vary depending on the quantity of material purchased during the term of the agreement 
customers and marketing the company sells its products primarily to wholesale distributors  generic drug distributors  mail order pharmacies  group purchasing organizations  drug chains  and other pharmaceutical companies 
the industry s largest wholesale distributors mckesson  cardinal health  and amerisource bergen accounted for   and  respectively  of net sales in fiscal the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition  and has experienced no significant collection problems to date 
generally  the company requires no collateral from its customers 
sales to these wholesale customers include indirect sales  which represent sales to third party entities  such as independent pharmacies  managed care organizations  hospitals  nursing homes  and group purchasing organizations  collectively referred to as indirect customers 
lannett enters into agreements with its indirect customers to establish pricing for certain products 
the indirect customers then independently select a wholesaler from which to actually purchase the products at these agreed upon prices 
lannett will provide credit to the wholesaler for the difference between the agreed upon price with the indirect customer and the wholesaler s invoice price 
this credit is called a chargeback 
for more information on chargebacks  refer to the section entitled chargebacks in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this form k 
these indirect sale transactions are recorded on lannett s books as sales to the wholesale customers 
the company believes that retail level consumer demand dictates the total volume of sales for various products 
in the event that wholesale and retail customers adjust their purchasing volumes  the company 
table of contents believes that consumer demand will be fulfilled by other wholesale or retail sources of supply 
as such  lannett attempts to obtain strong relationships with most of the major retail chains  wholesale distributors  and mail order pharmacies in order to facilitate the supply of the company s products through whatever channel the consumer prefers 
although the company has agreements with customers governing the transaction terms of its sales  there are no minimum purchase quantities with these agreements 
the company promotes its products through direct sales  trade shows  trade publications  and bids 
the company also markets its products through private label arrangements  whereby lannett produces its products with a label containing the name and logo of a customer 
this practice is commonly referred to as private label business 
it allows the company to expand on its own internal sales efforts by using the marketing services from other well respected pharmaceutical dosage suppliers 
the focus of the company s sales efforts is the relationships it creates with its customer accounts 
strong customer relationships have created a positive platform for lannett to increase its sales volumes 
advertising in the generic pharmaceutical industry is generally limited to trade publications  read by retail pharmacists  wholesale purchasing agents and other pharmaceutical decision makers 
historically and in fiscal   and  the company s advertising expenses were immaterial 
when the customer and the company s sales representatives make contact  the company will generally offer to supply the customer its products at fixed prices 
if accepted  the customer s purchasing department will coordinate the purchase  receipt and distribution of the products throughout its distribution centers and retail outlets 
once a customer accepts the company s supply of product  the customer generally expects a high standard of service 
this service standard includes shipping product in a timely manner on receipt of customer purchase orders  maintaining convenient and effective customer service functions  and retaining a mutually beneficial dialogue of communication 
the company believes that although the generic pharmaceutical industry is a commodity industry  where price is the primary factor for sales success  these additional service standards are equally important to the customers that rely on a consistent source of supply 
competition the manufacture and distribution of generic pharmaceutical products is a highly competitive industry 
competition is based primarily on price  service and quality 
the company competes primarily on this basis  as well as by flexibility reacting to customer needs quickly and decisively for example shipping product via overnight delivery when the customer is in critical need of inventory  availability of inventory  and by the fact that the company s products are available only from a limited number of suppliers 
the modernization of its facilities  hiring of experienced staff  and implementation of inventory and quality control programs have improved the company s competitive position over the past five years 
the company competes with other manufacturers and marketers of generic and brand drugs 
each product manufactured and or sold by lannett has a different set of competitors 
the list below identifies the companies with which lannett primarily competes for each of its major products

the federal food  drug and cosmetic act  the controlled substance act  and other federal statutes and regulations govern or influence the testing  manufacture  safety  labeling  storage  record keeping  approval  pricing  advertising  and promotion of the company s generic drug products 
noncompliance with applicable regulations can result in fines  recall and seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production  personal and or corporate prosecution and debarment  and refusal of the government to approve new drug applications 
the fda also has the authority to revoke previously approved drug products 
generally  fda approval is required before a prescription drug can be marketed 
a new drug is one not generally recognized by qualified experts as safe and effective for its intended use 
new drugs are typically developed and submitted to the fda by companies expecting to brand the product and sell it as a new medical treatment 
the fda review process for new drugs is very extensive and requires a substantial investment to research and test the drug candidate 
however  less burdensome approval procedures may be used for generic equivalents 
typically  the investment required to develop a generic drug is less costly than the brand innovator drug 
there are currently three ways to obtain fda approval of a drug new drug applications nda unless one of the two procedures discussed in the following paragraphs is available  a manufacturer must conduct and submit to the fda complete clinical studies to establish a drug s safety and efficacy 
abbreviated new drug applications anda an anda is similar to an nda except that the fda generally waives the requirement of complete clinical studies of safety and efficacy 
however  it may require bioavailability and bioequivalence studies 
bioavailability indicates the rate of absorption and levels of concentration of a drug in the bloodstream needed to produce a therapeutic effect 

table of contents bioequivalence compares one drug product with another and indicates if the rate of absorption and the levels of concentration of a generic drug in the body are within prescribed statistical limits to those of a previously approved drug 
under the hatch waxman act  an anda may be submitted for a drug on the basis that it is the equivalent of an approved drug regardless of when such other drug was approved 
in addition to establishing a new anda procedure  this act created statutory protections for approved brand name drugs 
under the act  an anda for a generic drug may not be made effective until all relevant product and use patents for the brand name drug have expired or have been determined to be invalid 
prior to this act  the fda gave no consideration to the patent status of a previously approved drug 
additionally  the hatch waxman act extends for up to five years the term of a product or use patent covering a drug to compensate the patent holder for the reduction of the effective market life of a patent due to federal regulatory review 
with respect to certain drugs not covered by patents  the act sets specified time periods of two to ten years during which andas for generic drugs cannot become effective or  under certain circumstances  cannot be filed if the branded drug was approved after december  lannett  like most other generic drug companies  uses the anda process for the submission of its developmental generic drug candidates 
paper new drug applications paper nda for a drug that is identical to a drug first approved after  a prospective manufacturer need not go through the full nda procedure 
instead  it may demonstrate safety and efficacy by relying on published literature and reports 
the manufacturer must also submit  if the fda so requires  bioavailability or bioequivalence data illustrating that the generic drug formulation produces the same effects  within an acceptable range  as the previously approved innovator drug 
because published literature to support the safety and efficacy of post drugs may not be available  this procedure is of limited utility to generic drug manufacturers 
moreover  the utility of paper ndas has been further diminished by the recently broadened availability of the anda process  as described above 
among the requirements for new drug approval is the requirement that the prospective manufacturer s methods conform to the fda s current good manufacturing practice 
the cgmp regulations must be followed at all times during which the approved drug is manufactured 
in complying with the standards set forth in the cgmp regulations  the company must continue to expend time  money  and effort in the areas of production and quality control to ensure full technical compliance 
failure to comply with the cgmp regulations risks possible fda action  including but not limited to  the seizure of noncomplying drug products or  through the department of justice  enjoining the manufacture of such products 
the company is also subject to federal  state  and local laws of general applicability  such as laws regulating working conditions and the storage  transportation  or discharge of items that may be considered hazardous substances  hazardous waste  or environmental contaminants 
the company monitors its compliance with all environmental laws 
research and development the company incurred research and development r d expenses of approximately  in   in  and  in the r d spending includes spending on bioequivalence studies  internal development resources  as well as outsourced development

risk factors we operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks  some of which are beyond our control 
the following discussion highlights some of these risks and others are discussed elsewhere in this report 
these and other risks could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  operating results or cash flows 
risks associated with investing in the business of lannett if we are unable to successfully develop or commercialize new products  our operating results will suffer 
our future results of operations will depend to a significant extent upon our ability to successfully commercialize new generic products in a timely manner 
there are numerous difficulties in developing and commercializing new products  including developing  testing and manufacturing products in compliance with regulatory standards in a timely manner  receiving requisite regulatory approvals for such products in a timely manner  the availability  on commercially reasonable terms  of raw materials  including active pharmaceutical ingredients and other key ingredients  developing and commercializing a new product is time consuming  costly and subject to numerous factors that may delay or prevent the successful commercialization of new products  experiencing delays or unanticipated costs  and commercializing generic products may be substantially delayed by the listing with the fda of patents that have the effect of potentially delaying approval of the off patent product by up to months  and in some cases  such patents have issued and been listed with the fda after the key chemical patent on the branded drug product has expired or been litigated  causing additional delays in obtaining approval 
as a result of these and other difficulties  products currently in development by lannett may or may not receive the regulatory approvals necessary for marketing 
if any of our products  when developed and approved  cannot be successfully or timely commercialized  our operating results could be adversely affected 
we cannot guarantee that any investment we make in developing products will be recouped  even if we are successful in commercializing those products 

table of contents our gross profit may fluctuate from period to period depending upon our product sales mix  our product pricing  and our costs to manufacture or purchase products 
our future results of operations  financial condition and cash flows depend to a significant extent upon our product sales mix 
our sales of products that we manufacture tend to create higher gross margins than do the products we purchase and resell 
as a result  our sales mix will significantly impact our gross profit from period to period 
factors that may cause our sales mix to vary include the amount of new product introductions  marketing exclusivity  if any  which may be obtained on certain new products  the level of competition in the marketplace for certain products  the availability of raw materials and finished products from our suppliers  and the scope and outcome of governmental regulatory action that may involve us 
the profitability of our product sales is also dependent upon the prices we are able to charge for our products  the costs to purchase products from third parties  and our ability to manufacture our products in a cost effective manner 
if branded pharmaceutical companies are successful in limiting the use of generics through their legislative and regulatory efforts  our sales of generic products may suffer 
many branded pharmaceutical companies increasingly have used state and federal legislative and regulatory means to delay generic competition 
these efforts have included pursuing new patents for existing products which may be granted just before the expiration of one patent which could extend patent protection for additional years or otherwise delay the launch of generics  using the citizen petition process to request amendments to fda standards  seeking changes to us pharmacopoeia  an organization which publishes industry recognized compendia of drug standards  attaching patent extension amendments to non related federal legislation  and engaging in state by state initiatives to enact legislation that restricts the substitution of some generic drugs  which could have an impact on products that we are developing 
if branded pharmaceutical companies are successful in limiting the use of generic products through these or other means  our sales may decline 
if we experience a material decline in product sales  our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows will suffer 
third parties may claim that we infringe their proprietary rights and may prevent us from manufacturing and selling some of our products 
the manufacture  use and sale of new products that are the subject of conflicting patent rights have been the subject of substantial litigation in the pharmaceutical industry 
these lawsuits relate to the validity and infringement of patents or proprietary rights of third parties 
we may have to defend against charges that we violated patents or proprietary rights of third parties 
this is especially true in the case of generic products on which the patent covering the branded product is expiring  an area where infringement litigation is prevalent  and in the case of new branded products where a competitor has obtained patents 
table of contents for similar products 
litigation may be costly and time consuming  and could divert the attention of our management and technical personnel 
in addition  if we infringe on the rights of others  we could lose our right to develop or manufacture products or could be required to pay monetary damages or royalties to license proprietary rights from third parties 
although the parties to patent and intellectual property disputes in the pharmaceutical industry have often settled their disputes through licensing or similar arrangements  the costs associated with these arrangements may be substantial and could include ongoing royalties 
furthermore  we cannot be certain that the necessary licenses would be available to us on terms we believe to be acceptable 
as a result  an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding or failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us from manufacturing and selling a number of our products  which could harm our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient supplies from key suppliers that in some cases may be the only source of finished products or raw materials  our ability to deliver our products to the market may be impeded 
we are required to identify the supplier s of all the raw materials for our products in our applications with the fda 
to the extent practicable  we attempt to identify more than one supplier in each drug application 
however  some products and raw materials are available only from a single source and  in some of our drug applications  only one supplier of products and raw materials has been identified  even in instances where multiple sources exist 
to the extent any difficulties experienced by our suppliers cannot be resolved within a reasonable time  and at reasonable cost  or if raw materials for a particular product become unavailable from an approved supplier and we are required to qualify a new supplier with the fda  our profit margins and market share for the affected product could decrease  as well as delay our development and sales and marketing efforts 
our policies regarding returns  allowances and chargebacks  and marketing programs adopted by wholesalers  may reduce our revenues in future fiscal periods 
based on industry practice  generic drug manufacturers have liberal return policies and have been willing to give customers post sale inventory allowances 
under these arrangements  from time to time  we give our customers credits on our generic products that our customers hold in inventory after we have decreased the market prices of the same generic products due to competitive pricing 
therefore  if new competitors enter the marketplace and significantly lower the prices of any of their competing products  we would likely reduce the price of our product 
as a result  we would be obligated to provide credits to our customers who are then holding inventories of such products  which could reduce sales revenue and gross margin for the period the credit is provided 
like our competitors  we also give credits for chargebacks to wholesalers that have contracts with us for their sales to hospitals  group purchasing organizations  pharmacies or other customers 
a chargeback is the difference between the price the wholesaler pays and the price that the wholesaler s end customer pays for a product 
although we establish reserves based on our prior experience and our best estimates of the impact that these policies may have in subsequent periods  we cannot ensure that our reserves are adequate or that actual product returns  allowances and chargebacks will not exceed our estimates 
the design  development  manufacture and sale of our products involves the risk of product liability claims by consumers and other third parties  and insurance against such potential claims is expensive and may be difficult to obtain 
the design  development  manufacture and sale of our products involve an inherent risk of product liability claims and the associated adverse publicity 
insurance coverage is expensive and may be difficult to obtain  and may not be available in the future on acceptable terms  or at all 
although we currently maintain product liability insurance for our products in amounts we believe to be commercially 
table of contents reasonable  if the coverage limits of these insurance policies are not adequate  a claim brought against lannett  whether covered by insurance or not  could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
rising insurance costs could negatively impact profitability 
the cost of insurance  including workers compensation  product liability and general liability insurance  have risen in prior years and may increase in the future 
in response  we may increase deductibles and or decrease certain coverages to mitigate these costs 
these increases  and our increased risk due to increased deductibles and reduced coverages  could have a negative impact on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
the loss of our key personnel could cause our business to suffer 
the success of our present and future operations will depend  to a significant extent  upon the experience  abilities and continued services of key personnel 
if the employment of any of our current key personnel is terminated  we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and replace the employee with the same caliber of key personnel 
as such  we have entered into employment agreements with all of our senior executive officers 
significant balances of intangible assets  including product rights acquired  are subject to impairment testing and may result in impairment charges  which will adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
our acquired contractual rights to market and distribute products are stated at cost  less accumulated amortization and related impairment charges identified to date 
we determined the initial cost by referring to the original fair value of the assets exchanged 
future amortization periods for product rights are based on our assessment of various factors impacting estimated useful lives and cash flows of the acquired products 
such factors include the product s position in its life cycle  the existence or absence of like products in the market  various other competitive and regulatory issues and contractual terms 
significant changes to any of these factors would require us to perform an additional impairment test on the affected asset and  if evidence of impairment exists  we would be required to take an impairment charge with respect to the asset 
such a charge would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
risks relating to investing in the pharmaceutical industry extensive industry regulation has had  and will continue to have  a significant impact on our business  especially our product development  manufacturing and distribution capabilities 
all pharmaceutical companies  including lannett  are subject to extensive  complex  costly and evolving regulation by the federal government  principally the fda and to a lesser extent by the dea and state government agencies 
the federal food  drug and cosmetic act  the controlled substances act and other federal statutes and regulations govern or influence the testing  manufacturing  packing  labeling  storing  record keeping  safety  approval  advertising  promotion  sale and distribution of our products 
under these regulations  we are subject to periodic inspection of our facilities  procedures and operations and or the testing of our products by the fda  the dea and other authorities  which conduct periodic inspections to confirm that we are in compliance with all applicable regulations 
in addition  the fda conducts pre approval and post approval reviews and plant inspections to determine whether our systems 
table of contents and processes are in compliance with current good manufacturing practice  or cgmp  and other fda regulations 
following such inspections  the fda may issue notices on form that could cause us to modify certain activities identified during the inspection 
a form notice is generally issued at the conclusion of a fda inspection and lists conditions the fda inspectors believe may violate cgmp or other fda regulations 
fda guidelines specify that a warning letter is issued only for violations of regulatory significance for which the failure to adequately and promptly achieve correction may be expected to result in an enforcement action 
any such sanctions  if imposed  could materially harm our operating results and financial condition 
under certain circumstances  the fda also has the authority to revoke previously granted drug approvals 
similar sanctions as detailed above may be available to the fda under a consent decree  depending upon the actual terms of such decree 
although we have instituted internal compliance programs  if these programs do not meet regulatory agency standards or if compliance is deemed deficient in any significant way  it could materially harm our business 
certain of our vendors are subject to similar regulation and periodic inspections 
the process for obtaining governmental approval to manufacture and market pharmaceutical products is rigorous  time consuming and costly  and we cannot predict the extent to which we may be affected by legislative and regulatory developments 
we are dependent on receiving fda and other governmental or third party approvals prior to manufacturing  marketing and shipping our products 
consequently  there is always the chance that we will not obtain fda or other necessary approvals  or that the rate  timing and cost of such approvals  will adversely affect our product introduction plans or results of operations 
we carry inventories of certain product s in anticipation of launch  and if such product s are not subsequently launched  we may be required to write off the related inventory 
federal regulation of arrangements between manufacturers of branded and generic products could adversely affect our business 
as part of the medicare prescription drug  improvement  and modernization act of  companies are now required to file with the federal trade commission and the department of justice certain types of agreements entered into between brand and generic pharmaceutical companies related to the manufacture  marketing and sale of generic versions of branded drugs 
this new requirement could affect the manner in which generic drug manufacturers resolve intellectual property litigation and other disputes with branded pharmaceutical companies and could result generally in an increase in private party litigation against pharmaceutical companies or additional investigations or proceedings by the ftc or other governmental authorities 
the impact of this new requirement and the potential private party lawsuits associated with arrangements between brand name and generic drug manufacturers is uncertain  and could adversely affect our business 
the pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive 
we face strong competition in our generic product business 
revenues and gross profit derived from the sales of generic pharmaceutical products tend to follow a pattern based on certain regulatory and competitive factors 
as patents for brand name products and related exclusivity periods expire  the first generic manufacturer to receive regulatory approval for generic equivalents of such products is generally able to achieve significant market penetration 
as competing off patent manufacturers receive regulatory approvals on similar products or as brand manufacturers launch generic versions of such products for which no separate regulatory approval is required  market share  revenues and gross profit typically decline  in some cases dramatically 
accordingly  the level of market share  revenue and gross profit attributable to a particular generic product is normally related to the number of competitors in that product s market and the timing of that product s regulatory approval and launch  in relation to competing approvals and launches 
consequently  we must continue to develop and introduce new products in a timely and cost effective manner to maintain our revenues and gross margins 

table of contents sales of our products may continue to be adversely affected by the continuing consolidation of our distribution network and the concentration of our customer base 
our principal customers are wholesale drug distributors and major retail drug store chains 
these customers comprise a significant part of the distribution network for pharmaceutical products in the us this distribution network is continuing to undergo significant consolidation marked by mergers and acquisitions among wholesale distributors and the growth of large retail drug store chains 
as a result  a small number of large wholesale distributors control a significant share of the market  and the number of independent drug stores and small drug store chains has decreased 
we expect that consolidation of drug wholesalers and retailers will increase pricing and other competitive pressures on drug manufacturers  including lannett 
for the year ended june   our three largest customers accounted for  and respectively  of our net revenues 
the loss of any of these customers could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition and our cash flows 
in addition  the company has no long term supply agreements with its customers which would require them to purchase our products 
item b 
unresolved staff comments the company has received written comments from the securities and exchange commission staff during the current fiscal year 
the comments relate to form k dated june   and the forms q as of september   december  and march  lannett believes these comments will be resolved in the near future 
the company does not expect the resolution to have any material effect on the financial statements or disclosures 
item description of property lannett owns two facilities in philadelphia  pennsylvania  from where all operations are based 
the administrative offices  quality control laboratory  and manufacturing and production facilities are located in a  square foot facility at state road in philadelphia 
the second facility consists of  square feet  and is located within mile of the state road location  torresdale avenue in philadelphia 
our research laboratory  package  warehousing and distribution operations  sales and accounting departments are located in the second building 
in december  the company refinanced the mortgages on these two properties 
as of june   the mortgage balance was approximately million 
in june  lannett signed a lease agreement on a  square foot facility located on seven acres in philadelphia 
an additional agreement which gives us the option to buy the facility was also signed 
this new facility will hold the warehouse  and will become the future headquarters of the company 
we expect to 
table of contents begin occupying the building in december  with full conversion of the facility to take place over another to months 
the existing facilities will continue to operate  giving the company the ability to broaden its manufacturing and pharmaceutical development 

table of contents item legal proceedings the company monitors its compliance with all environmental laws 
any compliance costs which may be incurred are contingent upon the results of future site monitoring and will be charged to operations when incurred 
no monitoring costs were incurred during the years ended june   and the company is currently engaged in several civil actions as a co defendant with many other manufacturers of diethylstilbestrol des  a synthetic hormone 
prior litigation established that the company s pro rata share of any liability is less than one tenth of one percent 
due to the fact that prior litigation established the market share method of prorating liability amongst the companies that manufactured des during the drug s commercial distribution  which ended in  management has accepted this method as the most reasonably expected method of determining liability for future outcomes of claims 
the company was represented in many of these actions by the insurance company with which the company maintained coverage subject to limits of liability during the time period that damages were alleged to have occurred 
the insurance company denies coverage for actions alleging involvement of the company filed after january  with respect to these actions  the company paid nominal damages or stipulated to its pro rata share of any liability 
the company has either settled or is currently defending over such claims 
at this time  management is unable to estimate a range of loss  if any  related to these actions 
management believes that the outcome of these cases will not have a material adverse impact on the financial position or results of operations of the company 
in addition to the matters reported herein  the company is involved in litigation which arises in the normal course of business 
in the opinion of management  the resolution of these lawsuits will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position or results of the company

critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our critical accounting policies include those described below 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  refer to note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when its products are shipped 
at this point  title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer and provisions for estimates  including rebates  promotional adjustments  price adjustments  returns  chargebacks  and other potential adjustments are reasonably determinable 
accruals for these provisions are presented in the consolidated financial statements as rebates and chargebacks payable and reductions to net sales 
the change in the reserves for various sales adjustments may not be proportionally equal to the change in sales because of changes in both the product and the customer mix 
increased sales to wholesalers will generally require additional accruals as they are the primary recipient of chargebacks and rebates 
incentives offered to secure sales vary from product to product 
provisions for estimated rebates and promotional credits are estimated based upon contractual terms 
provisions for other customer credits  such as price adjustments  returns  and chargebacks  require management to make subjective judgments on customer mix 
unlike branded innovator drug companies  lannett does not use information about product levels in distribution channels from third party sources  such as ims and ndc health  in estimating future returns and other credits 
lannett calculates a chargeback rebate rate based on contractual terms with its customers and applies this rate to customer sales 
the only variable is customer mix  and this is based on historical data and sales expectations 
the chargeback rebate reserve is reviewed on a monthly basis by management using several ratio and calculated metrics 
lannett s methodology for estimating reserves has been consistent with previous periods 
chargebacks the provision for chargebacks is the most significant and complex estimate used in the recognition of revenue 
the company sells its products directly to wholesale distributors  generic 
table of contents distributors  retail pharmacy chains  and mail order pharmacies 
the company also sells its products indirectly to independent pharmacies  managed care organizations  hospitals  nursing homes  and group purchasing organizations  collectively referred to as indirect customers 
lannett enters into agreements with its indirect customers to establish pricing for certain products 
the indirect customers then independently select a wholesaler from which to actually purchase the products at these agreed upon prices 
lannett will provide credit to the wholesaler for the difference between the agreed upon price with the indirect customer and the wholesaler s invoice price if the price sold to the indirect customer is lower than the direct price to the wholesaler 
this credit is called a chargeback 
the provision for chargebacks is based on expected sell through levels by the company s wholesale customers to the indirect customers and estimated wholesaler inventory levels 
as sales to the large wholesale customers  such as cardinal health  amerisourcebergen  and mckesson  increase  the reserve for chargebacks will also generally increase 
however  the size of the increase depends on the product mix 
the company continually monitors the reserve for chargebacks and makes adjustments when management believes that actual chargebacks may differ from estimated reserves 
rebates rebates are offered to the company s key customers to promote customer loyalty and encourage greater product sales 
these rebate programs provide customers with rebate credits upon attainment of pre established volumes or attainment of net sales milestones for a specified period 
other promotional programs are incentive programs offered to the customers 
at the time of shipment  the company estimates reserves for rebates and other promotional credit programs based on the specific terms in each agreement 
the reserve for rebates increases as sales to certain wholesale and retail customers increase 
however  these rebate programs are tailored to the customers individual programs 
hence  the reserve will depend on the mix of customers that comprise such rebate programs 
returns consistent with industry practice  the company has a product returns policy that allows customers to return product within a specified period prior to and subsequent to the product s lot expiration date in exchange for a credit to be applied to future purchases 
the company s policy requires that the customer obtain pre approval from the company for any qualifying return 
the company estimates its provision for returns based on historical experience  changes to business practices  and credit terms 
while such experience has allowed for reasonable estimations in the past  history may not always be an accurate indicator of future returns 
the company continually monitors the provisions for returns and makes adjustments when management believes that actual product returns may differ from established reserves 
generally  the reserve for returns increases as net sales increase 
the reserve for returns is included in the rebates and chargebacks payable account on the balance sheet 
return periods will vary by customer and product 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company recorded a  write down in sales to account for expected returns 
this additional reserve came about because of returns from a major wholesaler that was unable to sell a significant amount of levothyroxine sodium tablets that it had purchased a year earlier 
the product was returned to the company in december  and concurrently written off as slow moving and short dated inventory 
other adjustments other adjustments consist primarily of price adjustments  also known as shelf stock adjustments  which are credits issued to reflect decreases in the selling prices of the company s products that customers have remaining in their inventories at the time of the price reduction 
decreases in selling prices are discretionary decisions made by management to reflect competitive market conditions 
amounts recorded for estimated shelf stock adjustments are based upon specified terms with direct customers  estimated declines in market prices  and estimates of inventory held by customers 
the company regularly monitors these and other factors and evaluates the reserve as additional information becomes available 
other adjustments are included in the rebates and chargebacks payable account on the balance sheet 
when competitors enter the market of existing products in  shelf stock adjustments are issued to maintain price competitiveness 
management foresaw this occurrence and appropriately reserved for it as seen in the table below 

table of contents the following tables identify the reserves for each major category of revenue allowance and a summary of the activity for the years ended june   and for the year ended june  reserve category chargebacks rebates returns other total reserve balance as of june  actual credits issued related to sales recorded in fiscal additional reserves charged to net sales during fiscal actual credits issued related to sales recorded in fiscal reserve balance as of june  for the year ended june  reserve category chargebacks rebates returns other total reserve balance as of june  actual credits issued related to sales recorded in fiscal additional reserves charged to net sales during fiscal actual credits issued related to sales recorded in fiscal reserve balance as of june  for the year ended june  reserve category chargebacks rebates returns other total reserve balance as of june  actual credits issued related to sales recorded in fiscal actual credits issued related to sales recorded in fiscal additional reserves charged to net sales during fiscal reserve balance as of june  reserve activity vs 
the chargeback reserve increased from  at june  to  at june  due to an increased level of sales in the months of may and june as compared to prior year 
historically  
table of contents the ratio of the reserve to gross sales is between and 
the fiscal years ended june  and were and  respectively 
in fiscal  there were additional reserves taken for an expected levothyroxine return 
this accounted for an additional million or 
there were no additional reserves charged to net sales in fiscal that relate to prior year sales 
rebates have decreased both in amount and as a percentage of the reserve in the additional credits issued related to sales recorded in fiscal due to the classification of rebates from wholesale customers 
when the reserve is calculated for the wholesale distribution customers  it is calculated in aggregate since they submit the amounts together 
this is in part the reason why the chargeback amount has increased 
however there is a large rebate reserve as of june  as direct customers those who receive the only rebates were a larger than usual portion of sales in the month of june  typically 
other increased due to an increase in shelf stock adjustments 
additional competitors in the primidone market have caused lannett to give more of this type of credit 
fluctuations in the amount of sales through the wholesaler channel will have an impact on the amount of reserve being charged 
due to the fact that wholesale sales result in greater chargebacks  an increase in wholesale sales will result in a higher level of chargebacks 
for the first  second  third and fourth quarters of fiscal  reserves recorded against sales amounted to million  million  million and million  respectively 
wholesaler sales were million  million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in the dollar value of the reserves corresponds to the increase in wholesale sales 
reserve activity vs 
actual credits processed against fiscal year chargebacks during fiscal year are nearly million less than the june  balance of  a result of overestimating the required reserve at june  the large majority of chargebacks occur from sales to wholesalers 
sales through these wholesalers were beginning to decline by the end of fiscal this decline resulted in lower chargebacks 
in addition  the competition within the generic industry  by competitors introducing similar pharmaceuticals  led to pressures on product sales and pricing 
often these competitors product introductions are not known in advance  and require the company to maintain flexible pricing strategies in order to not lose market share 
at this point  the sales decline through wholesalers was a result of greater competition 
due to the relatively small size of lannett s product offerings  the sales through the wholesalers may decline without much notice 
lannett s ability to compete will depend on the ability to add new products to offer wholesalers as well as pharmacy customers 
the company continued to estimate higher chargebacks than needed 
by the end of the fiscal year  sales through the wholesalers had increased again  the result of customers buying greater quantities before the fiscal year ended  and requiring a reserve of nearly million 
the rebates reserve of  at june  had  of credits issued against it during fiscal year this difference of  is an underestimate of rebates  which was corrected in the additional reserves taken in fiscal year by june   the rebates reserve is estimated to be  a result of declining overall sales during the last quarter of fiscal year the returns reserve balance at june    had actual credits of  issued against it during fiscal year this difference of  is not related to any one product 
by june  the returns reserve was increased to  as the company was anticipating a significant return from one customer on its levothyroxine sodium tablets 
the company ships its products to the warehouses of its wholesale  mail order  distributor and retail chain customers 
when the company and a customer come to an agreement for the supply of a product  the customer will generally continue to purchase the product  stock its warehouse s  and resell the 
table of contents product to its own customers 
the company s customer will continually reorder the product as its warehouse is depleted 
the company generally has no minimum size orders for its customers 
additionally  most warehousing customers prefer not to stock excess inventory levels due to the additional carrying costs and inefficiencies created by holding excess inventory 
as such  the company s customers continually reorder the company s products 
it is common for the company s customers to order the same products on a monthly basis 
for generic pharmaceutical manufacturers  it is critical to ensure that customers warehouses are adequately stocked with its products 
this is important due to the fact that several generic competitors compete for the consumer demand for a given product 
availability of inventory ensures that a manufacturer s product is considered 
otherwise  retail prescriptions would be filled with competitors products 
for this reason  the company periodically offers incentives to its customers to purchase its products 
these incentives are generally up front discounts off its standard prices at the beginning of a generic campaign launch for a newly approved or newly introduced product  or when a customer purchases a lannett product for the first time 
customers generally inform the company that such purchases represent an estimate of expected resale for a period of time 
this period of time is generally up to three months 
the company records this revenue  net of any discounts offered and accepted by its customers at the time of shipment 
the company s products have either months or months of shelf life at the time of manufacture 
the company monitors its customers purchasing trends to attempt to identify any significant lapses in purchasing activity 
if the company observes a lack of recent activity  inquiries will be made to such customer regarding the success of the customer s resale efforts 
the company attempts to minimize any potential return or shelf life issues by maintaining an active dialogue with the customers 
the products that the company sells are generic versions of brand named drugs 
the consumer markets for such drugs are well established markets with many years of historically confirmed consumer demand 
such consumer demand may be affected by several factors  including alternative treatments  cost  etc 
however  the effects of changes in such consumer demand for the company s products  like generic products manufactured by other generic companies  are gradual in nature 
any overall decrease in consumer demand for generic products generally occurs over an extended period of time 
this is because there are thousands of doctors   third party payers  institutional formularies and other buyers of drugs that must change prescribing habits  thereaputic modalities and medicinal practices before such a decrease would affect a generic drug market 
if the historical data the company uses and the assumptions management makes to calculate its estimates of future returns  chargebacks  and other credits do not accurately approximate future activity  its net sales  gross profit  net income and earnings per share could change 
however  management believes that these estimates are reasonable based upon historical experience and current conditions 
accounts receivable the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and adjusts credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by a review of current credit information 
the company continuously monitors collections and payments from its customers and maintains a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within both the company s expectations and the provisions established  the company cannot guarantee that it will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that it has in the past 
inventories the company values its inventory at the lower of cost determined by the first in  first out method or market  regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand  and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on estimated forecasts of product demand and production requirements 
the company s estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case it may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
in the future  if the company s inventory is determined to be overvalued  the company would be required to recognize such costs in cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
likewise  if inventory is determined to be undervalued  the company may have recognized excess cost of goods sold in previous periods and would be required to recognize such additional operating income at the time of sale

table of contents customer category fiscal net sales fiscal net sales fiscal net sales wholesaler distributor million million million retail chain million million million mail order pharmacy million million million private label million million million total million million million wholesaler distributor sales increased due to a rebound in levothyroxine sodium sales and sales of new products 
levothyroxine sodium sales increased as wholesalers reduced their inventories and began to reorder the product in larger volumes in fiscal mail order pharmacy sales increased due to new product sales and the fact that this area of the industry is growing at a faster rate than the other areas 
retail chain sales remained unchanged from the prior year  as new products sales replaced the loss of any existing products 
private label sales decreased due to our largest private label customer  qualitest  receiving fda approval in late november to manufacture its own primidone mg 
sales to the private label category may continue to decline  as lannett does not actively pursue additional private label customers because of the lower margins and product label inventories required to service the category 
cost of sales increased  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal this increase is due in part to higher production volumes to meet increased sales demand 
gross margins were in  an improvement over in improvement was  in part  affected by the prior year write off of short dated levothyroxine sodium 
 the prior year also experienced an increased return accrual  taken in anticipation of an unusually large return of levothyroxine 
the levothyroxine related write offs accounted for of cost of sales in the prior year 
aside from the prior year one time incidents related to levothyroxine  the margins increased due to additional product offerings and higher effective pricing 
despite new entrants to the primidone market  the company was able to maintain its market share and competitive price 
the company was also able to take advantage of its new products and the higher margin on these products 
depending on future market conditions for each of the company s products  changes in the future sales product mix may occur 
these changes may affect the gross profit percentage in future periods

significant changes in operating assets and liabilities are described below 
an increase in trade accounts receivable of  was partially due to increased sales in the most recent months of fiscal the may to june sales figures for were million greater than the same period in fiscal also  the prior year had customers with substantial credit balances at june  the company monitors its liquidity in a number of ways 
a days sales outstanding dso calculation is used to determine our ability to collect accounts receivable 
dso is analyzed in two ways  gross a r compared to average daily gross sales  and net a r net of reserve for chargebacks and rebates compared to average daily net sales 
for the first  second  third and fourth quarters of fiscal  this gross dso amounted to days  days  days and days  respectively 
the increase is due to delayed processing of credits from wholesale customers 
some delays were the result of customers failing to report all credits  while some were the responsibility of the company to act upon 
for the first  second  third and fourth quarters of fiscal  this net dso amounted to days  days  days and days  respectively 
net dso was low in the first quarter of fiscal due to two significant customers that had credit balances at september  these customers balances returned to normal balances due from the customers as additional sales were made 
inventory increased  due to the increase in quantity of products offered by the company 
the company offers more drugs than was offered in the previous year 
as a result  inventory increases were needed to be prepared for increasing product launches 
as our product offerings increase  higher inventory levels are expected  both in dollars and quantities 
this investment in inventory is vital to lannett s strategy of maintaining our reputation of always in stock 

table of contents a decrease in prepaid taxes of  is primarily attributable to taxable income in fiscal compared to a loss in fiscal an increase in accrued expenses of  was due to increased personnel expenses  professional expenses  and a receiving accrual for materials received at the end of the fiscal year 
these fluctuations are in the normal course of business 
the net cash used in investing activities of  for the twelve months ended june  was attributable to the company s loan to an api provider of  the company also had capital expenditures of  primarily related to several investments in production equipment and facility improvements 
this was offset by the sale of  of its marketable securities 
on december  the company refinanced  of its debt through the philadelphia industrial development corporation pidc and the pennsylvania industrial development authority pida

table of contents the company has executed security agreements with wachovia  pida and pidc in which the company has agreed to use substantially all of its assets to collateralize the amounts due 
the terms of the equipment loan require that the company meet certain financial covenants and reporting standards  including the attainment of standard financial liquidity and net worth ratios 
as of june   the company has complied with such terms  and successfully met its financial covenants 
the following table represents annual contractual obligations as of june  contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt operational leases purchase obligations other total prospects for the future the company has several generic products under development 
these products are all orally administered topical and parenteral products designed to be generic equivalents to brand named innovator drugs 
the company s developmental drug products are intended to treat a diverse range of indications 
as the oldest generic drug manufacturer in the country  formed in  lannett currently owns several andas for products which it does not manufacture and market 
these andas are simply dormant on the company s records 
occasionally  the company reviews such andas to determine if the market potential for any of these older drugs has recently changed  so as to make it attractive for lannett to reconsider manufacturing and selling it 
if the company makes the determination to introduce one of these products into the consumer marketplace  it must review the anda and related documentation to ensure that the approved product specifications  formulation and other factors meet current fda requirements for the marketing of that drug 
the company would then redevelop the product and submit it to the fda for supplemental approval 
the fda s approval process for anda supplements is similar to that of a new anda 
generally  in these situations  the company must file a supplement to the fda for the applicable anda  informing the fda of any significant changes in the manufacturing process  the formulation  or the raw material supplier of the previously approved anda 
a majority of the products in development represent either previously approved andas that the company is planning to reintroduce anda supplements  or new formulations new andas 
the products under development are at various stages in the development cycle formulation  scale up  and or clinical testing 
depending on the complexity of the active ingredient s chemical characteristics  the cost of the raw material  the fda mandated requirement of bioequivalence studies  the cost of such studies and other developmental factors  the cost to develop a new generic product varies 
it can range from  to million 
some of lannett s developmental products will require bioequivalence studies  while others will not depending on the fda s orange book classification 
since the company has no control over the fda review process  management is unable to anticipate whether or when it will be able to begin producing and shipping additional products 
in addition to the efforts of its internal product development group  lannett has contracted with several outside firms for the formulation and development of several new generic drug products 
these outsourced r d products are at various stages in the development cycle formulation  analytical method development and testing and manufacturing scale up 
these products are orally administered solid dosage products 
table of contents intended to treat a diverse range of medical indications 
it is the company s intention to ultimately transfer the formulation technology and manufacturing process for all of these r d products to the company s own commercial manufacturing sites 
the company initiated these outsourced r d efforts to complement the progress of its own internal r d efforts 
occasionally the company will work on developing a drug product that does not require fda approval 
the fda allows generic manufacturers to manufacture and sell products which are equivalent to innovator drugs which are grand fathered  under fda rules  prior to the passage of the hatch waxman act of the fda allows generic manufacturers to produce and sell generic versions of such grand fathered products by simply performing and internally documenting the product s stability over a period of time 
under this scenario  a generic company can forego the time required for fda anda approval 
the company signed supply and development agreements with olive healthcare  of india  orion pharma  of finland  azad pharma ag  of switzerland  and is in negotiations with companies in israel and greece for similar new product initiatives  in which lannett will market and distribute products manufactured by third parties 
lannett intends to use its strong customer relationships to build its market share for such products  and increase future revenues and income 
the majority of the company s r d projects are being developed in house under lannett s direct supervision and with company personnel 
hence  the company does not believe that its outside contracts for product development and manufacturing supply are material in nature  nor is the company substantially dependent on the services rendered by such outside firms 
since the company has no control over the fda review process  management is unable to anticipate whether or when it will be able to begin producing and shipping such additional products 
lannett may increase its focus on certain specialty markets in the generic pharmaceutical industry 
such a focus is intended to provide lannett customers with increased product alternatives in categories with relatively few market participants 
while there is no guarantee that lannett has the market expertise or financial resources necessary to succeed in such a market specialty  management is confident that such future focus will be well received by lannett customers and increase shareholder value in the long run 
the company plans to enhance relationships with strategic business partners  including providers of product development research  raw materials  active pharmaceutical ingredients as well as finished goods 
management believes that mutually beneficial strategic relationships in such areas  including potential financing arrangements  partnerships  joint ventures or acquisitions  could allow for potential competitive advantages in the generic pharmaceutical market 
for example  the company has entered into prepayment arrangements in exchange for discounted purchase prices on certain active pharmaceutical ingredients api and oral dosage forms 
the company has also arranged for a loan to a certain api provider as well as continued funding of recent operations of this api provider that should facilitate the availability of difficult to source material in the future 
the company plans to continue to explore such areas for potential opportunities to enhance shareholder value
