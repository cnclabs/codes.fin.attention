federal  state and local taxation federal taxation the following is a discussion of material tax matters and does not purport to be a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to the company 
general 
the bank was last audited by the internal revenue service irs for its taxable year ended december  for federal income tax purposes  the company files consolidated income tax returns on a june fiscal year basis using the accrual method of accounting and is subject to federal income taxation in the same manner as other corporations with some exceptions  including particularly the bank s tax reserve for bad debts  discussed below 
tax bad debt reserves 
the bank  as a large bank under irs classifications ie  one with assets having an adjusted basis of more than million  is i unable to make additions to its tax bad debt reserve  ii permitted to deduct bad debts only as they occur  and iii required to recapture ie  take into income over a multi year period  a portion of the balance of its tax bad debt reserves as of june  since the bank has already provided a deferred income tax liability for the bad debt reserve for financial reporting purposes  there was no adverse impact to the bank s financial condition or results of operations from the enactment of the federal legislation that imposed the recapture requirement 
distributions 
non dividend distributions to shareholders of the bank are considered distributions from the bank s base year reserve ie  its reserve as of december   to the extent thereof  and then from its supplemental reserve for losses on loans 
non dividend distributions include distributions i in excess of the bank s current and accumulated earnings and profits  as calculated for federal income tax purposes  ii for redemption of stock  and iii for partial or complete liquidation 
an amount based on the total non dividend distributions paid will be included in the bank s taxable income in the year of distribution 
dividends paid out of current or accumulated earnings and profits will not be so included in the bank s income 
the amount of additional taxable income created from a non dividend distribution is the amount that  when reduced by the amount of the tax attributable to this income  is equal to the amount of the distribution 
thus  assuming a federal corporate income tax rate  approximately one and one half times the amount of such distribution but not in excess of the amount of such reserves would be includable in income for federal income tax purposes 
see 
regulation regulation of federal savings associations limitation on capital distributions for a discussion of limits on the payment of dividends by the bank 
the bank does not intend to pay dividends that would result in a recapture of any portion of its base year tax bad debt reserves 
corporate alternative minimum tax 
the internal revenue code of  as amended the code imposes a tax on alternative minimum taxable income amti at a rate of 
amti is adjusted by determining the tax treatment of certain items in a manner that negates the deferral or deduction of income resulting from the customary tax treatment of those items 
thus  the bank s amti is increased by of the amount by which the bank s adjusted current earnings exceed its amti determined without regard to this adjustment and prior to reduction for net operating losses 
state and local taxation state of new york 
the company is subject to new york state nys franchise tax on one of several alternative bases  whichever results in the greatest tax  and files combined returns for this purpose 
the basic tax is measured by entire net income  which is federal taxable income with adjustments 
for nys tax purposes  as long as the bank continues to satisfy certain definitional tests relating to its assets and the nature of its business  it will be permitted deductions  within specified formula limits  for additions to its bad debt reserves for purposes of computing its entire net income 
the bank s deduction with respect to qualifying loans  which are generally loans secured by certain interests in real property  may be computed using an amount based on the bank s actual loss experience the experience method or of the bank s entire net income  computed without regard to this deduction and reduced by the amount of any permitted addition to the bank s reserve for non qualifying loans 
the bank s deduction with respect to non qualifying loans must be computed pursuant to the experience method 
the bank reviews the most appropriate method of calculating the deduction attributable to an addition to the tax bad debt reserves each year 
the portion of the nys bad debt reserve in excess of a reserve amount computed pursuant to the experience method is subject to recapture upon a non dividend distribution in a manner similar to the recapture of the federal bad debt reserves for such distributions 
the reserve is additionally subject to recapture in the event that the bank fails either to satisfy a thrift definitional test relating to the composition of its assets or to maintain a thrift charter 
in general  the holding company is not required to pay nys tax on dividends and interest received from the bank 
the nys tax rate for the year ended december  was of taxable income 
this rate included a commuter transportation surcharge 
city of new york 
the holding company and the bank are both subject to a nyc banking corporation tax of on taxable income allocated to nyc 
nyc generally conforms its tax law to nys tax law in the determination of taxable income including the laws relating to bad debt reserves 
nyc tax law  however  does not allow a deduction for the carryover of a net operating loss of a banking company 
state of delaware 
as a delaware holding company not earning income in delaware  the holding company is exempt from delaware corporate income tax  however  is required to file an annual report and pay an annual franchise tax to the state of delaware 
regulation general the bank is subject to extensive regulation  examination  and supervision by the ots  as its chartering agency  and the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic  as its deposit insurer 
the bank s deposit accounts are insured up to applicable limits by the bank insurance fund bif and the savings association insurance fund saif  which are administered by the fdic 
the bank must file reports with the ots concerning its activities and financial condition  and must obtain regulatory approval prior to entering into certain transactions  such as mergers with  or acquisitions of  other depository institutions 
the ots conducts periodic examinations to assess the bank s safety and soundness and compliance with various regulatory requirements 
this regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which a savings association may engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the deposit insurance fund and depositors 
as a publicly held unitary savings and loan holding company  the holding company is required to file certain reports with  and otherwise comply with the rules and regulations of  both the sec  under the federal securities laws  and the ots 
the ots and the fdic have significant discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies  including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes 
any change in such policies  whether by the ots  the fdic or the united states congress  could have a material adverse impact on the operations of the company 
the following discussion is intended to be a summary of the material statutes and regulations applicable to savings associations and savings and loan holding companies  and does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all such statutes and regulations 
regulation of federal savings associations business activities 
the bank derives its lending and investment powers from the home owners loan act  as amended hola  and the regulations of the ots enacted thereunder 
pursuant thereto  the bank may invest in mortgage loans secured by residential and commercial real estate  commercial and consumer loans  certain types of debt securities  and certain other assets 
the bank may also establish service corporations that may engage in activities not otherwise permissible for the bank  including certain real estate equity investments and securities and insurance brokerage activities 
the investment powers are subject to various limitations  including a i prohibition against the acquisition of any corporate debt security not rated in one of the four highest rating categories  ii limit of of capital on the aggregate amount of loans secured by non residential real property  iii limit of of assets on commercial loans  with the amount of commercial loans in excess of of assets being limited to small business loans  iv limit of of assets on the aggregate amount of consumer loans and acquisitions of certain debt securities  v limit of of assets on non conforming loans ie  loans in excess of specified amounts  and vi limit of the greater of of assets or capital on certain construction loans made for the purpose of financing property which is  or is expected to become  residential 
loans to one borrower 
under hola  savings associations are generally subject to identical limits on loans to one borrower as are imposed on national banks 
generally  pursuant to these limits  a savings association may not advance a loan or extend credit to a single or related group of borrowers in excess of of the association s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus 
additional amounts may be advanced  not in excess of of unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus  if such loans or extensions of credit are fully secured by readily marketable collateral 
such collateral is defined to include certain debt and equity securities and bullion  but generally does not include real estate 
at december   the bank s limit on loans to one borrower was million 
the bank s largest aggregate amount of loans to one borrower on that date was million and the second largest borrower had an aggregate loan balance of million 
qtl test 
hola requires savings associations to satisfy a qtl test 
a savings association may satisfy the qtl test by maintaining at least of its portfolio assets in certain qualified thrift investments during at least nine months of the most recent twelve month period 
portfolio assets means  in general  an association s total assets less the sum of i specified liquid assets up to of total assets  ii certain intangibles  including goodwill  credit card relationships and purchased msr  and iii the value of property used to conduct the association s business 
qualified thrift investments include various types of loans made for residential and housing purposes  investments related to such purposes  including certain mortgage backed and related securities  and small business  education  and credit card loans 
a savings association may additionally satisfy the qtl test by qualifying as a domestic building and loan association as defined in the code 
at december   the bank maintained of its portfolio assets in qualified thrift investments 
the bank also satisfied the qtl test in each of the prior months and  therefore  was a qtl 
a savings association that fails the qtl test must either operate under certain restrictions on its activities or convert to a bank charter 
the initial restrictions include prohibitions against i engaging in any new activity not permissible for a national bank  ii paying dividends not permissible under national bank regulations  and iii establishing any new branch office in a location not permissible for a national bank in the association s home state 
in addition  within one year of the date a savings association ceases to satisfy the qtl test  any company controlling the association must register under  and become subject to the requirements of  the bank holding company act of  as amended 
a savings association that has failed the qtl test may requalify under the qtl test and be relieved of the limitations  however  may do so only once 
if the savings association does not requalify under the qtl test within three years after failing the qtl test  it will be required to terminate any activity  and dispose of any investment  not permissible for a national bank  and repay as promptly as possible any outstanding advances from the fhlbny 
capital requirements 
ots regulations require savings associations to satisfy three minimum capital standards i a tangible capital ratio of  ii a risk based capital ratio of  and iii a leverage capital ratio 
for depository institutions that have been assigned the highest composite rating of under the uniform financial institutions rating system  the minimum required leverage capital ratio is 
for any other depository institution  the minimum required leverage capital ratio is  unless a higher leverage capital ratio is warranted by the particular circumstances or risk profile of the depository institution 
the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act fdicia requires that the ots and other federal banking agencies revise their risk based capital standards  with appropriate transition rules  to ensure that they take into account interest rate risk irr  concentration of risk and the risks of non traditional activities 
current ots regulations do not include a specific irr component of the risk based capital requirement  however  the ots monitors the irr of individual institutions through a variety of methods  including an analysis of the change in net portfolio value npv 
npv is the difference between the present value of the expected future cash flows of the bank s assets and liabilities  plus the value of net expected cash flows from either loan origination commitments or purchases of securities and  therefore  hypothetically represents the value of an institution s net worth 
the ots has also used the npv analysis as part of its evaluation of certain applications or notices submitted by thrift institutions 
in addition  ots thrift bulletin a provides guidance on the management of irr and the responsibility of boards of directors in that area 
the ots  through its general oversight of the safety and soundness of savings associations  retains the right to impose minimum capital requirements on individual institutions to the extent they are not in compliance with certain written ots guidelines regarding npv analysis 
the ots has not imposed any such requirements on the bank 
the table below presents the bank s regulatory capital as compared to the ots regulatory capital requirements at december  as of december  actual minimum capital requirement amount ratio amount ratio dollars in thousands tangible leverage capital total risk based capital the following is a reconciliation of gaap capital to regulatory capital for the bank at december  tangible capital leverage capital total risk based capital dollars in thousands gaap capital non allowable assets msr accumulated other comprehensive income goodwill general valuation allowance adjustment for recourse provision on loans sold regulatory capital minimum capital requirement regulatory capital excess limitation on capital distributions 
ots regulations impose limitations upon capital distributions by savings associations  such as cash dividends  payments to purchase or otherwise acquire its shares  payments to shareholders of another institution in a cash out merger  and other distributions charged against capital 
as the subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company  the bank is required to file a notice with the ots at least days prior to each capital distribution 
however  if the total amount of all capital distributions including each proposed capital distribution for the applicable calendar year exceeds net income for that year plus the retained net income for the preceding two years  then the bank must file an application for ots approval of a proposed capital distribution 
in addition  the ots can prohibit a proposed capital distribution otherwise permissible under the regulation if it determines that the association is in need of greater than customary supervision or that a proposed distribution would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice 
further  under ots prompt corrective action regulations  the bank would be prohibited from making a capital distribution if  after the distribution  the bank failed to satisfy its minimum capital requirements  as described above see 
regulation regulation of federal savings associations prompt corrective regulatory action 
in addition  pursuant to the federal deposit insurance act fdia  an insured depository institution such as the bank is prohibited from making capital distributions  including the payment of dividends  if  after making such distribution  the institution would become undercapitalized as defined in the fdia 
liquidity 
pursuant to ots regulations  the bank is required to maintain sufficient liquidity to ensure its safe and sound operation see 
part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources for further discussion 
at december   the bank s liquid assets approximated of total assets 
assessments 
savings associations are required by ots regulation to pay semi annual assessments to the ots to fund its operations 
the regulations base the assessment for individual savings associations  other than those with total assets never exceeding million  on three components the size of the association on which the basic assessment is based  the association s supervisory condition  which results in percentage increases for any savings institution with a composite rating of  or in its most recent safety and soundness examination  and the complexity of the association s operations  which results in percentage increases for a savings association that managed over billion in trust assets  serviced loans for other institutions aggregating more than billion  or had certain off balance sheet assets aggregating more than billion 
effective july   the ots adopted a final rule replacing examination fees for savings and loan holding companies with semi annual assessments 
the ots phased in the assessments at a rate of for the first semi annual assessment on july   of the second semi annual assessment on january  and of the third semi annual assessment on july  for the year ended december   the bank paid  in assessments 
branching 
subject to certain limitations  hola and ots regulations permit federally chartered savings associations to establish branches in any state of the united states 
the authority to establish such a branch is available i in states that expressly authorize branches of savings associations located in another state  and ii to an association that either satisfies the qtl test or qualifies as a domestic building and loan association under the code  which imposes qualification requirements similar to those for a qtl under hola see 
item business regulation regulation of federal savings associations qtl test 
hola and ots regulations preempt any state law purporting to regulate branching by federal savings associations 
community reinvestment 
under the community reinvestment act cra  as implemented by ots regulations  a savings association possesses a continuing and affirmative obligation  consistent with its safe and sound operation  to help satisfy the credit needs of its entire community  including low and moderate income neighborhoods 
the cra does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution s discretion to develop the types of products and services it believes are most appropriate to its particular community 
the cra requires the ots  in connection with its examination of a savings association  to assess the association s record of satisfying the credit needs of its community and consider such record in its evaluation of certain applications by the association 
the assessment is composed of three tests i a lending test  to evaluate the institution s record of making loans in its service areas  ii an investment test  to evaluate the institution s record of investing in community development projects  affordable housing  and programs benefiting low or moderate income individuals and businesses  and iii a service test  to evaluate the institution s delivery of services through its branches  automated teller machines and other offices 
the cra also requires all institutions to make public disclosure of their cra ratings 
the bank received an outstanding cra rating in its most recent examination 
regulations additionally require that the bank publicly disclose certain agreements that are in fulfillment of the cra 
the bank has no such agreements 
transactions with related parties 
the bank s authority to engage in transactions with its affiliates is limited by ots regulations and sections a  b  g and h of the federal reserve act fra  regulation w issued by the federal reserve board frb  as well as additional limitations adopted by the director of the ots 
ots regulations regarding transactions with affiliates conform to regulation w 
these provisions  among other matters  prohibit  limit or place restrictions upon a savings institution extending credit to  or entering into certain transactions with  its affiliates  which  for the bank  would include the holding company  principal shareholders  directors and executive officers 
ots regulations include additional restrictions on savings associations under section of hola  including provisions prohibiting a savings association from i advancing a loan to an affiliate engaged in non bank holding company activities  and ii purchasing or investing in securities issued by an affiliate that is not a subsidiary 
the ots regulations also include certain exemptions from these prohibitions 
the frb and the ots require each depository institution that is subject to sections a and b to implement policies and procedures to ensure compliance with regulation w and the ots regulations regarding transactions with affiliates 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of sarbanes oxley prohibits the extension of personal loans to directors and executive officers of issuers as defined in sarbanes oxley 
the prohibition  however  does not apply to any loan by an insured depository institution  such as the bank  if the loan is subject to the insider lending restrictions of section h of the fra  as implemented by regulation o cfr 
the bank s authority to extend credit to its directors  executive officers  and shareholders owning or more of the holding company s outstanding common stock  as well as to entities controlled by such persons  is additionally governed by the requirements of sections g and h of the fra and regulation o of the frb enacted thereunder 
among other matters  these provisions require that extensions of credit to insiders i be made on terms substantially the same as  and follow credit underwriting procedures not less stringent than  those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons and that do not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features  and ii not exceed certain amount limitations individually and in the aggregate  which limits are based  in part  on the amount of the association s capital 
regulation o additionally requires that extensions of credit in excess of certain limits be approved in advance by the association s board of directors 
the company and bank both presently prohibit loans to directors and executive management 
enforcement 
under fdicia  the ots possesses primary enforcement responsibility over federally chartered savings associations and has the authority to bring enforcement action against all institution affiliated parties  including any controlling stockholder or any shareholder  attorney  appraiser or accountant who knowingly or recklessly participates in any violation of applicable law or regulation  breach of fiduciary duty or certain other wrongful actions that cause  or are likely to cause  more than minimal loss or other significant adverse effect on an insured savings association 
civil penalties cover a wide series of violations and actions and range from  for each day during which violations of law  regulations  orders  and certain written agreements and conditions continue  up to million per day if the person obtained a substantial pecuniary gain as a result of such violation or knowingly or recklessly caused a substantial loss to the institution 
criminal penalties for certain financial institution crimes include fines of up to million and imprisonment for up to years 
in addition  regulators possess substantial discretion to take enforcement action against an institution that fails to comply with regulatory structure  particularly with respect to capital requirements 
possible enforcement actions range from the imposition of a capital plan and capital directive to receivership  conservatorship  or the termination of deposit insurance 
under fdicia  the fdic has the authority to recommend to the director of the ots that enforcement action be taken with respect to a particular savings association 
if action is not taken by the director  the fdic possesses authority to take such action under certain circumstances 
standards for safety and soundness 
pursuant to fdicia  as amended by the riegle community development and regulatory improvement act of  the ots  together with the other federal bank regulatory agencies  has adopted guidelines prescribing safety and soundness standards relating to internal controls and information systems  internal audit systems  loan documentation  credit underwriting  interest rate risk exposure  asset growth  asset quality  earnings and compensation  fees and benefits 
in general  the guidelines require  among other features  appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risks and exposures specified in the guidelines 
the guidelines prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer  employee  director or principal shareholder 
in addition  the ots has adopted regulations pursuant to fdicia that authorize  but do not require  the ots to order an institution that has been given notice by the ots that it is not satisfying any of such safety and soundness standards to submit a compliance plan 
if  after being so notified  an institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an accepted compliance plan  the ots must issue an order directing action to correct the deficiency and may issue an order directing other actions of the types to which an undercapitalized association is subject under the prompt corrective action provisions of fdicia see 
item business regulation regulation of savings associations prompt corrective regulatory action 
if an institution fails to comply with such an order  the ots may seek enforcement in judicial proceedings and the imposition of civil money penalties 
real estate lending standards 
the ots and the other federal banking agencies have adopted regulations prescribing standards for extensions of credit that are i secured by real estate  or ii made for the purpose of financing the construction of improvements on real estate 
the regulations require each savings association to establish and maintain written internal real estate lending standards that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices and appropriate to the size of the association and the nature and scope of its real estate lending activities 
the standards must additionally conform to accompanying ots guidelines  which include loan to value ratios for the different types of real estate loans 
associations are permitted to make a limited amount of loans that do not conform to the loan to value limitations provided such exceptions are reviewed and justified appropriately 
the guidelines additionally contain a number of lending situations in which exceptions to the loan to value standards are permitted 
prompt corrective regulatory action 
under the ots prompt corrective action regulations  the ots is required to take certain  and authorized to take other  supervisory actions against undercapitalized savings associations 
for this purpose  a savings association is placed in one of five categories based on the association s capital well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  and critically undercapitalized 
generally  a capital restoration plan must be filed with the ots within days of the date an association receives notice that it is undercapitalized 
in addition  the institution becomes subject to various mandatory supervisory actions  including restrictions on growth of assets and other forms of expansion 
generally  under the ots regulations  a federally chartered savings association is treated as well capitalized if its total risk based capital ratio is or greater  its tier risk based capital ratio is or greater  and its leverage ratio is or greater  and it is not subject to any order or directive by the ots to meet a specific capital level 
as of december   the bank satisfied all criteria necessary to be categorized well capitalized under the prompt corrective action regulatory framework 
when appropriate  the ots can require corrective action by a savings association holding company under the prompt corrective action provisions of fdicia 
insurance of deposit accounts 
savings associations are required to pay a deposit insurance premium 
the amount of the premium is determined based upon a risk based assessment system 
under the system  the fdic assigns an institution to one of three capital categories based upon the financial information contained in the institution s most current quarterly financial report filed with the applicable bank regulatory agency prior to the commencement of the assessment period 
the three capital categories consist of i well capitalized  ii adequately capitalized  or iii undercapitalized 
the fdic additionally assigns an institution to one of three supervisory subcategories within each capital group 
the supervisory subgroup to which an institution is assigned is based upon an evaluation provided to the fdic by the institution s primary federal regulator and information that the fdic determines to be relevant to the institution s financial condition and the risk posed to the deposit insurance funds 
an institution s assessment rate depends on the capital category and supervisory subcategory to which it is assigned 
under the regulations  there are nine assessment risk classifications ie  combinations of capital groups and supervisory subgroups to which different assessment rates are applied 
assessment rates currently range from of deposits for an institution in the highest category ie  well capitalized and financially sound  with no more than a few minor weaknesses to of deposits for an institution in the lowest category ie  undercapitalized and substantial supervisory concern 
the assessment rate for the bank s deposits is 
the fdic is authorized to raise the assessment rates as necessary to maintain the required reserve ratio of of assessable deposits 
both the bif and saif currently satisfy the reserve ratio requirement 
if the fdic determines that assessment rates should be increased  institutions in all risk categories could be affected 
the fdic has exercised this authority several times in the past and could raise insurance assessment rates in the future 
the deposit insurance funds act of amended the fdia to recapitalize the saif and expand the assessment base for the payments of financing corporation fico bonds 
fico bonds were sold by the federal government in order to finance the recapitalization of the saif and bif insurance funds that was necessitated following payments from the funds to compensate depositors of federally insured depository institutions that experienced bankruptcy and dissolution during the s and s 
the quarterly adjusted rate of assessment for fico bonds is for both bif and saif insured institutions 
the bank s total expense in for the fico bonds assessment was  privacy and security protection 
the ots has adopted regulations implementing the privacy protection provisions of the gramm leach bliley act of gramm leach 
the regulations require financial institutions to adopt procedures to protect customers and their non public personal information 
the regulations require the bank to disclose its privacy policy  including identifying with whom it shares non public personal information  to customers at the time of establishing the customer relationship and annually thereafter 
in addition  the bank is required to provide its customers the ability to opt out of the sharing of their personal information with unaffiliated third parties  if the sharing of such information does not satisfy any of the permitted exceptions 
the bank s existing privacy protection policy complies with the regulations 
the bank is additionally subject to regulatory guidelines establishing standards for safeguarding customer information to implement certain provisions of gramm leach 
the guidelines describe the federal banking agencies expectations for the creation  implementation and maintenance of an information security program  including administrative  technical and physical safeguards appropriate to the size and complexity of the institution and the nature and scope of its activities 
the standards set forth in the guidelines are intended to insure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information  protect against anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such records and unauthorized access to or use of such records or information that could result in substantial customer harm or inconvenience 
gramm leach additionally permits each state to enact legislation that is more protective of consumers personal information 
currently  there are a number of privacy bills pending in the new york legislature 
management of the company cannot predict the impact  if any  of these bills if enacted 
internet banking 
technological developments are dramatically altering the methods by which most companies  including financial institutions  conduct their business 
the growth of the internet is prompting banks to reconsider business strategies and adopt alternative distribution and marketing systems 
the federal banking regulatory agencies have conducted seminars and published materials targeted at various aspects of internet banking and have indicated their intention to re evaluate their regulations to ensure they encourage bank efficiency and competitiveness consistent with safe and sound banking practices 
the company cannot assure that federal bank regulatory agencies will not adopt new regulations that will not materially affect or restrict the bank s internet operations 
insurance activities 
as a federal savings association  the bank is generally permitted to engage in certain insurance activities through subsidiaries 
ots regulations prohibit depository institutions from conditioning the extension of credit to individuals upon either the purchase of an insurance product or annuity or an agreement by the consumer not to purchase an insurance product or annuity from an entity not affiliated with the depository institution 
the regulations additionally require prior disclosure of this prohibition if such products are offered to credit applicants 
fhlb system 
the bank is a member of the fhlbny  which is one of the twelve regional fhlb s composing the fhlb system 
each fhlb provides a central credit facility primarily for its member institutions 
any advances from the fhlbny must be secured by specified types of collateral  and long term advances may be obtained only for the purpose of providing funds for residential housing finance 
the bank  as a member of the fhlbny  is currently required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the fhlbny 
effective december   the fhlbny implemented a new capital plan which resulted in an automatic exchange of shares of fhlbny stock held by members for shares of fhlbny class b stock and changed the members minimum stock investment requirements 
the class b stock has a par value of per share and is redeemable upon five years notice  subject to certain conditions 
the class b stock has two subclasses  one for membership stock purchase requirements and the other for activity based stock purchase requirements 
the minimum stock investment requirement in the fhlbny class b stock is the sum of the membership stock purchase requirement  determined on an annual basis at the end of each calendar year and the activity based stock purchase requirement  determined on a daily basis 
for the bank  the membership stock purchase requirement is of mortgage related assets  as defined by the fhlbny  which consists primarily of residential mortgage loans and mbs held by the bank 
the activity based stock purchase requirement for the bank is equal to the sum of i of outstanding borrowings from the fhlbny  ii of the outstanding principal balance of the acquired member assets  as defined by the fhlbny  and delivery commitments for acquired member assets  iii a specified dollar amount related to certain off balance sheet items  which for the bank is zero  and iv a specific percentage range from to of the carrying value on the fhlbny s balance sheet of derivative contracts between the fhlbny and its members  which is also zero for the bank 
the fhlbny can adjust the specific percentages and dollar amount periodically within the ranges established by the fhlbny capital plan 
prior to december   the bank was required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock of the fhlbny in an amount equal to the greater of i  ii of the unpaid principal balance of residential mortgage loans and contracts and other mortgage related assets at the beginning of each year  or iii of the bank s aggregate outstanding advances from the fhlbny 
the bank is in compliance with these requirements with an investment in fhlbny stock of million at december federal reserve system 
the bank is subject to provisions of the fra and frb regulations pursuant to which savings associations are required to maintain non interest earning cash reserves against their transaction accounts primarily now and regular checking accounts 
frb regulations generally require that reserves be maintained in the amount of of the aggregate of transaction accounts between million and million subject to adjustment by the frb plus a reserve of subject to adjustment by the frb between and against the portion of total transaction accounts in excess of million 
the initial million of otherwise reservable balances are currently exempt from the reserve requirements  however  the exemption is adjusted by the frb at the end of each year 
the bank is in compliance with the foregoing reserve requirements 
because required reserves must be maintained in the form of either vault cash  a non interest bearing account at a federal reserve bank  or a pass through account as defined by the frb  the effect of this reserve requirement is to reduce the bank s interest earning assets 
the balances maintained to satisfy the frb reserve requirements may be used to satisfy liquidity requirements imposed by the ots 
frb members are additionally authorized to borrow from the federal reserve discount window  however  frb regulations require such institutions to hold reserves in the form of vault cash or deposits with federal reserve banks in order to borrow

item a 
risk factors the bank s focus on multifamily and commercial real estate lending may subject it to greater risk of an adverse impact on operations from a decline in the economy 
the majority of loans in the bank s portfolio are secured by multifamily residential property 
multifamily loans are generally viewed as exposing lenders to a greater risk of loss than one to four family residential loans and typically involve higher loan principal amounts 
although multifamily loans are generally non recourse  are underwritten based upon the cash flow generated by the collateral property and have loan to value ratios of less than  in a decline in the economy  a borrower experiencing financial difficulties in connection with one income producing property may default on all of its outstanding loans  even if the properties securing the other loans are generating positive cash flow 
in addition  large loans tend to expose the bank to a greater degree of risk due to the potential impact of losses from any one loan or concentration of loans to one borrower relative to the size of the bank s capital position 
as part of the company s strategic plan  it has increased its emphasis on commercial real estate loans over the past five years 
loans secured by commercial real estate are generally larger and involve a greater degree of risk than one to four family and multifamily residential mortgage loans 
because payments on loans secured by commercial real estate are often dependent upon successful operation or management of the collateral properties  repayment of such loans are generally subject to a greater extent to the then prevailing conditions in the real estate market or the economy 
further  the collateral securing such loans may depreciate over time  may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value based upon the success of the business 
multifamily and commercial real estate loans additionally involve a greater risk than one to four family residential mortgage loans because economic and real estate conditions and government regulations  such as rent control and rent stabilization laws  which are outside the control of the borrower or the bank  could impair the value of the security for the loan or the future cash flow of such properties 
as a result  rental income might not rise sufficiently over time to satisfy increases in the loan rate at repricing or increases in overhead expenses ie  utilities  taxes  ie impaired loans are thus difficult to identify before they become problematic 
in addition  if the cash flow from a collateral property is reduced eg  if leases are not obtained or renewed  the borrower s ability to repay the loan and the value of the security for the loan may be impaired 
dependence on economic and real estate conditions and geographic concentration in market area 
the bank gathers deposits primarily from the communities and neighborhoods in close proximity to its branches 
the bank s primary lending area is the new york city metropolitan area  although its overall lending area is much larger  and extends approximately miles in each direction from its corporate headquarters in brooklyn 
the majority of the bank s mortgage loans are secured by properties located in its primary lending area  most of which are secured by real estate located in the new york city boroughs of brooklyn  queens and manhattan 
as a result of this geographic concentration  the bank s results of operations depend largely upon economic conditions in this area 
a deterioration in economic conditions in the new york metropolitan area could have a material adverse impact upon the quality of the bank s loan portfolio and the demand for its products and services  and  accordingly  on the company s results of operations  cash flows  business  financial condition and prospects 
conditions in the real estate markets in which the collateral for the bank s mortgage loans are located strongly influence the level of the bank s non performing loans and the value of its collateral 
real estate values are affected by  among other items  flucuations in general or local economic conditions  supply and demand  changes in governmental rules or policies  the availability of loans to potential purchasers and acts of nature 
declines in real estate markets have in the past and may in the future negatively impact the company s results of operations  cash flows  business  financial condition and prospects 
the bank s allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level considered adequate by management to absorb losses inherent in its loan portfolio 
the amount of inherent loan losses which could be ultimately realized is susceptible to changes in economic  operating and other conditions  including changes in interest rates  that could be beyond the bank s control 
such losses could exceed current estimates 
although management believes that the bank s allowance for loan losses is adequate  there can be no assurance that the allowance will be sufficient to satisfy actual loan losses should such losses be realized 
increases in interest rates may reduce the company s profitability 
the bank s primary source of income is its net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income earned on its interest earning assets and the interest expense incurred on its interest bearing liabilities 
the one year interest rate sensitivity gap is the difference between interest rate sensitive assets maturing or repricing within one year and interest rate sensitive liabilities maturing or repricing within one year  expressed as a percentage of total assets 
in a rising interest rate environment  an institution with a negative gap would generally be expected  absent the effects of other factors  to experience a greater increase in its cost of liabilities relative to its yield on assets  and thus decrease its net interest income 
in addition  the actual amount of time before mortgage loans and mbs are repaid can be significantly impacted by changes in mortgage redemption rates and market interest rates 
mortgage prepayment  satisfaction and refinancing rates will vary due to several factors  including the regional economy in the area where the underlying mortgages were originated  seasonal factors  and other demographic variables 
however  the most significant factors affecting prepayment  satisfaction and refinancing rates are prevailing interest rates  related mortgage refinancing opportunities and competition 
based upon historical experience  if interest rates were to rise  the bank would expect the demand for multifamily loans to decline 
decreased loan origination volume would likely negatively impact the bank s interest income 
in addition  if interest rates were to rise rapidly and result in an economic decline  the bank would expect its level of non performing loans to increase 
such an increase in non performing loans may result in an increase to the allowance for loan losses and possible increased charge offs  which would negatively impact the company s net income 
as a federally chartered savings bank  the bank is required to monitor changes in its 
npv 
in addition  the bank monitors its npv ratio  which is the npv divided by the estimated market value of total assets 
the npv ratio can be viewed as a corollary to the bank s capital ratios 
to monitor its overall sensitivity to changes in interest rates  the bank simulates the effect of instantaneous changes in interest rates of up to basis points on its assets and liabilities 
interest rates do and will continue to fluctuate  and the bank cannot predict future federal reserve actions or other factors that will cause interest rates to change 
risks related to changes in laws  government regulation and monetary policy 
the holding company and the bank are subject to extensive supervision  regulation and examination by the ots  as the bank s chartering agency  and the fdic  as its deposit insurer 
such regulation limits the manner in which the holding company and the bank conduct business  undertake new investments and activities and obtain financing 
this regulation is designed primarily for the protection of the deposit insurance funds and the bank s depositors  and not to benefit the bank or its creditors 
the regulatory structure also provides the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies  including policies with respect to capital levels  the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes

financial institution regulation has been the subject of significant legislation in recent years  and may be the subject of further significant legislation in the future  none of which is within the control of the holding company or the bank 
significant new laws or changes in  or repeals of  existing laws may cause the company s results of operations to differ materially 
further  federal monetary policy  particularly as implemented through the ots  significantly affects credit conditions for the company  primarily through open market operations in united states government securities  the discount rate for bank borrowings and reserve requirements 
a material change in any of these conditions would have a material impact on the bank  and therefore  on the company s results of operations 
competition from other financial institutions in originating loans and attracting deposits may adversely affect profitability 
the bank s retail banking and a significant portion of its lending business are concentrated in the new york metropolitan area 
the new york city banking environment is extremely competitive 
the bank s competition for loans exists principally from savings banks  commercial banks  mortgage banks and insurance companies 
the bank has faced sustained competition for the origination of multifamily residential and commercial real estate loans 
management anticipates that the current level of competition for multifamily residential and commercial real estate loans will continue for the foreseeable future  and this competition may inhibit the bank s ability to maintain its current level and pricing of such loans 
the bank gathers deposits in direct competition with commercial banks  savings banks and brokerage firms  many among the largest in the nation 
in addition  it must also compete for deposit monies against the stock markets and mutual funds  especially during periods of strong performance in the equity markets 
over the previous decade  consolidation in the financial services industry  coupled with the emergence of internet banking  has altered the deposit gathering landscape and may increase competitive pressures on the bank

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary the holding company s primary business is the operation of the bank 
the company s consolidated results of operations are dependent primarily on net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income earned on interest earning assets  such as loans and securities  and the interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings 
the bank additionally generates non interest income such as service charges and other fees  as well as income associated with bank owned life insurance 
non interest expense primarily consists of employee compensation and benefits  federal deposit insurance premiums  data processing costs  occupancy and equipment expenses  marketing expenses and other operating expenses 
the company s consolidated results of operations are also significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions particularly fluctuations in market interest rates  government policies  changes in accounting standards and actions of regulatory agencies 
the bank s primary strategy is generally to increase its household and deposit market shares in the communities which it serves 
during the last five operating quarters  however  growth has been restricted as a result of the interest rate environment  which management has deemed unfavorable for significant balance sheet growth 
the bank also generally seeks to increase its product and service utilization for each individual depositor 
in addition  the bank s primary strategy includes the origination of  and investment in  mortgage loans  with an emphasis on multifamily residential and commercial real estate loans 
recently  the bank has continued to increase its portfolios of loans secured by commercial real estate  as well as mixed use properties typically comprised of ground level commercial units and residential apartments on the upper floors 
the company believes that multifamily residential and commercial real estate loans provide advantages as investment assets 
initially  they offer a higher yield than investment securities of comparable maturities or terms to repricing 
in addition  origination and processing costs for the bank s multifamily residential and commercial real estate loans are lower per thousand dollars of originations than comparable one to four family loan costs 
further  the bank s market area has generally provided a stable flow of new and refinanced multifamily residential and commercial real estate loan originations 
in order to address the credit risk associated with multifamily residential and commercial real estate lending  the bank has developed underwriting standards that it believes are reliable in order to maintain consistent credit quality for its loans 
the bank also strives to provide a stable source of liquidity and earnings through the purchase of investment grade securities  seeks to maintain the asset quality of its loans and other investments  and uses appropriate portfolio and asset liability management techniques in an effort to manage the effects of interest rate volatility on its profitability and capital 
the net interest spread and net interest margin declined during the year ended december  these declines were attributable to the continued low interest rate environment on loans coupled with increases in short term interest rates during the year ended december  these conditions resulted in a greater increase in the average cost of interest bearing liabilities than the yield on interest earning assets during the year 
in addition  reductions in multifamily residential and commercial real estate loan prepayment fees as a result of increased interest rates  which declined million during the year ended december   reduced the overall level of non interest income during critical accounting policies various elements of the company s accounting policies  by their nature  are inherently subject to estimation techniques  valuation assumptions and other subjective assessments 
the company s policies with respect to the methodologies it uses to determine the allowance for loan losses  the valuation of msr  accumulated pension obligations  asset impairments including the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets  realization of deferred tax assets and other than temporary declines in the valuation of securities  and loan income recognition are the company s most critical accounting policies because they are important to the presentation of the company s financial condition and results of operations  involve a high degree of complexity and require management to make difficult and subjective judgments which often necessitate assumptions or estimates about highly uncertain matters 
the use of different judgments  assumptions and estimates could result in material variations in the company s results of operations or financial condition 
the following are descriptions of the company s critical accounting policies and explanations of the methods and assumptions underlying their application 
these policies and their application are reviewed periodically and at least annually with the audit committees of the holding company and the bank 
allowance for loan losses 
gaap requires the bank to maintain an appropriate allowance for loan losses 
the bank s loan loss reserve methodology consists of several key components  including a review of the two elements of the bank s loan portfolio classified loans ie  non performing loans  troubled debt restructuring and impaired loans under amended sfas and performing loans 
management uses available information to estimate losses on loans and believes that the bank maintains its allowance for loan losses at appropriate levels 
adjustments may be necessary  however  if future economic  market or other conditions differ from the current operating environment 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the bank s allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require the bank to recognize additions to  or reductions in  the allowance based on judgments different from those of management 
although the bank believes it utilizes the most reliable information available  the level of the allowance for loan losses remains an estimate subject to significant judgment 
these evaluations are inherently subjective because  although based upon objective data  it is management s interpretation of that data that determines the amount of the appropriate allowance 
the company  therefore  periodically reviews the actual performance and charge off of its portfolio and compares them to the previously determined allowance coverage percentages 
in so doing  the company evaluates the impact that the variables discussed below may have on the portfolio to determine whether or not changes should be made to the assumptions and analyses 
performing loans at december   the majority of the allowance for loan losses was allocated to performing loans  which represented the overwhelming majority of the bank s loan portfolio 
performing loans are reviewed at least quarterly based upon the premise that there are losses inherent within the loan portfolio that have not been identified as of the review date 
the bank thus calculates an allowance for loan losses related to its performing loans by deriving an expected loan loss percentage and applying it to its performing loans 
in deriving the expected loan loss percentage  the bank generally considers the following criteria the bank s historical loss experience  the age and payment history of the loans commonly referred to as their seasoned quality  the type of loan ie  one to four family  multifamily residential  commercial real estate  cooperative apartment  construction or consumer  the underwriting history of the loan ie  whether it was underwritten by the bank or a predecessor institution acquired by the bank and  therefore  originally subjected to different underwriting criteria  both the current condition and recent history of the overall local real estate market in order to determine the accuracy of utilizing recent historical charge off data to derive the expected loan loss percentages  the level of  and trend in  non performing loans  the level and composition of new loan activity  and the existence of geographic loan concentrations as the overwhelming majority of the bank s loans are secured by real estate properties located in the nyc metropolitan area or specific industry conditions within the portfolio segments 
since these criteria affect the expected loan loss percentages that are applied to performing loans  changes in any of them will effect the amount of the allowance and the provision for loan losses 
the bank applied the process of determining the allowance for loan losses consistently throughout both the years ended december  and classified loans federal regulations and bank policy require that loans possessing certain weaknesses be classified as substandard  doubtful or loss assets see 
item business asset quality classified assets 
assets that do not expose the bank to risk sufficient to justify classification in one of these categories  however  which possess potential weaknesses that deserve management s attention  are designated special mention 
loans classified as special mention  substandard or doubtful are reviewed individually on a quarterly basis by the bank s loan loss reserve committee to determine the level of possible loss  if any  that should be provided for within the bank s allowance for loan losses 
the bank s policy is to charge off immediately all balances classified as loss and record a reduction of the allowance for loan losses for the full amount of the outstanding loan balance 
the bank applied this process consistently throughout the years ended december  and under the guidance established by amended sfas  loans determined to be impaired generally  non performing and troubled debt restructured multifamily residential and commercial real estate loans and non performing one to four family loans in excess of  are evaluated at least quarterly in order to establish whether the estimated value of the underlying collateral determined based upon an independent appraisal is sufficient to satisfy the existing debt 
for each loan that the bank determines to be impaired  impairment is measured by the amount that the carrying balance of the loan  including all accrued interest  exceeds the estimated fair value of the collateral 
a specific reserve is established on all impaired loans to the extent of impairment and comprises a portion of the allowance for loan losses 
the loan loss reserve committee s determination of the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral is subject to assumptions and judgments made by the committee 
a specific valuation allowance could differ materially as a result of changes in these assumptions and judgments 
valuation of msr 
the estimated origination and servicing costs of mortgage loans sold with servicing rights retained by the bank are allocated between the loans and the servicing rights based on their estimated fair values at the time of the loan sale 
msr are carried at the lower of cost or fair value and are amortized in proportion to  and over the period of  net servicing income 
the estimated fair value of msr is determined by calculating the present value of estimated future net servicing cash flows  using prepayment  default  servicing cost and discount rate assumptions that the company believes market participants would use for similar assets 
all estimates and assumptions utilized in the valuation of msr are derived based upon actual historical results for either the bank or its industry peers 
the fair value of msr is sensitive to changes in assumptions 
fluctuations in prepayment speed assumptions have the most significant impact on the fair value of msr 
in the event that loan prepayment activities increase due to increased loan refinancing  the fair value of msr would likely decline 
in the event that loan prepayment activities decrease due to a decline in loan refinancing  the fair value of msr would likely increase 
any measurement of msr is limited by the existing conditions and assumptions utilized at a particular point in time  and would not necessarily be appropriate if applied at a different point in time 
capitalized msr are stratified based on predominant risk characteristics of the underlying loans for the purpose of evaluating impairment 
a valuation allowance is then established in the event the recorded value of an individual stratum exceeds its fair value 
asset impairment adjustments 
certain assets are carried in the company s consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or at the lower of cost or fair value 
management periodically performs analyses to test for impairment of these assets 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to recognize such impairment 
two significant impairment analyses relate to the value of goodwill and other than temporary declines in the value of the company s securities 
goodwill is accounted for in accordance with sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  which was adopted on july  sfas eliminated amortization of goodwill and instead requires performance of an annual impairment test at the reporting unit level 
as of both july  and december   the company had goodwill totaling million 
the company identified a single reporting unit for purposes of its goodwill impairment testing 
the impairment test is therefore performed on a consolidated basis and compares the company s market capitalization reporting unit fair value to its outstanding equity reporting unit carrying value 
the company utilizes its closing stock price as reported on the nasdaq national market on the date of the impairment test in order to compute market capitalization 
the company has designated the last day of its fiscal year as the annual date for impairment testing 
the company performed its annual impairment test as of december  and concluded that no potential impairment of goodwill existed since the fair value of the company s reporting unit exceeded its carrying value 
no events have occurred  nor circumstances changed  subsequent to december  that would reduce the fair value of the company s reporting unit below its carrying value 
such events or changes in circumstances would require an immediate impairment test to be performed in accordance with sfas differences in the identification of reporting units or the use of valuation techniques can result in materially different evaluations of impairment 
available for sale debt and equity securities that have readily determinable fair values are carried at fair value 
estimated fair values for securities are based on published or securities dealers market values 
debt securities are classified as held to maturity  and carried at amortized cost  only if the company has a positive intent and ability to hold them to maturity 
equity securities cannot be classified as held to maturity 
debt securities that are not classified as held to maturity  along with all equity securities  are classified as either securities available for sale or trading securities 
at both december  and  the company had no trading securities 
unrealized holding gains or losses on debt and equity securities available for sale are excluded from net income and reported net of income taxes as other comprehensive income or loss 
the company conducts periodic reviews and evaluations of its securities portfolio taking into account the severity and duration of an unrealized loss  as well as management s intent with regard to the securities  in order to determine if a decline in market value of any security below its carrying value is other than temporary 
if such decline is deemed other than temporary  the carrying amount of the security is adjusted through a valuation allowance  with an applicable charge recorded in the company s statement of operations 
for the periods ended december  and  there were no other than temporary impairments in the securities portfolio 
loan income recognition 
interest income on loans is recorded using the level yield method 
loan origination fees and certain direct loan origination costs are deferred and amortized as a yield adjustment over the contractual loan terms 
accrual of interest is discontinued when its receipt is in doubt  which typically occurs when a loan becomes days past due as to principal or interest 
any interest accrued to income in the year when interest accruals are discontinued is reversed 
payments on nonaccrual loans are generally applied to principal 
management may elect to continue the accrual of interest when a loan is in the process of collection and the estimated fair value of the collateral is sufficient to satisfy the principal balance and accrued interest 
loans are returned to accrual status once the doubt concerning collectibility has been removed and the borrower has demonstrated performance in accordance with the loan terms and conditions for a minimum of twelve months 
liquidity and capital resources the bank s primary sources of funding for its lending and investment activities include deposits  loan and mbs payments  investment security maturities and redemptions  fhlbny advances and borrowings in the form of repos entered into with various financial institutions  including the fhlbny 
the bank also sells selected multifamily residential and commercial real estate loans to fnma  and long term  one to four family residential real estate loans to either fnma or sonyma 
the company may additionally issue debt under appropriate circumstances 
although maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and investments are predictable sources of funds  deposits flows and prepayments on mortgage loans and mbs are influenced by interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
the bank gathers deposits in direct competition with commercial banks  savings banks  internet banks and brokerage firms  many among the largest in the nation 
it must additionally compete for deposit monies against the stock and bond markets  especially during periods in which these markets achieve strong performance 
the bank s deposit flows are affected primarily by the pricing and marketing of its deposit products compared to its competitors  as well as the market performance of depositor investment alternatives such as the us bond or equity markets 
to the extent that the bank is responsive to general market increases or declines in interest rates  its deposit flows should not be materially impacted 
however  favorable performance of the equity or bond markets could adversely impact the bank s deposit flows 
deposits decreased million during the year ended december   compared to an increase of million during the year ended december  during both the second half of and the year ended december   while short term interest rates were steadily increasing  the bank  primarily in order to control its overall cost of deposits  elected to maintain the non promotional interest rates offered on its various deposit accounts at or near their existing levels 
as a result  deposit attrition increased during this time period especially in the case of promotional money market deposits that reached the end of their promotional offering rates and exceeded the level of new deposits gathered through ongoing promotional programs 
money market deposits thus declined million during the year ended december  partially offsetting the decline in money market accounts was an increase in cds of million  as a portion of money market balances migrated to cds as interest rates became more attractive 
the increase in deposits during the year ended december  reflected increased marketing efforts that helped generate additional balances in cds and core ie  non cd deposit accounts 
successful cd promotional campaigns implemented during the year ended december  resulted in cd growth of million during the period 
in order to both replace liquidity lost by the attrition of deposits and reduce the overall level of interest rate risk associated with its assets  the company sold million of investment securities and million of mbs available for sale during the quarter ended june  the securities sold had an average yield of and an average estimated duration of years upon their disposition 
during the year ended december   principal repayments totaled million on real estate loans and million on mbs 
during the year ended december   principal repayments totaled million on real estate loans and million on mbs 
the decrease in principal repayments on loans and mbs resulted from a reduction in borrower refinance activities associated with mortgage related assets as a result of increases in interest rates during the decrease in principal repayments on mbs additionally reflected the reduction in their balance due to the sale of securities during the year ended december  since december  the bank has originated and sold multifamily residential mortgage loans in the secondary market to fnma while retaining servicing and generating fee income while it services the loan 
the bank underwrites these loans using its customary underwriting standards  funds the loans  and sells them to fnma at agreed upon pricing 
typically  the bank seeks to sell loans with terms to maturity or repricing in excess of seven years from the origination date since it does not desire to retain such loans in portfolio as a result of the heightened interest rate risk they possess 
under the terms of the sales program  the bank is required to retain a portion of the associated credit risk 
once established  such amount continues to increase as long as the bank continues to sell loans to fnma under the program 
the bank retains this exposure until the portfolio of loans sold to fnma is satisfied in its entirety or the bank funds claims by fnma for the maximum loss exposure 
during the years ended december  and  the bank sold fnma million and million of loans  respectively  pursuant to this program 
during the years ended december  and  the company  based upon market conditions prevailing at the time  elected to sell previously originated loans to fnma to reduce future interest rate risk on its balance sheet 
in furtherance of the bank s strategy to limit asset growth during the year ended december   no new repo borrowings were undertaken during the period 
during the year ended december   repos increased million 
during the year ended december   the company added repo borrowings with an average maturity of years and a weighted average interest cost of in order to fund securities purchases 
fhlbny advances increased million during the year ended december   and declined million during the year ended december  during the year ended december   management utilized repos and deposits as the primary sources for funding asset growth 
in december  management undertook an additional million fhlbny advance for general business purposes as deposit attrition exceeded expected levels during the fourth quarter of on march   the company received net proceeds of million from the issuance of debt in the form of trust preferred securities 
these borrowings bear interest at a rate of for years and are callable at any time after years 
the company has utilized a portion of the proceeds to repurchase its common stock  and has invested the remaining balance in short term securities 
the levels of the bank s short term liquid assets are dependent on its operating  financing and investing activities during any given period 
the bank monitors its liquidity position daily 
in the event that the bank should require funds beyond its ability to generate them internally  an additional source of funds is available through use of its borrowing line at the fhlbny 
at december   the bank had an additional potential borrowing capacity of million available should it purchase the minimum required level of fhlbny common stock ie  of its outstanding fhlbny borrowings 
the bank is subject to minimum regulatory capital requirements imposed by the ots  which  as a general matter  are based on the amount and composition of an institution s assets 
at december   the bank was in compliance with all applicable regulatory capital requirements and was considered well capitalized for all regulatory purposes 
the bank uses its liquidity and capital resources primarily for the origination of real estate loans and the purchase of mortgage backed and other securities 
during the year ended december  and  real estate loan originations totaled millon and billion  respectively 
purchases of investment securities excluding short term investments and federal funds sold and mbs  which were million during the year ended december   totaled million for the year ended december  the decrease in both loan origination levels and investment purchases during the year ended december  reflected management s decision to temporarily forego asset growth including interest earning assets while medium and long term interest rates remained at historically low levels 
additionally contributing to the decrease in loan originations were increases in interest rates during both the second half of and the year ended december  which resulted in a decline in loan refinance activity during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  during the year ended december   the holding company repurchased  shares of its common stock into treasury 
all shares repurchased were recorded at the acquisition cost  which totaled million during the period 
as of december   up to  shares remained available for purchase under authorized share purchase programs 
based upon the per share closing price of its common stock as of december   the holding company would utilize million in order to purchase all of the remaining authorized shares 
for the holding company to complete these share purchases  it will likely require dividend distributions from the bank 
contractual obligations the bank has outstanding at any time  a significant number of borrowings in the form of fhlbny advances or repos 
the holding company also has an outstanding million non callable subordinated note payable due to mature in  and million of trust preferred borrowings from third parties due to mature in april  which is callable at any time after april the bank is obligated under leases for certain rental payments due on its branches and equipment

the bank is required to retain a recourse obligation on all loans sold under this program  which will remain in effect until either the entire portfolio of loans sold to fnma is satisfied or the bank funds claims by fnma for the full balance of the recourse obligation 
in addition  as part of its loan origination business  the bank has outstanding commitments to extend credit to third parties  which are subject to strict credit control assessments

net interest income depends on the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and the interest rate earned or paid on them 
the following tables set forth certain information relating to the company s consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december   and  and reflect the average yield on interest earning assets and average cost of interest bearing liabilities for the periods indicated 
such yields and costs are derived by dividing interest income or expense by the average balance of interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities  respectively  for the periods indicated 
average balances are derived from daily balances 
the yields and costs include fees that are considered adjustments to yields

in addition  federal funds sold and other short term investments declined million  as the bank utilized a portion of these short term assets in order to provide operational liquidity while deposit funding was declining 
partially offsetting the decline in mbs and federal funds sold and other short term investments during the year ended december   was an increase of million in real estate loans 
the increase was attributable to originations of million during the period  as interest rates offered on new loans continued to stimulate origination activity  that were partially offset by amortization of million and sales to fnma of million 
liabilities 
total liabilities decreased million during the year ended december  deposits declined million during the period  which was partially offset by an increase of million in fhlbny advances

stockholders equity 
stockholders equity increased million during the year ended december   due to net income of million  common stock issued in fulfillment of stock option exercises totaling million  tax benefits on stock options exercised totaling million  and an increase to equity of million related to amortization of the employee stock ownership plan of dime community bancshares  inc and affiliates esop and the recognition and retention plan for outside directors  officers and certain employees of dime community bancshares  inc rrp stock benefit plans 
the esop and rrp possess investments in the holding company s common stock that are recorded as reductions in stockholders equity contra equity balances 
as compensation expense is recognized on the esop and rrp  the contra equity balances are reduced  resulting in an increase to their respective equity balances 
this increase to equity offsets the decline in the company s retained earnings related to the periodic recorded esop and rrp expenses 
offsetting the increase to stockholders equity during the year ended december  were cash dividends of million and treasury stock repurchases of million during the period  along with an increase in the other comprehensive loss of  resulting primarily from the addition of a minimum pension liability of  during the period 
comparison of financial condition at december  and december  assets 
assets totaled billion at december   an increase of million from total assets of billion at december  the growth in assets occurred primarily in mbs available for sale and real estate loans  which increased million and million  respectively 
during the year ended december   the bank purchased million of mbs available for sale 
these purchases were intended to provide additional yield over other short term investments  while offering liquidity to the bank in future quarters when it may desire to deploy funds into higher yielding investments 
partially offsetting these purchases were principal payments received of million and net sales proceeds of million on mbs available for sale during the year ended december  during the year ended december   the bank experienced a reduction in the historically high levels of principal repayments on mbs available for sale that occurred during this decline reflected a reduction in mortgage refinancing activity during the period as a result of the historically high levels of prepayments during that significantly reduced the total population of mortgage backed assets likely to refinance in future years 
real estate loans including loans held for sale increased million during the year ended december  during the year ended december   real estate loan originations totaled billion  of which million were multifamily residential and commercial real estate loans 
real estate loan origination levels were driven by the continuation of the low interest rate environment during the period january through december offsetting the growth in real estate loans from originations were principal repayments totaling million during the year ended december  principal repayments  which include both regular amortization and prepayments  totaled million during the year ended december  the decline reflected a reduction in overall loan refinancing activity during the period as the record level of loan refinancing during significantly reduced the total population of loans likely to refinance in future years 
investment securities available for sale increased million during the year ended december   due primarily to purchases of million during the period that were partially offset by maturities and sales totaling million 
liabilities 
total liabilities increased million during the year ended december  deposits grew million due to the success of various sales and marketing activities during the period  with virtually all of this growth experienced in cds 
in addition  escrow and other deposits increased million during the period due to increased funding for real estate taxes 
during the year ended december   repos increased million and fhlbny advances decreased million 
see 
part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
in march  the company completed an offering of trust preferred securities in an aggregate amount of million 
the trust preferred securities  which bear a fixed interest rate of  mature on april   and are callable without penalty at any time on or after april  these borrowings were undertaken in order to obtain funding for general business activities including  but not limited to  repurchases of common stock and payment of cash dividends 
stockholders equity 
stockholders equity decreased million during the year ended december   due to the repurchase of million of treasury stock  a net decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss of million  and the payment of cash dividends of million during the period 
these reductions in stockholders equity were partially offset by net income of million  an increase to stockholders equity of million related to the issuance of common stock for the exercise of stock options and tax benefits associated with both the stock option plans for outside directors  officers and employees of dime community bancshares  inc the stock option plan and the stock option plan for outside directors  officers and employees of dime community bancshares  inc the stock option plan and collectively the stock option plans and the rrp  and an increase to equity of million related to amortization of the esop and rrp stock benefit plans 
both the esop and rrp have investments in the holding company s common stock that are recorded as contra equity balances 
as compensation expense is recognized on the esop and rrp  the contra equity balances are reduced  resulting in an increase to their respective equity balances 
this increase to equity offsets the decline in the company s retained earnings related to the periodic esop and rrp expenses that are recorded 
the stockholders equity component of other comprehensive income decreased million during the year ended december  as a result of a decline in the net unrealized gain on investment and mortgage backed securities available for sale that was attributable to increases in short term interest rates during comparison of the operating results for the year ended december  and general 
net income was million during the year ended december   a decrease of million from net income of million during the year ended december  during the comparative period  net interest income decreased million  non interest income decreased million and non interest expense decreased million  resulting in a decline in income before income tax of million 
income tax expense decreased million as a result of the decline in income before income tax 
net interest income 
net interest income for the year ended december  decreased million  to million  from million during the year ended december  the decrease was attributable to an increase of million in interest expense that was partially offset by an increase of  in interest income 
the net interest spread decreased basis points  from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december   and the net interest margin decreased basis points  from to during the same period 
the decrease in both the net interest spread and net interest margin reflected an increase of basis points in the average cost of interest bearing liabilities  due primarily to i borrowings  which possess a higher average cost than deposits  becoming a higher percentage of the overall composition of the bank s funding as a result of a runoff in deposit balances during the period see 
interest expense below  and ii increases in the average cost of money market deposits  cds and borrowings of basis points  basis points and basis points  respectively  during the comparative period  reflecting increases in short term interest rates during partially offsetting the increase in the average cost of interest bearing liabilities was an increase of basis points in the average yield on interest earning assets during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  this increase resulted primarily from a shift in the composition of interest earning assets to a higher percentage of real estate loans the bank s highest yielding interest earning asset  as well as increases in interest rates during that favorably impacted the yield on loans  investment securities and mbs added during the year 
interest income 
interest income was million during the year ended december   an increase of  from million during the year ended december  interest income on real estate loans  investment securities and other short term investments increased by million   and million  respectively  during the comparative period 
partially offsetting these increases was a decline of million in interest income on mbs 
the increase in interest income on real estate loans and investment securities resulted primarily from growth in their average balances of million and million  respectively  during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the growth in the average balance of real estate loans reflected real estate loan originations of million during the year ended december   which were partially offset by principal repayments and loan sales during the period 
partially offsetting the increase in interest income on real estate loans that resulted from growth in their average balance was a decline in their average yield of basis points during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   due to continued loan satisfaction  prepayment and refinancing activities during the year ended december  since the average interest rate on the loans that satisfied  prepaid and or refinanced during this period was higher than the average yield on the remaining loan portfolio  the average yield on real estate loans declined throughout the period 
long term interest rates  from which the interest rates on loan originations are derived  did not increase proportionally to the increases in short term interest rates that occurred during the year ended december  and remained near historically low levels during the year ended december  the increase in the average balance of investment securities reflected the purchase of investment securities available for sale totaling million during the year ended december  the average yield on investment securities increased basis points during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  due to increases in short term interest rates during since the company s investment securities portfolio is predominantly short and medium term in nature  its overall yield was favorably impacted by the increases in interest rates 
the increase in interest income on federal funds and other short term investments resulted from an increase of basis points in their average yield  reflecting an increase of basis points in short term interest rates during  and an increase of million in their average balance due to management s decision to maintain a higher level of federal funds sold and other short term investments during a period of rising short term interest rates and flat or minimally rising long term interest rates 
the decline in interest income on mbs during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  resulted from a decreased average balance of million resulting from both the sale of million of mbs and principal repayments of million during the year ended december  that was partially offset by an increase of basis points in average yield during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  resulting from increases in short term interest rates during 
interest expense 
interest expense increased million  to million  during the year ended december   from million during the year ended december  the growth in interest expense resulted primarily from increases of million and million in interest expense on borrowings and cds  respectively 
during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   the average balance of borrowings increased million as a result of the effects upon the computation of average balance of million of repos and a million trust preferred borrowing that were added during and remained outstanding throughout the entire year ended december  the average cost of borrowed funds increased basis points during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  due to the replacement of maturing low cost short term borrowings while short term interest rates rose during the year ended december  the increase in interest expense on cds resulted from both an increase in their average cost of basis points and an increase in their average balance of million during the comparative period 
the increase in average cost resulted from increases in short term interest rates during the year ended december   as a great majority of the bank s cds outstanding at december matured during this period 
the increase in average balance of cds reflected million of cds added during the year ended december   as a portion of the bank s non promotional interest rate money market depositors elected to move their balances into cds as interest rates offered on cds became more attractive compared to money markets 
partially offsetting the increase in interest expense on cds and borrowings was a decline of million in interest expense on money market accounts 
this resulted from a decrease of million in their average balance during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   that was partially offset by an increase of basis points in their average cost during the period 
since management of the bank elected to maintain the non promotional interest rates offered on money markets constant during a period of rising short term interest rates  the bank experienced an above average level of attrition in non promotional money market accounts  the majority of which flowed out of the bank and into other financial institutions or bank cds see

non interest income 
non interest income decreased million  to million  during the year ended december   from million during the year ended december  during the year ended december   the company recorded a net loss of million on the sale of investment securities and mbs see 
part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
during the year ended december   the company recorded net gains of  on the sale of investment and mortgage backed securities 
the decline in non interest income further resulted from decreased prepayment fee income included in other non interest income of million caused by a decrease in refinancings driven by the increases in interest rates during although refinancings and prepayments declined during this period  they continued to remain above their historical averages during the year ended december  service charges and other fees declined  during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   due primarily to a reduction of  in retail deposit fees  reflecting both reduced customer fee based activities and competitive fee policies implemented in the local market 
non interest expense 
non interest expense was million during the year ended december   a decrease of million from the year ended december  the benefit costs associated with the esop and rrp declined million during the comparative period due to both a reduction in the level of allocated shares during the year ended december   attributable to a decrease in the anticipated loan principal repayment to be made on the underlying esop borrowing that became effective january   along with a reduction in the average price of the company s common stock from which the recorded esop expense is derived 
salaries and employee benefits increased  during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   reflecting both additional staffing and general salary increases during the year ended december   offset by a reduction to expense related to the benefit maintenance plan of dime community bancshares  inc bmp  reflecting management s decision to forego the defined contribution portion of bmp benefits earned in data processing costs decreased  during the comparative period due to cost savings associated with the new data systems implemented in november other expenses declined  during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   due primarily to the reduction of  in the core deposit intangible expense associated with the company s acquisition of financial bancorp  inc  which fully amortized in january income tax expense 
income tax expense decreased million during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   due primarily to a decline of million in income before income tax 
a decline in the effective tax rate to during the year ended december  compared to during the year ended december  resulted from the tax impact of the loss recorded from the sale of investment and mortgage backed securities during the quarter ended june  comparison of the operating results for the years ended december  and general 
net income was million during the year ended december   a decrease of million from net income of million during the year ended december  during this comparative period  net interest income decreased million  non interest income decreased million and non interest expense increased million  resulting in a decline in income before income taxes of million 
income tax expense decreased million as a result of the reduced income before income taxes 
net interest income 
net interest income for the year ended december  decreased million to million from million during the year ended december  this decrease was attributable to a decline of million in interest income that was partially offset by a decline of million in interest expense during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the net interest spread decreased basis points from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december   and the net interest margin decreased basis points from to during the same period 
the decrease in both the net interest spread and net interest margin reflected a basis point decline in the average yield on interest earning assets as a result of the continued repricing of assets during the historically low interest rate environment that has persisted over the past three years 
in addition  prior to january  the overall low interest rate environment resulted in a greater decline in the average cost of interest bearing liabilities than the decline in average yield on interest earning assets 
during the year ended december   the continued low interest rate environment created the opposite effect  resulting in a greater decline in the average yield on interest earning assets than in the average cost of interest bearing liabilities 
see section entitled 
interest income below for a further discussion of these declines 
as a result  both the net interest spread and the net interest margin  which had increased during most of and  declined during the year ended december  during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   the average yield on real estate loans and mbs  which collectively comprised the great majority of the company s interest earning assets  declined by basis points and basis points  respectively see the discussion entitled 
interest income below for a further examination of these declines 
partially offsetting the decline in the average yield on interest earning assets was a reduction of basis points in the average cost of interest bearing liabilities 
this resulted primarily from declines in the average cost of borrowings of basis points and a decline in the average cost of cds of basis points  coupled with the movement of the overall composition of funding from higher cost borrowings into deposits with a lower average cost see the discussion entitled 
interest expense below for a further examination of these declines 
interest income 
interest income was million during the year ended december   a decrease of million from million during the year ended december  interest income on real estate loans  investment securities and other short term investments declined by million   and  respectively  during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  partially offsetting these declines was an increase of million in interest income on mbs during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december the decline in interest income resulted from the historically low interest rate environment that existed during the period january  through december  that environment stimulated the refinancing and prepayment of higher rate loans in the bank s portfolio  while also resulting in reduced rates on existing portfolio loans that repriced during the period january  to december  although the levels of refinancing and prepayment did experience a slight decline during the year ended december  as a result of an increase in interest rates 
the combination of these two factors resulted in a decline of basis points in the average yield on real estate loans the bank s largest interest earning asset during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  in addition  the average yield on mbs declined basis points during the same period as a result of the high level of prepayments on portfolio securities during and as well as the purchase of new securities during the period january  through december  while rates were historically low 
finally  as a result of the low interest rate environment  the average yields on investment securities and other short term investments also declined by basis points and basis points  respectively  during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the bank s general policy has been to emphasize growth in real estate loans as its primary interest earning asset  and de emphasize its investment and mbs portfolios  while loan origination demand is strong 
however  as part of a specific investment strategy to achieve a desirable balance of yield and liquidity on short term investments  the bank purchased million of mbs during the year ended december  this purchase level exceeded the level of mbs principal repayments of million during the same period  and contributed to an overall increase of million in the average balance of mbs during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  as a result  the dollar amount of interest income on mbs increased by million during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   despite the decline in average yield of basis points during the same period 
interest expense 
interest expense declined million  to million during the year ended december   from million during the year ended december  the decrease resulted primarily from a reduction of million in interest expense on borrowed funds  due to a decline of basis points in the average cost of borrowed funds during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  during the twelve months ended december   the company reduced its total borrowings by million by either not replacing borrowings that matured or prepaying outstanding debt 
during the year ended december   the company incurred million of expense on prepaid borrowings  which increased the average cost of borrowed funds by basis points during the period 
during the year ended december   the company added million of repos  and a million trust preferred borrowing 
the repos were added during the period of historically low interest rates  and  therefore  possessed a lower average cost than the existing average cost within the company s total portfolio of borrowings  which was not materially impacted by the increases in short term interest rates that occurred during the period june through december the trust preferred borrowing added basis points to the average cost of borrowings during the year ended december  the combination of activity in these two periods resulted in an overall increase of million in the average balance of borrowings during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   but a decline of basis points in their average cost 
during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   the average cost of cds  the next largest component of interest expense during the period  declined by basis points  while their average balance increased by million 
the combination of these two events resulted in a reduction in interest expense of  during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the decline in interest rates offered on cds reflected the continued low level of interest rates paid during the period january  through december   which was not materially impacted by the increase in short term interest rates that occurred during the period june through december the increase in the average balance of cds during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  resulted from new promotional cds added during the year ended december  the average cost of savings accounts declined by basis points during the comparative period  resulting in a  reduction in interest expense 
the decline in average cost reflected reductions in interest rates paid by the bank as a result of the overall interest rate environment in effect during  which was not materially impacted by the increase in short term interest rates that occurred during the period june through december interest expense on money market accounts increased million during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   due to an increase in average balance of million during the period 
the increase in average balance reflected successful deposit gathering promotions during the period july  to september  partially offsetting the increase was a decline in the average cost of money market accounts of basis points  reflecting reductions in interest rates paid by the bank as a result of the overall low interest rate environment in effect during  which was not materially impacted by the increase in short term interest rates from june through december provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses was approximately  during both the years ended december  and

item business allowance for loan losses non interest income 
non interest income decreased million  to million  during the year ended december   from million during the year ended december  the decline resulted primarily from decreased prepayment fee income of million  due to a decrease in refinancing driven by the significant levels of refinancing that occurred during  as well as increases in interest rates during the second half of the decline in prepayment fee income was partially offset by an increase of million in the net gain recorded on the sale of loans  investment securities and mbs 
during the year ended december   the net gain on the sale of loans was  during the year ended december   the company recorded a net gain of million on the sale of loans primarily multifamily residential to fnma 
increases in interest rates during reduced the level of gain recorded on loans sold from the bank s portfolio to fnma 
the gain on portfolio loan sales to fnma was significantly higher during  when rates were at historic lows 
during the year ended december   the company recorded a net gain of  on the sale of investment and mortgage backed securities 
during the year ended december   the company recorded a net loss of million on the sale of investment and mortgage backed securities 
the sale of securities and associated loss during the year ended december  were incurred in connection with a balance sheet restructuring performed in october non interest expense 
non interest expense was million during the year ended december   an increase of million over the year ended december  salaries and benefits decreased  primarily as a result of a reduction of million in benefits accrued under the bmp  which was partially offset by increased salaries resulting from both general salary increases and added staff 
the benefit costs associated with the esop and rrp increased million during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   due primarily to the recording of expense related to dividends paid on unallocated esop shares that commenced in data processing costs increased  during the comparative period  and were primarily due to non recurring charges approximating  associated with a data system conversion completed by the company in november  that affected loan servicing  retail deposit branch operations and accounting transaction processing 
occupancy and equipment expenses increased  due to increased maintenance and utility costs and increased depreciation expense associated with acquired furniture and fixtures 
income tax expense 
income tax expense decreased million during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   due primarily to a decline of million in income before income tax 
the effective tax rate approximated during both the years ended december  and comparison of the operating results for the year ended december  and the unaudited year ended december  general 
net income was million during the year ended december   an increase of million over net income of million during the year ended december  during this comparative period  net interest income increased million  non interest income increased million and non interest expense increased million  resulting in increased income before income tax of million 
income tax expense increased million as a result of the increased income before income tax 
net interest income 
net interest income for the year ended december  increased million  to million  from million during the year ended december  the increase was attributable to a decline of million in interest expense that was partially offset by a decline of million in interest income during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the net interest spread increased basis points from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december   and the net interest margin increased basis points from to during the same period 
the increase in both the net interest spread and net interest margin reflected a basis point decline in the average cost of interest bearing liabilities as a result of a shift in the composition of interest bearing liabilities away from higher cost borrowings towards lower cost cds  money market and other deposit accounts  and a decline of basis points in the average cost of borrowed funds basis points excluding prepayment expenses of million and million  respectively  incurred during the years ended december  and 
borrowing costs declined during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  due to declines in short term and medium term interest rates during and during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   the average balance of deposits  including non interest bearing checking accounts  increased as a result of ongoing deposit marketing promotions and customer sales activities 
in addition  the average balance of real estate loans increased during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   and the average rate on real estate loans was typically less susceptible to reductions in interest rates than other interest earning assets since real estate loans possess a longer average term to their maturity or next interest rate reset 
interest income 
interest income was million during the year ended december   a decrease of million from million during the year ended december  interest income on real estate loans and investment securities declined million and million  respectively  during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  these declines were partially offset by an increase in interest income on mbs of million during the same period 
the decline in interest income on real estate loans during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was attributable to a decrease of basis points in average yield during the period that resulted from the reduction in long term interest rates from october to june this decline in interest rates stimulated the refinancing and prepayment of higher rate loans in the bank s portfolio  while also resulting in reduced rates on existing portfolio loans that repriced during the period october  to december  partially offsetting the decline in interest income on real estate loans resulting from reductions in yield was an increase in interest income resulting from the increased average balance of real estate loans of million during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  during the year ended december   real estate loan originations totaled billion  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was the result of declines in long term interest rates experienced during the period which stimulated a wave of mortgage refinancing activities and contributed to higher property values and average loan origination amounts 
the bank s general policy has been to emphasize growth in real estate loans as its primary interest earning asset  and de emphasize its investment and mbs portfolios while loan origination demand is strong 
however  as part of a specific investment strategy to achieve a desirable balance of yield and liquidity on short term investments in the prevailing interest rate environment  the bank purchased million of mbs during the year ended december  this purchase level exceeded the level of mbs principal repayments of million and sales of million during the same period 
this resulted in an overall increase of million in the average balance of mbs during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  however  due to the continuation of low interest rates during the period october  through december   the average yield on mbs declined from during the year ended december  to during the year ended december  the combination of these factors resulted in a net increase in interest income on mbs of million during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  interest income on investment securities declined million as a result of a decline of million in average balance during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   and a reduction of basis points in the average yield on these securities during the same period 
the decline in average balance reflects maturity and call activity experienced on these securities as a result of the lower interest rate environment during the period january  through december  the decline in average yield reflects the decline in interest rates during the period january  through december   as higher coupon securities were called from the portfolio 
interest income on other short term investments decreased  during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the decline reflects the continued low level of short term interest rates during  as well as the decision by the fhlbny not to pay a cash dividend to its shareholders during the quarter ended december   which resulted in a loss of approximately  of interest income by the company 
overall  the yield on interest earning assets declined basis points from during the year ended december  to during the year ended december  the continuation of low interest rates during the period january  through december  resulted in reductions in the average yield on mbs of basis points and investment securities of basis points during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the yield on real estate loans declined by basis points during this period 
interest expense 
interest expense declined million  to million  during the year ended december   from million during the year ended december  the decline in interest expense resulted primarily from a reduction of million in interest expense on borrowed funds  which resulted from declines of million in the average balance of borrowed funds and basis points in the average cost of borrowed funds during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december during the twelve months ended december   the company prepaid million of borrowed funds  primarily higher cost repos  resulting in prepayment fees of million being added to interest expense during the year ended december  during the twelve months ended december   the company prepaid million of borrowed funds  primarily repos  resulting in prepayment fees of million being added to interest expense during the year ended december  these prepayments of borrowings resulted in the significant reduction in both average balance and average cost of borrowings during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the average cost of cds  the next largest component of interest expense  declined by basis points  resulting in a reduction in interest expense of million during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the average cost of money market accounts and savings accounts declined by basis points and basis points  respectively  during the same period  resulting in a reduction in interest cost of million and million  respectively 
these declines in average cost all reflected reductions in interest rates offered by the bank as a result of the overall interest rate environment in effect during the period january through december substantially offsetting the declines in interest cost of cds  money market accounts and savings accounts that resulted from reduced average costs was increased interest expense associated with increased average balances of million in cds  million in money market accounts and million in savings accounts during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  these increased average balances reflected successful deposit gathering promotions of the bank during the period january  to december  provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses was  during the year ended december  and  during the year ended december  during the year ended december   the company added  to its loan loss provision related to expected losses on real estate loans  and  to its loan loss provision related to expected losses on consumer loans see

during the years ended december  and  the bank recorded net gains of million and million  respectively  on the sale of loans  primarily from the sale of multifamily residential loans to fnma 
service charges and other fees increased million due primarily to increased fees on loans and deposits that resulted from both increased loan origination and attendant servicing as a result of the low interest rate environment and growth in deposit households as a result of ongoing deposit product promotions 
other non interest income increased million due to increased prepayment fee income of million  as a result of prepayments related to the low interest rate environment 
non interest expense 
non interest expense was million during the year ended december   an increase of million over the year ended december  salary and employee benefits increased  during the period due to general salary and staffing increases during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  in addition  the increase in the average price of the company s common stock during the year ended december  resulted in increased esop expense of  during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  this increase was partially offset by a decrease of  of expense associated with the rrp for which the final vesting of the original grant of  shares concluded during occupancy and equipment expense increased  during the comparative period due primarily to a renovation program on existing branches that was not eligible to be capitalized  as well as from a full year of expenses due to the addition of the glen oaks branch  which commenced operations near the end of the june  and the bay ridge branch  which commenced operations in march data processing costs increased  during the comparative period due to additional systems activity related to growth in the loan portfolio and additional deposit activity 
income tax expense 
income tax expense increased million during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   due primarily to an increase of million in income before income tax 
impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented herein have been prepared in accordance with gaap  which requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased costs of operations 
unlike industrial companies  nearly all of the company s consolidated assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on the company s consolidated performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a depository financial institution  the bank s primary source of market risk is interest rate volatility 
fluctuations in interest rates will ultimately impact the level of interest income recorded on  and the market value of  a significant portion of the bank s assets 
fluctuations in interest rates will also ultimately impact the level of interest expense recorded on  and the market value of  a significant portion of the bank s liabilities 
the largest component of the bank s interest earning assets  real estate loans  derives its current market rate primarily from either the fhlbny five year borrowing rate or the one or three year constant maturity treasury index 
as a result  the bank s interest earning assets are most sensitivity to these benchmark interest rates 
since the majority of the bank s interest bearing liabilities mature within one year  its interest bearing liabilities are most sensitive to fluctuations in short term interest rates 
neither the holding company nor the bank are subject to foreign currency exchange or commodity price risk 
in addition  the company owned no trading assets  nor did it engage in any hedging transactions utilizing derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps and caps or embedded derivative instruments that required bifurcation during the years ended december  or in the future  the company may  with appropriate board approval  engage in hedging transactions utilizing derivative instruments 
since a majority of the company s consolidated interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are located at the bank  virtually all of the interest rate risk exposure exists at the bank level 
as a result  all of the significant interest rate risk management procedures are performed at the bank level 
the bank s interest rate risk management strategy is designed to limit the volatility of net interest income and preserve capital over a broad range of interest rate movements and has the following three primary components 
assets 
the bank s largest single asset type is the adjustable rate multifamily residential loan 
multifamily residential loans typically carry shorter average terms to maturity than one to four family residential loans  thus significantly reducing the overall level of interest rate risk 
approximately of multifamily residential loans originated during the twelve months ended december  were adjustable rate  with repricing typically occurring after five or seven years  compared to approximately during the twelve months ended december  in addition  the bank has sought to include in its portfolio various types of adjustable rate one to four family loans and adjustable and floating rate investment securities  which generally have repricing terms of three years or less 
at december   adjustable rate real estate and consumer loans totaled billion  or of total assets  and adjustable rate investment securities cmos  remics  mbs issued by gses and other securities totaled million  or of total assets 
at december   adjustable rate real estate and consumer loans totaled billion  or of total assets  and adjustable rate investment securities cmos  remics  mbs issued by gses and other securities totaled million  or of total assets 
deposit liabilities 
as a traditional community based savings bank  the bank is largely dependent upon its base of competitively priced core deposits to provide stability on the liability side of the balance sheet 
the bank has retained many loyal customers over the years through a combination of quality service  convenience  and a stable and experienced staff 
core deposits  at december   were million  or of total deposits 
the balance of cds as of december  was million  or of total deposits  of which million  or  were to mature within one year 
the weighted average maturity of the bank s cds at december  was months compared to months at december  while the bank generally prices its cds in an effort to encourage the extension of the average maturities of deposit liabilities beyond one year  the decline in the average maturity of cds during the year ended december  reflected customer recognition that short term interest rates were at historically low levels and were increasing during the period 
wholesale funds 
the bank is a member of the fhlbny  which provided the bank with a borrowing line of up to million at december  the bank borrows from the fhlbny for various purposes 
at december   the bank had outstanding advances of million with the fhlbny 
the bank has authority to accept brokered deposits as a source of funds 
the bank had no outstanding brokered deposits at either december  or december  interest sensitivity gap the bank regularly monitors its interest rate sensitivity through the calculation of an interest sensitivity gap 
the interest sensitivity gap is the difference between the amount of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities anticipated to mature or reprice within a specific period 
the interest sensitivity gap is considered positive when the amount of interest earning assets anticipated to mature or reprice within a specified time frame exceeds the amount of interest bearing liabilities anticipated to mature or reprice within the same period 
conversely  the interest sensitivity gap is considered negative when the amount of interest bearing liabilities anticipated to mature or reprice within a specific time frame exceeds the amount of interest earning assets anticipated to mature or reprice within the same period 
in a rising interest rate environment  an institution with a positive interest sensitivity gap would generally be expected  absent the effects of other factors  to experience a greater increase in the yields of its assets relative to the costs of its liabilities and thus an increase in its net interest income  whereas an institution with a negative interest sensitivity gap would generally be expected to experience a decline in net interest income 
conversely  in a declining interest rate environment  an institution with a positive interest sensitivity gap would generally be expected  absent the effects of other factors  to experience a greater decline in the yields of its assets relative to the costs of its liabilities and thus a decrease in its net interest income  whereas an institution with a negative interest sensitivity gap would generally be expected to experience an increase in net interest income 
the following table sets forth the amounts of the company s consolidated interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december  which are anticipated  based upon certain assumptions  to reprice  prepay or mature in each of the time periods shown 
except as stated below  the amounts of assets and liabilities shown repricing or maturing during a particular period reflect the earlier of term to repricing or maturity of the asset or liability 
the table is intended to provide an approximation of the projected repricing of assets and liabilities which existed at december  on the basis of contractual maturities  anticipated prepayments  and scheduled rate adjustments within a three month period and selected subsequent time intervals 
for purposes of presentation in the table  the bank utilized its historical deposit attrition experience deposit decay rate for savings accounts  which it believes to be the most accurate measure 
for now  super now and money market accounts  it utilized the deposit decay rates published by the ots 
all amounts calculated in the table for both loans and mbs reflect principal balances expected to reprice as a result of anticipated principal repayments inclusive of early prepayments or as a result of contractual interest rate adjustments 
there are certain limitations inherent in the method of analysis presented in the table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may possess similar maturities or periods to repricing  they are impacted by different market forces  and may therefore react differently to changes in interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate with changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types of assets may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate loans  have features  like annual and lifetime rate caps  which restrict changes in the interest rates charged  both on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate from those assumed in the table 
finally  the ability of certain borrowers to make scheduled payments on their adjustable rate loans may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase

based upon historical repayment experience  and  where applicable  balloon payment dates 
at december   the company s consolidated balance sheet was composed primarily of assets that were estimated to mature or reprice within five years  with a significant portion maturing or repricing within one year 
in addition  the bank s deposit base was composed primarily of savings accounts  money market accounts and cds with maturities of two years or less 
at december   interest bearing liabilities estimated to mature or reprice within one year totaled billion  while interest earning assets estimated to mature or reprice within one year totaled million  resulting in a negative one year interest sensitivity gap of million  or negative of total assets 
in comparison  at december   interest bearing liabilities estimated to mature or reprice within one year totaled billion  while interest earning assets estimated to mature or reprice within one year totaled million  resulting in a negative one year interest sensitivity gap of million  or negative of total assets 
the increase in the magnitude of the one year negative interest sensitivity gap resulted from a decline in the level of mbs and federal funds sold and other short term investments maturing or repricing in one year or less  reflecting declines in their balance  from december  to december  under interest rate scenarios other than that which existed on december   the interest sensitivity gap for assets and liabilities could differ substantially based upon different assumptions about the manner in which core deposit decay rates and loan prepayments would change 
for example  the interest rate risk management model assumes that in a rising rate scenario  by paying competitive rates on non core deposits  a portion of core deposits will transfer to cds and be retained  although at higher cost 
also  in a rising interest rate environment  loan and mbs prepayment rates would be expected to slow  as borrowers postpone loan refinancings until rates again decline 
interest rate risk exposure npv compliance under guidelines established by ots thrift bulletin a  the bank also measures its interest rate risk through an analysis of the change in its npv under several interest rate scenarios 
npv is the difference between the present value of the expected future cash flows of the bank s assets and liabilities  plus the value of net expected cash flows from either loan origination commitments or purchases of securities 
generally  the fair value of fixed rate instruments fluctuates inversely with changes in interest rates 
increases in interest rates could thus result in decreases in the fair value of interest earning assets  which could adversely affect the company s consolidated results of operations if they were to be sold  or  in the case of interest earning assets classified as available for sale  reduce the company s consolidated stockholders equity  if retained 
the changes in the value of assets and liabilities due to fluctuations in interest rates reflect the interest rate sensitivity of those assets and liabilities 
under gaap  changes in the unrealized gains and losses  net of taxes  on securities classified as available for sale are reflected in stockholders equity through other comprehensive income 
as of december   the company s consolidated securities portfolio included million in securities classified as available for sale  which possessed a gross unrealized loss of million 
neither the holding company nor the bank owned any trading assets as of december  or in order to measure the bank s sensitivity to changes in interest rates  npv is calculated under market interest rates prevailing at a given quarter end pre shock scenario  and under various other interest rate scenarios rate shock scenarios representing immediate  permanent  parallel shifts in the term structure of interest rates from the actual term structure observed at quarter end 
the changes in npv between the pre shock scenario and various rate shock scenarios due to fluctuations in interest rates reflect the interest rate sensitivity of the bank s assets  liabilities  and commitments to either originate or sell loans and or purchase or sell securities that are included in the npv 
the npv ratio under any interest rate scenario is defined as the npv in that scenario divided by the present value of the assets in the same scenario the npv ratio 
an interest rate risk exposure compliance report is presented to the bank s board of directors on a quarterly basis 
the report  prepared in accordance with thrift bulletin a  compares the bank s estimated pre shock npv scenario to the estimated npvs calculated under the various rate shock scenarios 
the calculated estimates of the resulting npv ratios are compared to current limits established by management and approved by the board of directors 
the analysis that follows presents the estimated npv in the pre shock scenario and four rate shock scenarios and measures the dollar amount and percentage by which each of the rate shock scenario npvs changes from the pre shock scenario npv 
interest rate sensitivity is measured by the changes in the various rate shock scenario npv ratios from the pre shock scenario npv ratio 
at december  net portfolio value at december  dollar amount dollar change percentage change npv ratio basis point change in npv ratio npv ratio basis point change in npv ratio board approved npv limit dollars in thousands interest rate scenario basis points basis points pre shock basis points basis points n a n a the npvs presented above incorporate some asset and liability values derived from the bank s valuation model  such as those for mortgage loans and time deposits  and some asset and liability values that are provided by independent and reputable sources  such as values for the bank s mbs and cmo portfolios  as well as its putable borrowings 
the valuation model makes various estimates regarding cash flows from principal repayments on loans and passbook deposit decay rates at each level of interest rate change 
the bank s estimates for loan prepayment levels are influenced by the recent history of prepayment activity in its loan portfolio as well as the interest rate composition of the existing portfolio  especially vis vis the current interest rate environment 
in addition  the bank considers the amount of prepayment fee protection inherent in the loan portfolio when estimating future prepayment cash flows 
regarding passbook deposit decay rates  the bank tracks and analyzes the decay rate of its passbook deposits over time and over various interest rate scenarios and then makes estimates of its passbook deposit decay rate for use in the valuation model 
nevertheless  no matter the care and precision with which the estimates are derived  actual cash flows for passbooks  as well as loans  could differ significantly from the bank s estimates resulting in significantly different npv calculations 
the bank also generates a series of spot discount rates that are integral to the valuation of the projected monthly cash flows of its assets and liabilities 
the bank s valuation model employs discount rates that are representative of prevailing market rates of interest  with appropriate adjustments suited to the heterogeneous characteristics of the bank s various asset and liability portfolios 
the npv ratio at december  was in the pre shock scenario  an increase from the npv ratio of in that scenario at december  the npv ratio was in the basis point rate shock scenario at december   an increase from the npv ratio of in the basis point rate shock scenario at december  at december   the sensitivity change in the basis point rate shock scenario was basis points  compared to a sensitivity change of basis points in the basis point rate shock scenario at december  the improvement in sensitivity was primarily due to the runoff in rate sensitive promotional deposits during  as well as an increase in the npv of loans during the period 
the pre shock npv increased from million at december  to million at december  the increase in the pre shock npv was due primarily to an increase in the bank s capital  fueled by an increase in retained earnings 
in addition  the pre shock npv increased due to an increase in the intangible value ascribed to the bank s core deposits that occurred despite a decline in their balance 
the deposit intangible value increased due to an increase of approximately to basis points in the market rates of interest for terms to maturity of two years or less during the year ended december   while the bank s cost of deposits increased by substantially less 
in addition  the value of multifamily loans increased during the year ended december   reflecting an increase in portfolio rates during the period 
the increase in the pre shock scenario npv ratio reflected the increase in the pre shock scenario npv even as the value of the bank s balance sheet decreased due to declines in the balance of deposits at december  compared to december  the bank s basis point rate shock scenario npv increased from million at december  to million at december  at both december  and december   the projected value of the bank s assets and liabilities were expected to decline in the basis point rate shock scenario npv 
at december   the decline in the value of the bank s assets relative to the decline in the value of its liabilities under the basis point rate shock scenario npv was not as great as the relative decline projected at december  this was attributable primarily to an increase in the npv determined for the loans and securities in the basis point rate shock scenario during that exceeded similar increases in the npv determined for cds and borrowings in the basis point rate shock scenario during the increase in the bank s basis point rate shock scenario npv ratio at december  compared to december  reflected the increase in the basis point rate shock scenario npv at december  compared to december  the basis point rate shock scenario npv ratio increased despite a decline in the basis point rate shock scenario value of the bank s assets from december to december  that resulted from a decrease in overall asset balances 
the decline in npv asset balance was attributable to a decrease in the balance of mbs  as the bank sold million of mbs during and utilized the proceeds to replace runoff in deposits during the period 
the basis point rate shock scenario npv increased during since the basis point rate shock scenario npv liability balance declined by an even greater level than the basis point rate shock scenario npv asset balance 
the reduction in the basis point rate shock scenario npv liability balance was driven by a decline in the deposit npv
