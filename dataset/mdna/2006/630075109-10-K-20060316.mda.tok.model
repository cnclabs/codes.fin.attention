overview we were founded on the vision of providing a higher quality of healthcare through advanced diagnostic products 
we are strategically anticipating the transformation of medical care as it shifts from reactive to proactive personalized medicine 
with this vision  we have focused on developing multiple products that target specific needs within the advanced diagnostic continuum 
our products are bridging the gap between early stage scientific research and actual clinical practice 
we have organized our products into four broad categories based on their particular technologies molecular testing platforms we are a supplier of leading edge proprietary molecular testing platforms that can target a large number of specific genes at once 
these instrument platforms are for research and clinical customers dealing with more complex genetic diseases or conditions than can be adequately addressed with traditional real time pcr molecular testing 
these systems  that include the first and second generation nanochip systems  are based on our proprietary lab on a chip testing technology 
the advantage of these systems is that they allow researchers and clinics to test for diseases or conditions that would require multiple tests using real time pcr molecular testing into a single test 
an example of this is our potential cystic fibrosis test which requires specifically targeting genes sequences into a single test 
real time pcr molecular testing we are a supplier of real time pcr and analyte specific reagents asrs used in research and clinical laboratories 
these products are advanced molecular probes that focus on single genetic sequences or mutations in genes that are used as indicators of specific diseases or conditions 
point of care pipeline to fulfill the need of doctors to accurately diagnose specific diseases in the urgent critical care area  we are developing easy to use tests for identifying protein markers that play a role in diseases 
our researchers are developing products that focus on the diagnoses of congestive heart failure  of stroke and traumatic brain injury 
on february   with our acquisition of spectral s point of care assets  we acquired several revenue generating rapid cardiac immunoassay tests that broadened our menu of products available for point of care customers 
the acquired products include rapid tests for levels of ckmb  myoglobin and troponin  all of which are frequently used in cardiac care 
in addition we acquired the ability to manufacture these and other point of care products 
advanced genetic markers with our investment in jurilab in we gained access to a large database of advanced genetic markers created by studying the genetic patterns of a founder population in east finland 
this database may provide insights to the correlation of genetic patterns as a prognosticator of disease 
we expect this technology to feed the development and commercialization of our real time pcr or molecular testing platforms by adding proprietary solutions to evaluate and diagnose disease 
in addition  we expect to pursue license and royalty opportunities related to technologies that we do not wish to commercialize 

table of contents we believe through our technology and product lines we are in a unique position for growth and leadership in a rapidly emerging market 
we see a growing capability in the clinical laboratories ability to perform accurate advanced diagnostic testing as a strong validation of our strategy of investing in advanced diagnostic technologies 
in addition  the fda has recently released guidance encouraging the generation of more pharmacogenomics data and molecular diagnostic testing during drug development and clinical trials that should drive demand for our products and technologies 
we are working to achieve a definable path to profitability by focusing on the development of multiple product lines by leveraging organic and acquisitive growth  as well as licensing agreements and partnerships 
each of these product lines targets key areas of the advanced diagnostic market for their revenue and growth potential 
we are able to strategically target our product offerings in each market to determine the most profitable approach to revenue generation 
in some cases  we seek to capture vertical markets by leveraging our portfolio of genetic markers to create proprietary diagnostic reagents for a specific disease indication and own the instrumentation that uses the reagents 
this business model often called the razor razor blade where the sale of the instrument delivers strong aftermarket consumables flow 
in other markets we may out license genetic markers or reagents for platform independent instrumentation or diagnostic equipment 
liquidity developments from commencement of operations in through we applied the majority of our resources toward the development of our molecular technology instrumentation eg nanochip systems 
beginning in  in addition to our internal research and development  we commenced a targeted acquisitions strategy to acquire product lines through strategic investments or the acquisition of businesses 
in  we acquired both our real time pcr reagents and point of care businesses 
in  we invested in jurilab  ltd and in february we acquired the cardiac test business of spectral 
we will continue to consume cash and have quarterly net losses during the next several years as we manage our products life cycles from the cash consuming early stages to the mature stages were they provide a return on investment 
we have incurred negative cash flows from operations since inception and have an accumulated deficit of million 
we believe it is beneficial to maintain a significant amount of cash and short term investments to ensure we can fund our operations and provide us sufficient leverage to make financing deals that are beneficial to our current stockholders 
in addition  we believe that our existing working capital  and our access to financing combined with our current revenues will be sufficient to support our current and planned operations through at least the next twelve months 
to continue to have access to financing  in june  we filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission that permitted us to raise up to million in registered equity transactions 
in september  under our shelf registration  we issued to institutional investors a combination of approximately million shares of common stock and warrants to purchase up to approximately one million shares of common stock exercise price of per share for five years and received gross proceeds of approximately million  or million  net of expenses 
in addition  in march  we received approximately million by issuing to an investor  shares of common stock at per share 
subsequent to this filing  we have an additional million available under the shelf registration statement that could be used to issue some combination of common stock  preferred stock  debt securities or warrants 
we assume that we will have the ability to sell a sufficient amount of securities to investors to continue our strategy of expanding our product pipeline by acquiring companies or assets and supporting our on going internal product development 
without access to financing  on terms acceptable to us  we will have to cease or curtail operations and product development that may materially alter our current business strategy 
in march  we sold million shares of our common stock to institutional investors at a price of per share  for gross proceeds of approximately million 
in april  we sold an additional  shares to institutional investors at a price of per share for gross proceeds of approximately million 
after deducting fees and expenses  we received approximately million from these sales 

table of contents product sales developments with our goal of becoming one of the leading suppliers of molecular testing products in the advanced diagnostic market  we have focused on meeting the technology requirements of a large and underserved range of customers in the advance research  clinical laboratory and point of care settings 
we provide our customers the technology to identify specific molecules proteins  genes  etc 
role in a disease 
in  our real time pcr reagents and molecular testing product lines were primarily responsible for our product sales revenue 
to broaden our market for the nanochip system we have strategically developed and released in a second generation of this instrument  the nanochip system  to broaden our access to the larger clinical laboratory market and potentially  with regulatory clearance  the point of care market 
we have significant product development occurring in all four of our technology areas molecular testing platform pipeline we are focusing on the development of asrs for our second generation molecular testing system to drive demand for the system 
these consumable tests include a variety of tests from identifying specific respiratory viruses to identifying the genes commonly associated with cystic fibrosis 
molecular reagents reagents  asrs  custom assays pipeline we are making significant progress expanding our library of real time pcr and asr reagents with broad markets 
we will have released several reagents related to herpes simplex viruses and are finalizing reagents for the pertussis  parapertussis  bk viruses and the vzv virus which is principally for chicken pox or shingles 
point of care pipeline to broaden our menu of point of care products on the market  in february  we purchased of a point of care product line for cardiac testing 
one of the fda approved products we acquired is a point of care three in one test that tests for levels of ckmb  mi  and a troponin i which is frequently administered to determine cardiac health 
in addition  we acquired an ability to manufacture both the three in one test and future point of care products 
we also have a point of care product in development for congestive heart failure test that will detect levels of the protein nt probnp 
we are uncertain as to the timing of its release as we are required to complete additional testing 
in march  we received fda clearance to begin marketing our plasma based nt probnp congestive heart failure product for use on human plasma which may be marketed for use in clinical laboratories 
for the larger point of care market  our nt probnp congestive heart failure product for use on human whole blood remains under development 
advanced genetic markers we continue to study the database of advanced genetic markers for potential commercialization 
in  we also gained access to a large database of advance genetic markers with our investment in jurilab ltd 
this may feed the development of our real time pcrs or molecular instrument s consumable test suites by adding proprietary solutions to evaluate and diagnose disease 
license fee and royalty income developments our agreement with applied biosystems inc applied biosystems with the underlining patents expiring at various dates between and provided us approximately million in revenues in after october  our contractual quarterly minimum royalty payments expired and became based on actual sales 
in january  we renegotiated our contract with applied biosystems to maintain quarterly payments through december  and actual royalties thereafter 
although we expect this relationship to continue into the foreseeable future this contract can be terminated with a day notice 

table of contents in addition  with our growing intellectual property profile of us patents and with our relationship with jurilab  ltd  we are continuing to evaluate royalty and licensing opportunities and we may choose to license our technology in the future  if we believe the terms and conditions are acceptable 
contracts and grants developments we fund some of our research and development efforts through contracts and grants awarded by various federal  state and private agencies 
revenue is recognized under these contracts and grants as expenses are incurred 
we do not believe these grants will be our primary source of on going revenue but will offset some of our research and development costs 
the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases for the national institutes of health nih provided us additional funding this year for several grants 
in march  we received a grant for a total of  over a two year period to start the second phase of the development of a central micro fluidics based pathogen analyzer 
in july  we received a grant for a total of million over four years for the diagnosis of sepsis and community acquired pneumonia 
in july  the university of washington received a grant from the bill and melinda gates foundation as the lead partner of a consortium to develop a portable device that healthcare workers could pack into remote regions to make life saving diagnoses 
our portion of this grant is anticipated to be approximately million 
this consortium  which included us  will concentrate on the development of an affordable portable device to conduct point of care testing and provide rapid results 
our portion of the revenue under this grant totaled  in the year ended december  sponsored research developments in july  we executed a ten year agreement with hitachi  ltd  nissei sangyo co 
ltd 
and hitachi instruments service co 
ltd 
of japan collectively  hitachi to develop  manufacture and distribute potential products based on the parties proprietary technologies 
at a minimum  we were required to match the hitachi contribution to our research and development on an annual basis over a ten year period 
in addition  we are required to repay of hitachi s contributions to research and development with no interest over an indefinite period of time 
from the inception of the collaboration agreement with hitachi through the termination of the agreement in august  we received a total of million in sponsored research funding 
half of this funding was recorded as revenue and the remaining half is recorded as a long term liability 
we recognized the last  in revenue from hitachi in and do not expect any revenue from this agreement in the future 
at december  we owe approximately million to hitachi and the repayment amount is determined as of our gross sales of asrs used on molecular testing platforms 
acquisitions  investments and goodwill developments we actively and selectively seek to acquire or invest in companies with complementary products and strong intellectual property positions to allow us to penetrate emerging markets 
we anticipate using a combination of cash and common stock to purchase future companies or assets 
spectral diagnostics inc asset purchase on february  we acquired the rapid cardiac immunoassay point of care test business of spectral diagnostics inc spectral 
the total purchase price was approximately million that was comprised of million in cash and  shares of our common stock valued at approximately million on the date of acquisition 
in addition  we are required to use our best efforts to register the shares issued in this transaction with the securities and exchange commission within fifteen days of closing of the acquisition 
we did not register these shares by this date and there is a cash settlement provision in the asset purchase agreement related to the difference between the closing price of a share and the future closing price of the shares when they 
table of contents are registered 
if the share price has fallen more than from the february  closing price or a share on the date of registration we maybe required to pay spectral in cash for the difference 
the maximum liability is  in canadian dollars 
conversely  if our share price increases more than above the closing price or under certain circumstances spectral maybe required to refund us cash for the difference between the closing price and the increase in price 
the maximum refund is  canadian dollars 
we have not recorded the value of this cash settlement option on our books as of december  as the purchase price and results of this business s operations will be consolidated within our financial statements beginning february  we will account for this acquisition under the purchase method of accounting and  as of the date of this report  we have not allocated the purchase price to this business s assets 
jurilab  ltd investment in july  we invested approximately million in cash into jurilab ltd jurilab to acquire of the outstanding stock and obtain effective control of the board of directors 
we anticipate making a second equity investment in jurilab in in addition  we have the option to purchase the entire company in cash or stock at not to exceed prices through december  we believe that this investment strategy is an effective use of our cash  because it provides us approximately two years to evaluate jurilab s technology for potential commercialization and integration into our product lines before we commit to purchasing the entity 
based on our analysis of the jurilab investment agreement we are considered the primary beneficiary under fin r consolidation of variable interest entities 
we are the primary beneficiary because jurilab s equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit jurilab to finance its activities without additional support  we have the direct ability through the board of directors to make decisions about their activities  and our equity interest is not proportional to the losses we will take from the research and development expenses 
in addition  substantially all of jurilab s activities are conducted on our behalf despite our disproportionate ownership percentage 
therefore  we have consolidated jurilab s operations into our financial results  however  their creditors have no recourse against us and our maximum exposure to loss is the million we have invested in the entity 
conversely  assets recognized as a result of consolidating do not represent additional assets that could be used to satisfy claims against our general assets 
included in our consolidated balance sheet at december  were the net liabilities in thousands of jurilab december  unaudited cash restricted cash other assets debt obligations other long term liabilities net liabilities consolidation of jurilab s results of operations included the following from july  to december  unaudited net sales cost of product sales research and development expense other income net loss 
table of contents pharmacogenetics diagnostic laboratory  llc in july  we invested  in pharmacogenetics diagnostic laboratory  llc pgx  a development stage research and development company  to provide us access to certain technology related to pharmacogenetics 
we may increase our investment to an aggregate amount of approximately  if pgx reaches certain agreed upon milestones 
we conducted a sensitivity analysis that considered both the qualitative and quantitative factors of our initial and potential additional investments in pgx to consider if we should consolidate pgx as a vie under fin we did not consider pgx a vie because we believe it is likely pgx will obtain additional and operating funding from other third parties 
moreover  even if pgx were a vie  its creditors have no recourse against us and our maximum exposure to pgx s losses is the extent of our investment 
therefore  we will expense pgx s net losses to research and development 
once our investment  which is carried as other long term assets  is reduced to zero  we will stop recording the results of operations of pgx in our financials 
we believe this appropriately reflects the substance of this transaction  which is to fund research and development 
for the year ended december  we have expensed  of pgx s net losses into research and development 
fastraq  inc in june  we signed a letter of agreement with fastraq  inc fastraq for the development of a certain future product 
in october and december we amended this letter of agreement 
in february  we converted this letter of agreement into two executed contracts  a development and license agreement and a collaboration agreement 
our chief executive officer and chairman of the board  mr 
birndorf  is a director and an investor in fastraq 
mr 
birndorf abstained from all the discussions and votes regarding fastraq at the meetings of our board of directors 
as a result of these agreements and related amendments we made an initial non refundable payment of  in to begin the initial development of this product and we will provide fastraq an additional  in funding through april in addition  in  we paid  to purchase a certain product from them 
as of december    had been expensed 
we are also obligated to supply materials at no cost to be used in the development of this technology and pay fastraq up to  based on meeting certain research milestones 
acquisition of synx pharma inc and epoch biosciences  inc 
as a part of our long term strategy to build a stronger company with products to serve the advanced diagnostic marketplace  in  we identified synx pharma inc synx and epoch biosciences  inc 
epoch as businesses operating in market niches that were complementary to our existing business 
in addition  they provided us the opportunity to broaden our product lines in the proteomics technology pipeline eg point of care and real time pcr diagnostic markets 
therefore  we acquired synx and epoch in all stock transactions on april  and december   respectively 
in these acquisitions we recognized million in goodwill 
a factor that led to this goodwill valuation was our belief that we would increase our sales revenue by selling their current and future products with our existing sales and marketing infrastructure 
in addition  we believed there were numerous redundant operational and administrative functions  which could be combined within the consolidated company at a cost savings 
we utilized a third party to perform a valuation analysis related to the intangible assets of synx and epoch as of their respective acquisition dates 
we reviewed the assumptions  calculations and conclusions of this valuation analysis for accuracy and reasonableness 
we recognized identified intangible assets in our acquisitions if we could identify an asset from contractual or other legal rights or if the asset is separable from the business 
we considered an asset separable if it a was capable of being sold  transferred  licensed  rented or exchanged or b can be transferred in combination with a related asset or liability 
we then identified the intangible assets in synx and epoch in the following areas marketing  customer relationships  artistic creation  contracts and technologies 
for technologies acquired  we used the prescribed methodology set forth in sfas no 

table of contents accounting for research and development expense and fasb interpretation no 
applicability of fasb statement no 
to business combinations accounted for by the purchase method collectively sfas no 
to determine whether a technology was to be classified as completed or as in process research and development ipr d 
pursuant to the above guidelines  we assessed the value and future applications of technology assets to be used in ipr d projects 
we expensed technologies determined to have no alternative future use 
completed technologies were recorded at their fair value and will be amortized over its estimated remaining useful life 
in process research and development developments we used the prescribed methodology set forth in sfas no 
to determine the technology required to be classified as ipr d in our synx and epoch acquisitions 
we determined that we had no ipr d in our epoch acquisition 
in our synx acquisition we had ipr d related to congestive heart failure chf  traumatic brain injury tbi and diabetes diagnostic products as these applications were determined to be unique to our research and development efforts at the time of the acquisition 
to determine the value assigned to the acquired ipr d we used a third party valuation specialist and we reviewed their calculations and conclusions for reasonableness and accuracy 
we began by estimating the expenses required to develop the acquired ipr d into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting cash flows from the products and discounting the net cash flows to their present values and to reflect the risks associated with the development of the products 
the discount rates used ranged from to reflecting the inherent risks involved in launching complex diagnostic products 
in addition  these calculations were adjusted to reflect the creation efforts which were made prior to the close of the acquisition 
at the time of the acquisition  the chf product was the closest to completion  and expected to be launched in the tbi and diabetes products are still in the early stages of the development cycle 
therefore we allocated million in fair value to chf   in fair value to tbi and  in fair value for diabetes diagnostics and as prescribed by fin the million in ipr d assets were expensed at the date of acquisition 
the development of medical diagnostic devices is subject to a number of risks  including development  regulatory and marketing risks 
there can be no assurance our development stage products will overcome these hurdles and become commercially viable products or gain commercial acceptance 
we did not have accurate estimates as to the resources required to launch these products at the time of the acquisition 
we fund the development of these products with our working capital 
as of december   none of these products has been commercialized 
goodwill impairment analysis developments in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we do not amortize goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 
in  using the purchase method of accounting we recorded goodwill with our acquisitions of synx and epoch that represented the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible net assets 
this goodwill was subject to our quarterly reviews for indicators of impairment 
during our first three quarterly reviews in there were no material events or changes in circumstances to indicate that the carrying amount of our goodwill might not be recoverable 
therefore  we performed our required annual goodwill impairment testing during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 
we allocated our goodwill assets to our epoch and synx reporting units and performed our goodwill testing to determine if the reporting units carrying amount including goodwill was greater than its fair value 
to determine the estimated fair value of the reporting units we used a third party to perform a valuation analysis of our reporting units  while we reviewed their assumptions  calculations and conclusions for reasonableness and accuracy 
we determined that the carrying amount of the reporting unit that included epoch was in excess of its fair value 
the fair value was based on a combination of the income approach  which estimates the fair value based on the future discounted cash flows  and the market approach  which estimates the fair value based on comparable market 
table of contents prices 
under the income approach  we assumed a cash flow period through with terminal values thereafter  long term annual revenue growth rates of to  a discount rate of and terminal value growth rates of 
we determined that the fair value of the reporting unit related to epoch was approximately million 
therefore  we incurred a non cash impairment charge to our goodwill of million  which did not affect our liquidity 
we believe we have taken an appropriate valuation approach to determine the fair value of this goodwill asset  however  because there is no exact method to derive the value of a goodwill asset we had to make significant assumptions as to the ratio of market approach verses a income approach 
had we changed the following assumptions our goodwill asset and related impairment charge would have changed by the following amounts assumption market approach income approach goodwill valuation resulting goodwill impairment charge our valuation approach pure income approach pure market approach development and manufacturing agreement with princeton biomeditech corporation pbm developments through synx we were a party to a development and manufacturing agreement between synx and princeton biomeditech corporation pbm to jointly develop and market various point of care tests for certain biomarkers and protein targets 
as of january  we terminated all of our previous agreements with pbm and superseded them with renegotiated contracts 
these agreements include a manufacturing and distribution agreement and a development agreement 
there were no payments between us and pbm associated with entering into these revised agreements and there were no minimum purchase requirements between the parties 
we agreed to continue the joint development of a point of care instrument that incorporates pbm s proprietary technology  our proprietary reagents and an exclusive license between us and roche diagnostics gmbh 
pbm is responsible for the development of a reasonably priced instrument that uses our reagents to determine the amount of target nt probnp present in a patient 
in addition  pbm is required to obtain the regulatory approval of the instrument and will own these approvals 
we will fund a portion of the development cost of the instrument  up to an agreed upon maximum amount 
in addition  we are required to develop and manufacture the reagents used in the instrument and supply them to pbm 
we also have to conduct the testing of our reagents required to obtain regulatory approval to market and sell them 
we will own these regulatory approvals 
further  we will share revenues associated with this point of care instrument with the majority of revenues being allocated to the party responsible for selling  marketing and distributing the instrument within a specific geographic territory 
each party will be responsible for its own manufacturing  sales and marketing expenses and both parties are required to provide each other a forecast of expected demand for each others product reagents or instruments 
we provided pbm with an option to purchase or to receive a nonexclusive license for certain biological markers for the incorporation into a future point of care instrument related to congestive heart failure  stroke or traumatic brain injury 
we have agreed to negotiate in good faith commercially reasonable terms for such a license or supply arrangement 
however  if we are unable to agree upon such terms pbm will pay nanogen a certain royalty for use of these markers 
in july we ordered and paid approximately  for instruments from pbm 

table of contents fda regulations developments the fda requires that many of our micro array instrumentation asr consumable test suites and real time pcr products are to be used only for research purposes or by clia certified laboratories when developing and validating their own diagnostic tests 
when we begin to distribute and manufacture products for non clia laboratories and point of care customers  we are subject to additional fda requirements such as pre market applications 
additionally  some of these same sites and products are intended to comply with certain voluntary quality programs such as iso or iso in march  we received fda clearance to begin marketing our plasma based nt probnp congestive heart failure product for use on human plasma which may be marketed for use in clinical laboratories 
for the larger point of care market  our nt probnp congestive heart failure product for use on human whole blood remains under development 
in the third quarter of  we received an untitled letter from the office of in vitro diagnostic devise evaluation and safety oivd  a division of the fda 
the letter described the oivd s concerns that the microarray nanochip systems and certain related asrs might be construed as a closed system and therefore a medical device that requires a pre market application 
we believe that our microarray nanochip systems and the related asrs are independent and are not marketed or intended as a closed system 
if there is an unfavorable decision in this matter it could delay sales of our nanochip to clinical laboratories in the united states 
during  we plan to submit the nanochip with one or more assays to the fda for clearance 
other manufacturing except for our custom real time pcr products and specialized manufacturing production businesses  which are make to order businesses  we principally manufacture products for inventory and ship products shortly after the receipt of orders  and anticipate that we will continue to do so in the future 
we do not currently have a significant backlog and do not anticipate we will develop a material backlog in the near future 
in addition  we rely on third party manufacturers to supply many of our raw materials  product components  and in some cases  entire products 
hitachi manufactures our nanochip systems and we manufacture the majority of our consumable products in our manufacturing facilities in san diego  california and bothell  washington 
in february  we purchased a point of care product line from spectral diagnostics  inc and acquired the ability to manufacture the associated future point of care products in our facilities in toronto  canada 
fluctuations we anticipate that our results of operations will fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis and will be difficult to predict 
the timing and degree of fluctuations will depend upon several factors  including those discussed under item a risk factors 
in addition  the timing of orders from distributors and the mix of sales between our product lines could affect our results of operations 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to achieve revenue growth on a quarterly or annual basis 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and disclosure of 
table of contents contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  valuation of inventory  intangible assets and investments  income taxes  and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical and anticipated results and trends and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  including assumptions as to future events 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
by their nature  estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
actual results that differ from our estimates could have a significant adverse effect on our operating results and financial position 
we consider an accounting estimate and policy to be critical if the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made  and changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  or the use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period  would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies and assumptions may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than others 
liquidity we expect that our access to financing  including the march sale of our common stock at per share for net proceeds of approximately million  combined with our existing capital resources  anticipated product revenues  license fees and contract and grant funding will be sufficient to support our planned operations  at least through the next twelve months 
as we continue to consume cash and have quarterly net losses we are required to make significant assumptions about our operating cash requirements and our ability to continue to raise capital to finance our on going operations 
we assume that we will have the ability to sell a sufficient amount of securities to investors to continue our strategy of expanding our product pipeline by acquiring companies or assets and supporting our on going internal product development 
without access to this financing  on terms acceptable to us  we will have to cease or curtail operations and product development that may materially alter our current business strategy 
valuation of goodwill  intangible assets and investments we have recorded as assets million of goodwill and other intangibles in our december  consolidated financial statements 
we used significant estimates and assumptions to determine the value of these assets 
in many cases we use a third party to perform a valuation analysis on these assets  while we review their assumptions  calculations and conclusions for reasonableness and accuracy 
we test goodwill for possible impairment on an annual basis 
this testing requires that we make judgments to identify our reporting units and significantly effects our valuation analysis 
in addition  we test goodwill for possible impairment if events occur or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable 
we assess potential impairments to these intangible assets when there is evidence that events or circumstances indicate that the recorded value of an asset the carrying amount may not be recovered 
these assessments are based on judgments and estimates of the materiality of various on going events and circumstances related to the asset 
indicators of impairment may include the inability to meet prior revenue estimates  inconsistent operational performance  lack of future potential  or other factors 
the estimates and assumptions we use are consistent with our internal planning and there are inherent uncertainties in this assessment process as it is difficult to model all possible future events 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record an impairment charge on all or a portion of our goodwill or intangible assets 
any resulting impairment loss could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue principally from real time pcr products both custom and proprietary tests  molecular testing platforms the nanochip systems  asrs  sponsored research  contract and grant agreements and from license and royalty fees for intellectual property 
each element of revenue recognition requires a certain 
table of contents amount of judgment to determine if the following criteria have been met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  iii the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  iv collectibility is reasonably assured  and v both title and the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the buyer 
we are required to make more significant estimates involving our recognition of revenue from license and royalty fees  than from revenue generated from our products sales and contracts and grant agreements 
our license and royalty fees revenue estimates depend upon on our interpretation of the specific terms of each individual arrangement and our judgment to determine if the arrangement has more than one deliverable and how each of these deliverables should be measured and allocated to revenue 
in addition  we have to make significant estimates about the useful life of the technology transferred to determine when the risk and rewards of ownership have transferred to the buyer to decide the period of time to recognize revenue 
in certain circumstances we are required to make judgments about the reliability of third party sales information and recognition of royalty revenue before actual cash payments for these royalties have been received 
inventory and related reserves we have a history of writing down the value of our inventory due to lack of market demand 
we have approximately million of finished goods inventory as of december  given the inherent unpredictability of demand for new product lines  we were required to make significant estimates about the future demand for this inventory 
our estimates of realizable value are based upon our analysis and assumptions including  but not limited to  forecasted sales levels by product  expected product lifecycle  product development plans and future demand requirements 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than our forecasts or actual demand from our customers is lower than our estimates  we may be required to record additional inventory write downs 
if actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated  inventory previously written down may be sold  resulting in lower cost of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period 
variable interest entities we provide various forms of funding into other entities for business purposes 
examples of these include our investments into jurilab  fastraq and pgx 
finr consolidation of variable interest entities requires that we make significant assumptions about these entities ability to generate unrelated additional capital funding and or revenues 
in addition  we are required to make assumptions about the intentions of unrelated parties initial and potential future investments to determine if we are required to consolidate or de consolidate these entities 
if any of these facts  circumstances or assumptions change in the future we maybe required to consolidate or de consolidate these entities operations 
income taxes we regularly review our established valuation allowance against our potential tax assets that is based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies 
as of december   our valuation allowance was million 

table of contents results of operations years ended december   and revenues the following table summarizes our revenues for the years ended december   and in thousands year ended december  year ended december  difference difference product sales license fee and royalty income sponsored research contracts and grants total product sales revenue is primarily generated from real time pcr products both custom and proprietary tests  molecular testing platforms nanochip systems and asrs 
product sales revenue grew in as compared to and due to additional revenue generated from real time pcr products acquired through the acquisition of epoch in december revenue from our first generation molecular testing platform and related consumables fell in and by approximately and when compared to revenue 
this was primarily due to price reductions of the first generation molecular testing system in and to clear excess inventory 
we released the second generation of our molecular testing system  the nanochip  in the fourth quarter of however  we did not generate enough revenue from the new system to offset the prior years price reduction of the first generation system 
the future the downward trend in sales revenue for the first generation molecular testing platform was primarily due to a lack of a broad menu of asrs that may be used on the system to drive demand for the system beyond the limited market for the research customer 
in  we began to address the much larger clinical diagnostic laboratory market by starting the development of our second generation molecular testing system  the nanochip  which was designed specifically to meet the needs of the clinical diagnostic user 
in the fourth quarter of  we released the nanochip therefore we expect a modest increase in revenue in demand for this system will be driven primarily by our future development and commercial acceptance of a menu of reagents that may be run on the nanochip in  we expect a modest increase in revenue from asrs used to detect genetic sequence of respiratory viruses and cystic fibrosis which should drive demand for the nanochip from the clinical diagnostic laboratory market 
however  before we gain commercial acceptance of our asrs from the clinical diagnostic customer we may require regulatory clearance from the fda to market the device as a closed system 
we expect growth in revenues from our custom and real time pcr products as we are making significant progress expanding our library of real time pcr and asr reagents with broad markets 
in  we plan to release several reagents related to herpes simplex viruses and are finalizing reagents for the pertussis  parapertussis  bk viruses and the vzv virus which is principally for chicken pox or shingles 
to broaden our menu of point of care products on the market  in february  we purchased of a point of care product line for cardiac testing 
these products are now on the market and we should see revenue from these products in the first quarter of the point of care product in development that is closest to commercialization is our congestive heart failure test that will detect levels of the protein nt probnp 
although we believe we are currently in the final stages of the development of this product  we are uncertain as to the timing of its release as we are required to receive final fda clearance for distribution 
license fees include nonrefundable fees generated from the licensing of our technology with third parties 
license fees and royalty income increased in as compared to and due to the 
table of contents royalty bearing licensing agreement with applied biosystems for the taqman nuclease real time pcr assays 
license fees increased in from primarily due to contractual minimum royalties from combimatrix as a result of a litigation settlement in the future after october  our contractual quarterly minimum royalty payments with applied biosystems expired and became based on actual sales 
in january  we renegotiated the contract with applied biosystems to maintain minimum quarterly payments through december  and actual royalties thereafter 
although we expect this relationship to continue into the foreseeable future this contract can be terminated with a day notice 
in addition  with our growing intellectual property profile of us patents and with our relationship with jurilab  ltd  we are continuing to evaluate royalty and licensing opportunities and we may choose to license our technology in the future  if we believe the terms and conditions are acceptable 
sponsored research revenue is nonrefundable money generated through the development agreement with hitachi see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the decrease in sponsored research revenue directly relates to the termination of the hitachi collaborative research agreement in august funding through this agreement was completed in the second quarter of the future with the termination of our sponsored research agreement with hitachi completed in the second quarter of we do not expect any revenue from hitachi in or thereafter 
we may enter into additional sponsored research projects in the future 
contracts and grants revenue is nonrefundable payments by various federal  state and private agencies for our research and development efforts awarded through contracts and grants 
contracts and grants revenue is recorded as the costs and expenses to perform the research are incurred  if the amount is reasonably commensurate with the effort expended and collection of the payment is reasonably assured 
under certain arrangements where funding is provided contractually on a scheduled basis  revenue is recorded ratably over the term of the arrangement 
payments received in advance under these arrangements are recorded as deferred revenue until the expenses are incurred 
the decrease in contract and grant revenue in as compared to primarily related to revenue generated in from a bill and melinda gates foundation grant and two new nih grants not offsetting the winding down of several contracts entered into in previous years 
the decrease in contract and grant revenue in as compared to was a result of the completion of certain contracts and grants 
no new contracts or grants were entered into during to replace those that were completed 
the future the recognition of revenue under contracts and grants may vary from quarter to quarter and may result in significant fluctuations in operating results from year to year depending on the timing and quantity of agreements and contracts 
in the future  we expect contract and grant revenue to become a decreasing portion of our overall revenues 
we expect the majority of our revenue growth to be generated through an increase in product revenue 
cost and expenses cost of product sales in thousands year ended december  year ended december  difference difference cost of product sales cost of product sales includes the material  manufacturing labor  overhead costs and inventory impairment charges inventory reserves related to our products 
in  the cost of product sales primarily included the cost of manufacturing real time pcr products both custom and proprietary tests along with the second generation molecular testing platforms nanochip systems and asr test suites 
in  all sales of our first generation system were excluded from our cost of sales due to the reserves we had taken in in and the cost of product sales primarily related to the first generation 
table of contents molecular testing systems and various asrs 
in addition  in and we incurred significant inventory reserve expenses of million and  respectively  that related to underutilized capacity  excess instrumentation inventory and obsolete components 
the increase in reserve expense in as compared to  related to purchase commitments from hitachi that lead to a large inventory build up of our first generation molecular testing systems 
the decrease in cost of product sales in as compared to related to a million inventory reserve expense in without this inventory reserve expense the cost of product sales would have increased in as compared to this increase related to incurring a full year of manufacturing cost for real time asrs that were acquired in our december epoch acquisition 
the increase in cost of product sales in as compared to related to the million inventory reserve incurred in as compared to a  inventory reserve incurred in without these inventory reserves the cost of product sales decreased in as compared to this was primarily caused by a lower number of first generation molecular testing system units and asr sold in as of december   and we had inventory reserves of million  million and million that primarily related to our first generation molecular testing system 
this inventory reserve was accumulated throughout and during our quarterly evaluations of anticipated sales for the next twelve months 
after our announcement of a second generation molecular testing system in october and evaluating actual sales during the year  we reserved expensed the net remaining carrying value of all first generation molecular testing systems without customer purchase orders as of december  in the year ended december   we sold approximately  of first generation molecular testing systems that had been fully reserved 
going forward  future sales of our first generation system are highly uncertain in light of our release of a second generation system in october of future sales of the first generation nanochip systems  if any  will have a minimal cost of product sales 
the future 
we are still in the early stages of the commercialization of our real time pcr products both custom and proprietary tests along with the second generation molecular testing system and asrs 
we are working to build in efficiencies into our manufacturing processes  however we anticipate the second generation molecular testing system will have a lower selling price per unit  therefore  our gross margins will depend on the number of units sold or rented to absorb our fixed capacity costs 
we expect to continue to incur significant costs associated with excess production capacity within our manufacturing facilities in as we work to build demand for our second generation molecular testing system and asrs 
research and development expenses in thousands year ended december  year ended december  difference difference research and development research and development expenses include the costs associated with the development of our technology 
in  through our on going acquisition and development strategy  we have broadened our research and development efforts from focusing solely on the molecular testing platforms  asrs and real time pcr products both custom and proprietary tests  highly specific point of care tests for identifying protein markers and advanced genetic markers that are prognosticators of diseases 
while these research and development efforts are focused on distinct technology platforms  the knowledge gained researching this technology provides us an advantage developing our suite of advanced medical diagnostic products across all our product lines 
the increase in research and development costs in as compared to related to incurring an additional million for a full year of research and development costs associated with our real time pcr products that we acquired in our epoch acquisition in december in addition  we incurred approximately million of research and development costs associated with the september investment and subsequent consolidation of jurilab ltd a variable interest entity 
the slight increase in 
table of contents research and development costs in as compared to was primarily due to cost reductions in related to the first generation molecular testing system that offset the additional million in costs associated with the development of point of care product lines 
the future 
as we are in the early stages of our product development life cycles  we expect our research and development expenditures to increase modestly from levels 
we expect to shift our focus from the development of our second generation molecular testing system to developing asrs to drive demand for the system 
in addition  we continue to focus on developing a broader product line of both custom and proprietary tests for our real time pcr product lines 
also  we will continue to focus on seeking regulatory approval and the commercialization of our point of care tests 
selling  general and administrative expenses in thousands year ended december  year ended december  difference difference selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses include sales and marketing personnel  tradeshows  promotional activities and materials  administrative personnel  legal  other professional expenses and general corporate expenses 
the upward trend in selling  general and administrative expenses each year was due to our acquisition strategy where we incurred the incremental costs of managing a broader portfolio of product lines 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as compared to primarily related to million in additional expenses due to incurring a full year of synx and epoch s selling and administrative costs 
in addition  we incurred an additional million for selling and marketing expenses as compared to that was primarily related to the release of our second generation molecular testing system and the anticipated release of several new products 
the increase in expenses in as compared to primarily relates to million in additional expenditures related to our acquisition of synx and the subsequent incremental operating expenses 
in addition  we incurred approximately  in expenses related to the costs of sarbanes oxley act compliance and a  non cash charge related to a modification to extend the exercise period from days to days for vested options relating to a separation agreement with our then president and chief operating officer 
the future 
we expect that our selling  general and administrative expenditures on a percentage basis will trend lower than the increases in our revenue 
on a consolidated basis  we expect to achieve significant synergies and savings by consolidating many of the general and administrative functions 
the savings from consolidation of general and administrative activities are expected to be offset by increased sales and marketing expenses required to support the various new product launches expected in expenses may also be further impacted by potential future business combinations or corporate development transactions 
charges for goodwill  acquired in process research and development impairment for acquired technology in thousands year ended december  year ended december  difference difference impairment charge on goodwill charge for acquired in process research and development impairment for acquired technology rights goodwill is created using the purchase method of accounting for acquisitions and it represents the difference between the acquisition price and the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets 
in  we recognized million and million in goodwill assets related to our 
table of contents purchases of epoch and synx  respectively 
under the first step of the sfas analysis we determined our reporting units 
we allocated our goodwill assets to our epoch and synx reporting units and performed our goodwill testing to determine if the reporting units carrying amount including goodwill was greater than its fair value 
to determine the estimated fair value of the reporting units we used a third party to perform a valuation analysis of our reporting units  while we reviewed their assumptions  calculations and conclusions for reasonableness and accuracy 
we determined that the carrying amount of the reporting unit that included epoch was in excess of its fair value 
therefore  we were required to proceed to the second step of the sfas analysis for the epoch reporting unit and use the methodology described in sfas no 
business combinations to determine the fair value of the reporting unit as if we purchased the reporting unit on october  the fair value was based on a combination of the income approach  which estimates the fair value based on the future discounted cash flows  and the market approach  which estimates the fair value based on comparable market prices 
under the income approach  we assumed a cash flow period through with terminal values thereafter  long term annual revenue growth rates of to  a discount rate of and terminal value growth rates of 
we determined that the fair value of the reporting unit related to epoch was approximately million 
therefore  we incurred a non cash impairment charge to our goodwill of million  which did not affect our liquidity 
the future 
annually  we assess potential impairments to goodwill when there is evidence that events or circumstances indicate that the recorded value of an asset the carrying amount may not be recovered 
these assessments are based on estimates of the materiality of various on going events and circumstances related to the goodwill asset 
indicators of impairment maybe the assets inability to meet prior revenue estimates  inconsistent operational performance  lack of future potential  or other factors 
as of december  we believe we have recorded the fair value of our goodwill on our balance sheet and do not expect any material future charges 
however  it is difficult to model all possible future events and if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record an impairment charge on all or a portion of our remaining goodwill 
we incurred a non cash charge of million related to the expensing of acquired in process research and development ipr d  related to the synx acquisition in the ipr d asset was expensed at the date of acquisition in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
applicability of fasb statement no 
to business combinations accounted for by the purchase method 
the estimated fair value of million in ipr d expense was related to million for congestive heart failure chf   for traumatic brain injury tbi and  for diabetes diagnostic products 
these products as of the acquisition date in april  had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses 
the future 
the development of these diagnostic products is subject to a number of risks  including development  regulatory and marketing risks 
as of december  none of these products has been commercialized  however  our chf product is closest to commercialization 
we do not currently have a schedule for the commercialization of the tbi or diabetes diagnostic products 
the primary risk associated with not completing this technology  as anticipated  is the delay in recovery or non recovery of our investment in this area of research and development 
we do not expect to incur any additional charges for acquired ipr d related to the synx or epoch acquisitions 
however  if we acquire other companies in the future  we may incur additional material ipr d expenses 
additional costs associated with the completion of ipr d projects are recorded as research and development expenses in the period incurred 
the impairment of acquired technology rights relates to the difference of our license agreements assets carrying values and their estimated fair values 
in  we recognized  of impairment charges related to our inability to utilize certain in licensed technology rights 
in  we decided to restructure certain license agreements and it resulted in a million impairment expense 

table of contents the future 
as of december   we have approximately million in net book value remaining associated with acquired technology rights related to in licensing of various technologies 
we regularly review these assets for impairment and it is possible that additional impairment charges may be necessary in future periods 
other income the following table summarizes our other income for the years ended december   and in thousands year ended december  year ended december  difference difference interest income  net other expense warrant valuation adjustment gain loss on sale of investments gain loss on foreign currency translation minority interest in loss of consolidated subsidiary total other income interest income  net interest income relates to the interest we receive on our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments 
our interest income trended upwards as a result of higher interest rate yields on our investment balances 
warrant valuation adjustment as a result of our december acquisition of epoch  we assumed warrants for  shares of our common stock 
the warrants have an exercise price of per share and expire in early if there is a change of control of nanogen  under certain circumstances the warrants have a provision that allows them to be redeemed for cash based on the black sholes formula 
however  the volatility variable in the black sholes formula is limited to the lesser of or our actual historical volatility 
using the methodology prescribed in eitf  accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in a company s own stock  we recorded a current liability for the fair value of the cash redemption portion of the warrants 
the liability was measured and recorded in accordance with the terms of the warrant agreements 
the valuation of the warrants and the corresponding liability are re measured quarterly until the warrants are exercised or expire 
the assumptions used in the black scholes pricing model were december  december  expected term years years interest rate volatility dividends calculated cash redemption value of the warrants the decrease in the market price of our common stock and other changes in the black scholes formula s variables from december  to december  resulted in a million decrease 
table of contents in the value of the warrants 
therefore  we reported million as a warrant valuation adjustment in our statement of operations for the year ended december  gain loss on the sale of investments the gain loss on the sale of investments in related to sales of our short term investments for operating capital 
in  we realized a loss on the sale of short term investments of million when we sold  shares of combimatrix stock that we obtained through a legal settlement agreement 
gain on foreign currency translation in accordance with sfas no 
 foreign currency translation we recognized a one time gain of million of previously unrealized foreign currency translation gains in this related to our decision to discontinue all material business activities of nanogen recognomics gmbh 
minority interest in loss of consolidated subsidiary minority interest in loss of consolidated subsidiary related to our majority owned subsidiary  nanogen recognomics gmbh that was funded by a million investment from a minority interest investor 
through  we accounted for the minority interest in the subsidiary s expenditures in the cost and expenses section of the income statement 
to record the offset against the minority interest recorded in our balance sheet we recorded a gain in the other income section in the income statement 
the net effect of these entries was to reflect actual expenditures in the cost and expense section of our income statement while recognizing the contribution of the minority investor as a gain in the other income section of the income statement 
therefore  the effect on our net loss was eliminated 
in  the final minority interest investor s funds were expended 
liquidity and capital resources short term and long term liquidity the following is a summary of our key liquidity measures as of december   and in thousands december  december  december  cash and cash equivalents short term investments  available for sale total cash and cash equivalents and short term investment  available for sale current assets current liabilities working capital our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  available for sale and working capital decreased million and million  respectively  at december  as compared to december  these decreases were due to the early stages of our products life cycle that requires us to expend cash as we bring our products to market and expand our product pipeline through acquisitions and product development 
we believe we will continue to consume cash and have quarterly net losses during the next several years 
we have incurred negative cash flows from operations since inception and do not expect to generate positive cash flows to fund our operations until we generate significant revenues from our product offerings and or begin generating a return on our intellectual property 

table of contents in june  we filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission that allowed us to raise up to million in equity transactions 
in september  to continue to fund our commercialization strategy  we received approximately million in cash by issuing to institutional investors a combination of million shares of common stock at per share and a million warrants exercisable at per share for five years 
we were subject to certain restrictions under the placement agency agreement in our september offering  which limited our ability to sell additional equity until december  unless it was in connection with merger and acquisition activity 
after january  we may raise an additional million by selling some combination of common stock  preferred stock  debt securities or warrants 
in march  we received approximately million in cash by issuing to an investor  shares of common stock at per share 
as a result of this transaction we now have available million under our shelf registration statement 
from inception to december   we have financed our operations primarily by issuing our stock generating revenues obtained cash through our acquisition of epoch using proceeds from our litigation settlement with combimatrix obtaining a modest amount of capital equipment long term financing we believe that our near term borrowing requirements and related debt repayments will continue to involve a relatively small amount of cash 
we invest excess funds in short term investments that are classified as available for sale 
we believe that it is important to maintain a significant amount of cash and short term investments on hand to ensure that we have adequate resources to fund future research and development  provide working capital and assuage legal risks and challenges to our business model 
cash provided by used in operating  investing and financing activities of the years ended december   and is as follows in thousands december  december  december  net cash used in operating activities net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities operating activities net cash used in operating activities for the years ended december   and primarily related to our net losses and changes in working capital due to the product shipments and payments of liabilities 
the net cash used was primarily related to the costs associated with commercializing our products including the expansion  development and support of our sales and marketing organization  the procurement of inventory pursuant to our manufacturing arrangement with hitachi  ltd  support of our continuing research and development efforts  and legal fees relating to establishing  maintaining and defending our intellectual property portfolio 
in addition  in the year ended december  our net loss increased by million that related to a reduction of the fair value of a goodwill asset 
however  because this was a non cash event it did not affect the cash used in operations  therefore we added back the million to our operating activities 
the increasing amount of cash used in operations each year related to our acquisition activities and the resulting increase in operating costs that were not offset by increased revenues 

table of contents investing activities net cash provided by investing activities in and related to net proceeds from the sale of short term investments  which was offset by the purchase of fewer short term investments ie we utilized short term investments to fund our operating and financing activities 
net cash used in investing activities in related to reinvesting the cash we realized from our common stock sales into purchasing available for sale short term investments 
in  we had approximately million in payments related to our december acquisition of epoch 
in addition  we paid approximately million of payments  net of cash consolidated related to our strategic investments in to jurilab  fastraq and pgx 
in  we issued million shares of common stock for the acquisition of synx and epoch and received million in cash  net of acquisition expenses 
capital spending is essential to our product innovation initiatives and maintaining our operational capabilities 
therefore  in  and we used cash to purchase million   and million in property and equipment to support the development of our product lines 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities in related to the million gross cash proceeds or million net of expenses by issuing to institutional investors a combination of approximately million shares of common stock and a million warrants exercisable at per share for five years

in and we received  and  respectively  under this agreement 
net cash provided by financing activities was offset by payments related to our debt obligations of million   and  in  and  respectively  and the acquisition of treasury stock in we have no significant contractual obligations not fully recorded on our consolidated balance sheets or fully disclosed in the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements

the liabilities recognized as a result of consolidating the vie do not represent additional claims on our general assets  rather  they represent claims against the specific assets of the consolidated vie 
therefore  we have only included debt obligations that represent claims on our general assets 
b in july  we executed a ten year agreement with hitachi to develop  manufacture and distribute potential products based on the parties proprietary technologies 
at a minimum  we were required to match the hitachi contribution to our research and development on an annual basis over a ten year period 
in addition  we are required to repay of hitachi s contributions to research and development with no interest over an indefinite period of time 
from the inception of the collaboration agreement with hitachi through the termination of the agreement in august  we received a total of million in sponsored research funding 
half of this funding was recorded as revenue and the remaining half is recorded as a long term liability 
we recognized the last  in revenue from hitachi in and do not expect any revenue from this agreement in the future 
at december  we owe approximately million to hitachi and the repayment amount is determined as of our gross molecular testing system cartridge sales 
c our manufacturing agreement with hitachi  ltd 
hitachi requires that we provide annual purchase commitments to hitachi for our next generation nanochip workstations  the nanochip as of december   we had commitments to purchase approximately  of nanochip workstations through april  future purchase commitments will be determined based on product demand and inventory levels 
d payments are not required under the standby letters of credit and expire at various dates and therefore the table above does not reflect payment information over the five year period 
e we may increase our equity investment in jurilab by approximately million in f we entered in to material development agreements with fastraq a related party transaction and pgx that commits us to  and  respectively  in funding with these entities reach certain contractually defined research and development milestones 
g on december   we entered into an asset purchase agreement with spectral diagnostics inc where we will acquire the assets related to its rapid cardiac immunoassay test business during the first quarter of in addition  we are required to use our best efforts to register the shares issued in this transaction with the securities and exchange commission within two weeks of the transaction 
we did not register these shares by this date and there is a cash settlement provision in the asset purchase agreement related to the difference between the closing price of a share and the future closing price of the shares when they are 
table of contents registered 
if the share price has fallen more than from the february  closing price or a share on the date of registration we maybe required to pay spectral in cash for the difference 
the maximum liability is  in canadian dollars 
conversely  if our share price increases more than above the closing price or under certain circumstances spectral maybe required to refund us cash for the difference between the closing price and the increase in price 
the maximum refund is  canadian dollars 
we have included the maximum liability in this outstanding contractual obligations table 
we are a party to development site agreements with various entities where we may be obligated to pay license fees or royalties for any customer owned or licensed intellectual property used to develop any of our commercial products 
none of these agreements individually are considered material 
future accounting requirements in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  that addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for either equity instruments of the enterprise or liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
the statement eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions  as we do currently  using the intrinsic value method as prescribed by accounting principles board  or apb  opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and generally requires that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method and recognized as expenses in our consolidated statement of income 
the statement requires companies to assess the most appropriate model to calculate the value of the options 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to value options and are currently assessing which model we may use in the future under the new statement and may deem an alternative model to be the most appropriate 
the use of a different model to value options may result in a different fair value than the use of the black scholes option pricing model 
in addition  there are a number of other requirements under the new standard that would result in differing accounting treatment than currently required 
these differences include  but are not limited to  the accounting for the tax benefit on employee stock options and for stock issued under our employee stock purchase plan  and the presentation of these tax benefits within the consolidated statement of cash flows 
in addition to the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  we will also be required to determine the transition method to be used at date of adoption 
the allowed transition methods include modified prospective and modified retroactive adoption options 
the modified prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of fas no 
r  while the retroactive method would record compensation expense for all unvested stock options and restricted stock beginning with the first period restated 
in april  the securities and exchange commission announced the adoption of release no 
 amendment to rule a of regulation s x regarding the compliance date for statement of financial standard no 
revised  share based payment  that amends the effective date of fas no 
r 
the effective date of the new standard under these new rules for our consolidated financial statements is january  adoption of this statement will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements as we will be required to expense the fair value of our stock option grants and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan rather than disclose the impact on our consolidated net income within our footnotes  as is our current practice 
net operating loss carryforwards as of december   we had federal  state and foreign net operating loss  or nol  carryforwards of approximately million  million and million  respectively  and million and million of research and development  tax credits available to offset future federal and state income taxes  respectively 
the federal and state nol carryforwards are subject to alternative minimum tax limitations and to examination by the tax authorities 
the federal tax loss carryforwards will continue expiring in  unless utilized  and the 
table of contents state tax loss carryforwards will continue expiring in  unless utilized 
the federal and state r d tax credit carryforwards will begin expiring in unless utilized 
our initial public offering combined with the concurrent private placement  which occurred in april  may be perceived as a change of ownership under federal income tax regulations 
we also experienced a change of ownership in and in  we acquired synx s and epoch s nols 
pursuant to sections and of the internal revenue code  annual use of the our net operating losses and credit carryforwards may be limited due to cumulative changes in ownership of more than over a year period 
we may be subject to similar limitations on its canadian losses acquired from synx 
we have not performed a formal analysis to quantify the amount of possible limitations 
currently the net operating losses reflected above have not been reduced by potential limitations  however  a full valuation allowance has been placed on all deferred tax assets and  therefore  there is no material impact on our financial statements 
similar limitations may also apply to utilization of r d tax credits to offset taxes payable 
however  we do not believe such limitations may have a material impact on our ability to utilize the nols

the effects of translation are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated financial statements 
in certain instances  our subsidiaries conduct business with customers and vendors in euros or in other local european currencies 
exchange gains and losses arising from these transactions are recorded using the actual exchange rate differences between the date of the transaction and the date of settlement 
we have not taken any action to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  such as options or futures contracts  with respect to transactions with our european customers and vendors
