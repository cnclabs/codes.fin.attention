item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity risk management contained in the corporation s annual report on form k for the year ended december  finally  hibernia has experienced a significant increase in deposits since the gulf coast hurricanes  most likely as a result of customers receiving federal funds and insurance payments relating to the hurricanes 
currently  it is unclear what customers will do with these deposits on a long term scale 
it is possible that as rebuilding and reinvesting in the gulf coast area begins  the amount of these incremental deposits with hibernia could decrease significantly 
we may experience changes in our debt ratings in general  ratings agencies play an important role in determining  by means of the ratings they assign to issuers and their debt  the availability and cost of wholesale funding 
we currently receive ratings from several ratings entities for our secured and unsecured borrowings 
as private entities  ratings agencies have broad discretion in the assignment of ratings 
a rating below investment grade typically reduces availability and increases the cost of market based funding  both secured and unsecured 
a debt rating of baa or higher by moody s investors service  or bbb or higher by standard poor s and fitch ratings  is considered investment grade 
currently  all three ratings agencies rate the unsecured senior debt of the bank  hibernia and the corporation as investment grade 
the following chart shows ratings for capital one financial corporation  capital one bank and hibernia national bank as of december  as of that date  the ratings outlooks were as follows standard poor s moody s fitch capital one financial corporation bbb baa bbb capital one financial corporation outlook positive stable positive capital one bank bbb a bbb capital one bank outlook positive stable positive hibernia national bank bbb a bbb hibernia national bank outlook positive stable positive because we depend on the capital markets for funding and capital  we could experience reduced availability and increased cost of funding if our debt ratings were lowered 
this result could make it difficult for us to grow at or to a level we currently anticipate 
the immediate impact of a ratings downgrade on other sources of funding  however  would be limited  as our deposit funding and pricing  as well as some of our unsecured corporate borrowing  is not generally determined by corporate debt ratings 
we face market risk of interest rate and exchange rate fluctuations like other financial institutions  we borrow money from institutions and depositors  which we then lend to customers 
we earn interest on the consumer loans we make  and pay interest on the deposits and borrowings we 
table of contents use to fund those loans 
changes in these two interest rates affect the value of our assets and liabilities 
if the rate of interest we pay on our borrowings increases more than the rate of interest we earn on our loans  our net interest income  and therefore our earnings  would fall 
our earnings could also be hurt if the rates on our consumer loans fall more quickly than those on our borrowings 
we also seek to minimize market risk to a level that is immaterial to our net income 
the financial instruments and techniques we use to manage the risk of interest rate and exchange rate fluctuations  such as asset liability matching and interest rate and exchange rate swaps and hedges and some forward exchange contracts  may not always work successfully or may not be available at a reasonable cost 
furthermore  if these techniques become unavailable or impractical  our earnings could be subject to volatility and decreases as interest rates and exchange rates change 
changes in interest rates also affect the balances our customers carry on their credit cards and affect the rate of pre payment for installment loan products 
when interest rates fall  there may be more low rate product alternatives available to our customers 
consequently  their credit card balances may fall and pre payment rates for installment loan products may rise 
we can mitigate this risk by reducing the interest rates we charge or by refinancing installment loan products 
however  these changes can reduce the overall yield on our portfolio if we do not adequately provide for them in our interest rate hedging strategies 
when interest rates rise  there are fewer low rate alternatives available to customers 
consequently  credit card balances may rise or fall more slowly and pre payment rates on installment lending products may fall 
in this circumstance  we may have to raise additional funds at higher interest rates 
in our credit card business  we could  subject to legal and competitive constraints  mitigate this risk by increasing the interest rates we charge  although such changes may increase opportunities for our competitors to offer attractive products to our customers and consequently increase customer attrition from our portfolio 
we could also mitigate this risk through hedging strategies  if available  if we are unable to do so  we could suffer adverse impacts on overall portfolio yield 
rising interest rates across the industry may also lead to higher delinquencies as customers face increasing interest payments both on our products and on other loans they may hold 
see pages in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations interest rate risk management contained in the annual report on form k for the year ended december  we face the risk of a complex and changing regulatory and legal environment we operate in a heavily regulated industry and are therefore subject to a wide array of banking  consumer lending and deposit laws and regulations that apply to almost every element of our business 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in financial  structural and operational penalties  including receivership 
in addition  efforts to comply with these laws and regulations may increase our costs and or limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities 
see supervision and regulation above 
federal and state laws and regulations  as well as laws and regulations to which we are subject in foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business  significantly limit the types of activities in which we may engage 
for example  federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations  and laws and regulations of foreign jurisdictions where we conduct business  limit the manner in which we may offer and extend credit 
from time to time  the us congress  the states and foreign governments consider changing these laws and may enact new laws or amend existing laws and regulatory authorities may issue new regulations 
such new laws or regulations could limit the amount of interest or fees we can charge  restrict our ability to collect on account balances  or materially affect us or the banking or credit card industries in some other manner 
additional federal  state and foreign consumer protection legislation also could seek to expand the privacy protections afforded to customers of financial institutions and restrict our ability to share or receive customer information 
in addition  banking regulators possess broad discretion to issue or revise regulations  or to issue guidance  which may significantly impact us 
for example  the federal trade commission has issued  and will continue to issue  a variety of regulations under the fact act of  the federal reserve has announced proposed rule making  and has issued some final rules  and in the uk the office of fair trading is conducting an industry investigation on the calculation of default charges  all of which may impact us 
additionally  the new bankruptcy reform legislation will put additional requirements on the company regarding disclosures on the effects on consumers of making only minimum payments on their accounts 
we cannot  however  predict whether and how any new 
table of contents guidelines issued or other regulatory actions taken by the banking or other regulators will be applied to the bank  the national bank or the savings bank  in what manner such regulations might be applied  or the resulting effect on us  the bank  the national bank or the savings bank 
there can be no assurance that this kind of regulatory action will not have a negative impact on us and or our financial results 
the credit card industry faces increased litigation risks relating to industry structure we face possible risks from the outcomes of certain credit card industry litigation 
in  the united states department of justice filed an antitrust lawsuit against the mastercard and visa membership associations composed of financial institutions that issue mastercard or visa credit or debit cards associations  alleging  among other things  that the associations had violated antitrust law and engaged in unfair practices by not allowing member banks to issue cards from competing brands  such as american express and discover financial services 
in  a new york district court entered judgment in favor of the department of justice and ordered the associations to repeal these policies 
the united states court of appeals for the second circuit affirmed the district court and  on october   the united states supreme court denied certiorari in the case 
in november  american express filed an antitrust lawsuit the amex lawsuit against the associations and several member banks alleging that the associations and member banks jointly and severally implemented and enforced illegal exclusionary agreements that prevented member banks from issuing american express and discover cards 
the complaint requests civil monetary damages  which could be trebled 
the corporation  the bank  and the savings bank are named defendants in this lawsuit 
separately  a number of entities  each purporting to represent a class of retail merchants  have also filed antitrust lawsuits the interchange lawsuits against the associations and several member banks  including the corporation and its subsidiaries  alleging among other things  that the associations and member banks conspired to fix the level of interchange fees 
the complaints request civil monetary damages  which could be trebled 
in october  the interchange lawsuits were consolidated before the united states district court for the eastern district of new york 
we believe that we have meritorious defenses with respect to these cases and intend to defend these cases vigorously 
at the present time  management is not in a position to determine whether the resolution of these cases will have a material adverse effect on either the consolidated financial position of the corporation or the corporation s results of operations in any future reporting period 
in addition  several merchants filed class action antitrust lawsuits  which were subsequently consolidated  against the associations relating to certain debit card products 
in april  the associations agreed to settle the lawsuit in exchange for payments to plaintiffs and for changes in policies and interchange rates for debit cards 
certain merchant plaintiffs have opted out of the settlements and have commenced separate lawsuits 
additionally  consumer class action lawsuits with claims mirroring the merchants allegations have been filed in several courts 
finally  the associations  as well as certain member banks  continue to face additional lawsuits regarding policies  practices  products and fees 
with the exception of the interchange lawsuits and the amex lawsuit  the corporation and its subsidiaries are not parties to the lawsuits against the associations described above and therefore will not be directly liable for any amount related to any possible or known settlements of such lawsuits 
however  the corporation s subsidiary banks are member banks of mastercard and visa and thus may be affected by settlements or lawsuits relating to these issues  including changes in interchange payments 
in addition  it is possible that the scope of these lawsuits may expand and that other member banks  including the corporation s subsidiary banks  may be brought into the lawsuits or future lawsuits 
the associations are also subject to additional litigation  including suits regarding foreign exchange fees 
as a result of such litigation  the associations are expected to continue to evolve as corporate entities  including by changing their governance structures  as previously announced by the associations 
given the complexity of the issues raised by these lawsuits and the uncertainty regarding i the outcome of these suits  ii the likelihood and amount of any possible judgments  iii the likelihood  amount and validity of 
table of contents any claim against the associations member banks  including the banks and the corporation  and iv changes in industry structure that may result from the suits and v the effects of these suits  in turn  on competition in the industry  member banks  and interchange and association fees  we cannot determine at this time the long term effects of these suits on us 
we face the risk of fluctuations in our expenses and other costs that may hurt our financial results our expenses and other costs  such as operating and marketing expenses  directly affect our earnings results 
in light of the extremely competitive environment in which we operate  and because the size and scale of many of our competitors provides them with increased operational efficiencies  it is important that we are able to successfully manage such expenses 
many factors can influence the amount of our expenses  as well as how quickly they may increase 
for example  further increases in postal rates or termination of our negotiated service arrangement with the united states postal service could raise our costs for postal service 
as our business develops  changes or expands  additional expenses can arise from management of outsourced services  asset purchases  structural reorganization  a reevaluation of business strategies and or expenses to comply with new or changing laws or regulations 
other factors that can affect the amount of our expenses include legal and administrative cases and proceedings  which can be expensive to pursue or defend 
we face risks related to the impact of the gulf coast hurricanes that may be substantial and cannot be predicted hibernia is headquartered in new orleans  louisiana  and maintains branches in the areas of louisiana and texas that sustained significant damage from the gulf coast hurricanes 
hibernia s operations in other parts of louisiana and texas have not been impacted  either significantly or at all  by the hurricanes 
as a result of the hurricanes  hibernia is experiencing increased costs  including the costs of rebuilding or repairing branches and other properties as well as repairing or replacing equipment  some of which are not covered by insurance 
hibernia has also announced substantial employee and recovery related costs 
the gulf coast hurricanes have also affected hibernia s consumer  mortgage  auto  commercial and small business loan portfolios by damaging properties pledged as collateral and by impairing certain borrowers ability to repay their loans 
in addition  hibernia may experience losses from certain customer assistance policies  such as fee waivers  adopted in the wake of the hurricanes 
the hurricanes may continue to affect hibernia s loan originations and loan portfolio quality into the future and could also adversely impact hibernia s deposit base 
more generally  the combined company s ability to compete effectively in the branch banking business in the future  especially with financial institutions whose operations were not concentrated in the affected area or which may have greater resources than the combined company  will depend primarily on hibernia s ability to continue normal business operations and experience growth despite the impact of the hurricanes 
the severity and duration of these effects will depend on a variety of factors that are beyond hibernia s control  including the amount and timing of government  private and philanthropic investment including deposits in the region  the pace of rebuilding and economic recovery in the region generally  the extent to which the hurricanes property damage is covered by insurance  and the pace at which hibernia restores its business operations in the various markets in which it operates 
none of the effects described above can be accurately predicted or quantified 
as a result  significant uncertainty remains regarding the impact the hurricanes will have on the business  financial condition and results of operations of the combined company and the ability of the combined company to realize the anticipated benefits from the merger 
further  the area in which hibernia operates may experience hurricanes and other storms in the future  and some of those hurricanes and storms may have effects similar to those caused by the gulf coast hurricanes
