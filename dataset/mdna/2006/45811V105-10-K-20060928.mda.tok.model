certain statements set forth under this caption constitute forward looking statements 
see disclosure regarding forward looking statements on page of this report for additional factors relating to such statements 
effective july   the company no longer qualified as a small business registrant as the result of its revenues exceeding million for the prior two fiscal years 
accordingly  effective july   the company began to comply with the reporting requirements of regulation s k instead of regulation s b 
during the fiscal year ended june   the company changed its reporting segments to nutraceuticals  pharmaceuticals and biotechnologies from nutraceutical  pharmaceutical and technical services 
the company currently manages its business in these segments 
the prior year reported data as been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation 
the company is engaged primarily in the manufacturing  distributing  marketing and sales of vitamins  nutritional supplements and herbal products  the manufacture and distribution of paclitaxel  which is the primary chemotherapeutic agent in the treatment of breast cancer  technical services through its contract research organization  and the biotechnology business  which uses its patented plant based technology to produce vaccines and therapeutic antibodies 
the company s customers are located primarily throughout the united states 
for the fiscal years ended june   our pharmaceuticals segment incurred net losses of approximately million  and million  which included impairment charges of million  in the fiscal year ended june  on july   we announced a reduction in the rate of production of paclitaxel  an approved pharmaceutical ingredient api and a corresponding reduction in the company s workforce 
we continue to monitor the ongoing costs of operating the paxis facility 
in the fiscal year ended june   we hired a director of marketing for our pharmaceuticals segment whose main objective is to market our research and manufacturing capabilities and to work with our staff in implementing a strategic sales and marketing plan 
we continue to see an increase in our proposal activity and an expansion in our potential customer base in our pharmaceutical segment since implementing this strategic sales and marketing plan 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year ended june   our paxis subsidiary entered into a supply agreement with a european generics manufacturing company with extensive sales  marketing  and distribution channels in the european community  eastern europe  the united kingdom and the united states 
the agreement provides for minimum purchases during the first year of at least million of paxis api product 
paxis made its first shipment under the supply agreement in august the company can give no assurance that paxis can be operated profitably 
critical accounting policies and estimates estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the most significant estimates include o sales returns and allowances  o allowance for doubtful accounts  o inventory valuation  o valuation and recoverability of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill  including the values assigned to acquired intangible assets  o income taxes and valuation allowances on deferred income taxes  and o accruals for  and the probability of  the outcome of current litigation 
on a continual basis  management reviews its estimates utilizing currently available information  changes in facts and circumstances  historical experience and reasonable assumptions 
after such reviews  and if deemed appropriate  those estimates are adjusted accordingly 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns the company makes judgments as to its ability to collect outstanding receivables and provides allowances for the portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful 
provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding amounts 
we continuously monitor payments from our customers and maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses in the period they become known 
the company s return policy is to only accept returns for defective products 
if defective products are returned  it is the company s agreement with its customers that the company cure the defect and reship the product 
the policy is that when the product is shipped we make an estimate of any potential returns or allowances 
if the historical data we use to calculate the allowance provided for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables  additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and the future results of operations could be materially affected 
in recording any additional allowances  a respective charge against income is reflected in the general and administrative expenses  and would reduce the operating results in the period in which the increase is recorded 
the company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact of fluctuations in our estimates for our allowance for doubtful accounts 
as of june   the allowance for doubtful accounts was  if this amount were in error by plus or minus one percent of the account receivable balance  the impact would be an additional  of income or expense 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market lcm  which reflects management s estimates of net realizable value 
the inventory amounts are composed primarily of inventory items in both the nutraceutical and pharmaceutical segments of business 
as a result of our nutraceutical inventory being manufactured primarily on a purchase order basis  the quantity of both raw materials and finished goods inventory provides for minimal risk for potential overstock or obsolescence 
our pharmaceutical inventory is valued at market values  which is lower than our cost basis 
mail order inventory is expiration date sensitive 
the company reviews this inventory and considers sales levels by sku  term to expiration date  potential for retesting to extend expiration date and evaluates potential for obsolescence or overstock 
the company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact of fluctuations in our estimates for inventory allowances 
if our estimates used to value inventory were off by one percent of the total inventory balance  the impact would be an additional  of income or expense 
long lived assets purchased intangibles consisting of patents and unpatented technological expertise  intellectual property  license fees and trade names purchased as part of business acquisitions are presented net of related accumulated amortization and are being amortized on a straight line basis over the remaining useful lives 
the company records impairment losses on other intangible assets when events and circumstances indicate that such assets might be impaired and the estimated fair value of the asset is less than its recorded amount in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the company reviews the value of its long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate 
conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include material adverse changes in operations  significant adverse differences in actual results in comparison with initial valuation forecasts prepared at the time of acquisition  a decision to abandon certain acquired products  services  or marketplaces  or other significant adverse changes that would indicate the carrying amount of the recorded asset might not be recoverable 
goodwill and other intangible assets the financial accounting standards board fasb has issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives no longer be amortized against earnings  but instead tested for impairment at least annually based on a fair value approach as described in sfas intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
the useful life of an intangible asset is the period over which the asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to future cash flows 
the carrying value of intangible assets with finite lives is evaluated whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the carrying value is not recoverable when the projected undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value 
tests for impairment or recoverability require significant management judgment  and future events affecting cash flows and market conditions could result in impairment losses 
deferred taxes the company accounts for income taxes pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
sfas is an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences and events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or tax returns 
in the fiscal year ended june   the company recognized an income tax benefit  net of approximately million 
the income tax benefit was primarily the result of the change in the company s valuation reserve of million on its deferred tax assets 
in the fourth quarter ended june   the company  based on current factors relating to its business environment  including among other factors  the company securing a supply agreement and increasing its marketing activities in its contract services business in its pharmaceutical segment and the continued expansion and proven success in its branded propriety nutraceutical product line  the company had reasonable belief that it will have future federal taxable income which will allow the company to realize its deferred tax assets in the near future and consequently  it released the portion of its valuation allowance relating to those assets 
general litigation from time to time  the company is a defendant or plaintiff in various legal actions which arise in the normal course of business 
as such the company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of the provision required for these commitments and contingencies  if any  which would be charged to earnings  is made after careful analysis of each matter 
the provision may change in the future due to new developments or changes in circumstances 
changes in the provision could increase or decrease the company s earnings in the period the changes are made 
in the opinion of management  after consultation with legal counsel  the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
general the company recognizes revenue in accordance with the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin the company recognizes product sales revenue  the prices of which are fixed and determinable  when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer  when estimated provisions for product returns  rebates  charge backs and other sales allowances are reasonably determinable  and when collectibility is reasonably assured 
accruals for these items are presented in the consolidated financial statements as reductions to sales 
the company s net sales represent gross sales invoiced to customers  less certain related charges for discounts  returns  rebates  charge backs and other allowances 
cost of sales includes the cost of raw materials and all labor and overhead associated with the manufacturing and packaging of the products 
gross margins are affected by  among other things  changes in the relative sales mix among the company s products  as well as gross margins of acquired entities 
operating results in all periods presented reflect the impact of acquisitions 
the timing of those acquisitions and the changing mix of businesses as acquired companies are integrated into the company may affect the comparability of results from one period to another

the company can redeem a current liquidiation value of  or cause a conversion of all or a portion of the series b shares 
the company is permitted to use its million credit facility to redeem the series b preferred shares if it so elects 
the company s ability to fund these requirements will depend on its future operations  performance and cash flow and is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial business and other factors  some of which are beyond the company s control 
in addition  as part of the company s strategy  it may pursue acquisitions and investments that are complementary to its business 
any material future acquisitions or investments will likely require additional capital and therefore  the company cannot predict or assure that additional funds from existing sources will be sufficient for such future events
