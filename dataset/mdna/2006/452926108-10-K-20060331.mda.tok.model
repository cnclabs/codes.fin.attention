overview iori invests in equity interests in real estate through acquisitions  leases  partnerships and in mortgage loans 
iori is the successor to a california business trust organized on december   which commenced operations on april  critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap  requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies  including making estimates and assumptions 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different  it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements 
from time to time  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results  adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information 
below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
real estate held for investment real estate held for investment is carried at cost 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 
 requires that a property be considered impaired if the sum of the expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the property 
if impairment exists  an impairment loss is recognized  by a charge against earnings  equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the property exceeds the fair value less cost to sell the property 
if impairment of a property is recognized  the carrying amount of the property is reduced by the amount of the impairment  and a new cost for the property is established 
such new cost is depreciated over the property s remaining useful life 
depreciation is provided by the straight line method over estimated useful lives  which range from five to years 
real estate held for sale foreclosed real estate is initially recorded at new cost  defined as the lower of original cost or fair value minus estimated costs of sale 
sfas no 
also requires that properties held for sale be reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs of sale 
if a reduction in a held for sale property s carrying amount to fair value less costs of sale is required  a provision for loss is recognized by a charge against earnings 
subsequent revisions  either upward or downward  to a held for sale property s estimated fair value less costs of sale are recorded as an adjustment to the property s carrying amount  but not in excess of the property s carrying amount when originally classified as held for sale 
a corresponding charge against or credit to earnings is recognized 
properties held for sale are not depreciated 
investments in equity investees iori may be considered to have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and investment policies of certain of its investees 
those investees are accounted for using the equity method 
under 
table of contents 
index to financial statements the equity method  an initial investment  recorded at cost  is increased by a proportionate share of the investee s operating income and any additional investment and decreased by a proportionate share of the investee s operating losses and distributions received 
recognition of rental income rental income for commercial property leases is recognized on a straight line basis over the respective lease terms 
rental income for residential property leases is recorded when due from residents and is recognized monthly as earned  which is not materially different than on a straight line basis as lease terms are generally for periods of one year or less 
for hotel properties  revenues for room sales and guest services are recognized as rooms are occupied and services are rendered 
revenue recognition on the sale of real estate sales of real estate are recognized when and to the extent permitted by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for sales of real estate sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
until the requirements of sfas no 
for full profit recognition have been met  transactions are accounted for using the deposit  installment  cost recovery or financing method  whichever is appropriate 
when iori provides seller financing  gain is not recognized at the time of sale unless the buyer s initial investment and continuing investment are deemed to be adequate as determined by sfas guidelines 
non performing notes receivable iori considers a note receivable to be non performing when the maturity date has passed without principal repayment and the borrower is not making interest payments 
any new note receivable that results from a modification or extension of a note considered non performing will also be considered non performing  without regard to the borrower s adherence to payment terms 
interest recognition on notes receivable interest income is not recognized on notes receivable that have been delinquent for days or more 
in addition  accrued but unpaid interest income is only recognized to the extent that the net realizable value of the underlying collateral exceeds the carrying value of the receivable 
allowance for estimated losses a valuation allowance is provided for estimated losses on notes receivable considered to be impaired 
impairment is considered to exist when it is probable that all amounts due under the terms of the note will not be collected 
valuation allowances are provided for estimated losses on notes receivable to the extent that the investment in the note exceeds management s estimate of fair value of the collateral securing such note 
fair value of financial instruments the following assumptions were used in estimating the fair value of its notes receivable  marketable equity securities and notes payable 
for performing notes receivable  the fair value was estimated by discounting future cash flows using current interest rates for similar loans 
for non performing notes receivable  the estimated fair value of iori s interest in the collateral property was used 
for marketable equity securities  fair value was based on the year end closing market price of each security 
for notes payable  the fair value was estimated using current rates for mortgages with similar terms and maturities 
obligations and commitments iori has contractual obligations and commitments primarily with regarding the payment of mortgages

r  share based payment 
this statement addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions in which a company receives employee services in exchange for a equity instruments of the company  such as stock options  or b liabilities  such as those related to performance units  that are based on the fair value of the company s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
sfas no 
r  which is effective for the company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year  eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using apb opinion no 
 and generally requires that such transactions be accounted for using prescribed fair value based methods 
sfas no 
r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a a modified prospective method in which compensation costs are recognized beginning with the effective date based on the requirements of sfas no 
r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and based on the requirements of sfas no 
for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas no 
r that remain unvested on the effective date or b a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits companies to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas no 
for purposes of pro forma disclosures either for all periods presented or prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
the company has decided to adopt sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method 
sfas no 
r must be applied not only to new awards but to previously granted awards that are not fully vested on the effective date 
all of iori s options were fully vested as of the effective date  and iori has no outstanding options that were granted  modified  or settled after the effective date  so additional compensation costs for previously granted awards will not be recognized 
in december  the company s board of directors cancelled the stock option plan  and at the present time  the company has no plans to offer additional stock options 
the company does not believe the adoption of sfas no

 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements  changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
the statement requires retrospective application of changes in accounting principle to prior periods financial statements unless it is impracticable to determine the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
statement no 
is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of statement no 
is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows of iori 
in june  the fasb ratified the consensus in eitf issue no 
 determining whether a general partner  or the general partners as a group  controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights issue  which provides guidance in determining whether a general partner controls a limited partnership 
issue states that the general partner in a limited partnership is presumed to control that limited partnership 
the presumption may be overcome if the limited partners have either the substantive ability to dissolve the limited partnership or otherwise remove the general partner without cause or substantive participating rights  which provide the limited partners with the ability to effectively participate in significant decisions that would be expected to be made in the ordinary course of the limited partnership s business and thereby preclude the general partner from exercising unilateral control over the partnership 
the adoption of issue by us for new or modified limited partnership arrangements is effective june  and for existing limited partnership arrangements effective january  we do not expect that we will be required to consolidate our current unconsolidated joint venture investments nor do we expect issue to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements

index to financial statements at its june meeting  the eitf reached a consensus regarding issue no 
issue  determining the amortization period for leasehold improvements 
issue is effective for periods beginning after june  the guidance requires that leasehold improvements acquired in a business combination or purchased subsequent to the inception of a lease be amortized over the lesser of the useful life of the assets or a term that includes renewals that are reasonably assured at the date of acquisition or purchase 
the adoption of issue did not have a material impact to our financial condition or results of operations 
inflation the effects of inflation on iori s operations are not quantifiable 
revenues from property operations tend to fluctuate proportionately with inflationary increases and decreases in housing costs 
fluctuations in the rate of inflation also affect the sales values of properties and the ultimate gain to be realized from property sales 
to the extent that inflation affects interest rates  earnings from short term investments and the cost of new financings as well as the cost of variable interest rate debt will be affected 
taxes for the years and  iori elected and in the opinion of management qualified to be taxed as a reit as defined under sections through of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
to continue to qualify for federal taxation as a reit among other requirements  iori was required to hold at least of the value of its total assets in real estate assets  government securities  cash  and cash equivalents at the close of each quarter of each taxable year 
as a reit  iori was also required to distribute at least in of its reit taxable income plus in of its net income from foreclosure property on an annual basis to stockholders 
due to the completion of the tender offer by ari on march   and the resulting concentration of ownership  iori no longer met the requirement for tax treatment as a reit as of january  iori cannot re qualify for tax treatment as a reit for at least five years

index to financial statements item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures regarding market risk iori s future operations  cash flow and fair values of financial instruments are partially dependent upon the then existing market interest rates and market equity prices 
market risk is the change in the market rates and prices and the affect of these changes on future operations 
market risk is managed by matching the property s anticipated net operating income to an appropriate financing 
iori is exposed to interest rate risk associated with variable rate notes payable and maturing debt that has to be refinanced 
iori does not hold financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes  but rather issues these financial instruments to finance its portfolio of real estate assets 
iori s interest rate sensitivity position is managed by iori s finance department 
interest rate sensitivity is the relationship between changes in market interest rates and the fair value of market rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
iori s earnings are affected as changes in short term interest rates impact its cost of variable rate debt and maturing fixed rate debt 
a large portion of iori s market risk is exposure to short term interest rates from variable rate borrowings 
the impact on iori s financial statements of refinancing fixed debt that matured during was not material 
if market interest rates for variable rate debt average basis points more in than they did during  iori s interest expense would increase and income would decrease by  this amount is determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on iori s borrowing cost 
this analysis did not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
further  in the event of a change of such magnitude  management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure to the change 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  the sensitivity analysis assumes no change in iori s financial structure 
the following table contains only those exposures that existed at december  anticipation of exposures or risk on positions that could possibly arise was not considered 
iori s ultimate interest rate risk and its affect on operations will depend on future capital market exposures  which cannot be anticipated with a probable assurance level
