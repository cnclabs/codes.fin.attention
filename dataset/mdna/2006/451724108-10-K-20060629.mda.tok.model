industry trends industry analyst frost and sullivan in their recent world web conferencing market report separates the web conferencing vendor community into distinct groups that include service providers service providers and software providers software providers 
the difference between service providers and software providers is that the service providers effectively only offer web conferencing as an asp service or rental model basis 
however  software providers offer web conferencing as a solution that can be purchased and owned by customers whether the software is installed internally by customers or hosted by the software provider 
ilinc is one of the only providers that effectively competes in both the service provider and software provider markets 
while we also offer our ilinc suite as an asp or per minute service  the predominate licensing arrangement selected by our customer base remains the purchase model 
the web conferencing software market is the faster growing segment  representing about million of the current web conferencing market 
a frost and sullivan forecast projects a compound annual growth rate cagr between and as compared with the service provider market which is projected to grow at a cagr for the same time period 
the software provider market  based upon its higher growth rate  is expected to outgrow the service provider market by the end of another important trend in the industry is the convergence of communication technologies such as audio and web conferencing and the increase in demand for a single source for both of these capabilities 
frost and sullivan has noted  in a separate report on audio conferencing  that the demand for integrated audio  web  and video conferencing solutions continues to surge as end user needs for easy to use  single source solutions swell 
developing and providing a truly converged user environment and experience  including the integration of audio  web and video conferencing technologies  is essential 
with the addition of audio conferencing capabilities  we have been able to provide a single source for deeply integrated web  audio  video as well as voice over ip 
increasingly  the option a vendor chooses for web conferencing determines their selection for audio conferencing 
we believe we have already made significant progress in selling audio conferencing to the ilinc customer base and we actively cross sell all of our products and services to all customers 
we believe that another benefit of the integrated conferencing approach is customer retention 
according to the same frost and sullivan report  when web conferencing and audio conferencing are sold together as an integrated package there is a significant increase in retention of the audio conferencing service 
we are continuing to create incentives for our audio customers to be both web and audio customers to drive this retention 
market position differentiators we view our position in the market as the best solution for the enterprise wide buyer that has already adopted web conferencing  as well as organizations that believe their usage of web conferencing will grow quickly 
as mentioned earlier  a growing number of these organizations are using four or more different vendors for web or audio conferencing services and  therefore  not realizing the economies of scale that consolidating to one or two vendors for these services can provide 
there are also other important considerations revolving around web conferencing such as security and bandwidth availability that are forcing the buying decision for web and audio conferencing out of the business units and into the it department 
we believe that our solution uniquely maps to critical it requirements among these mature buyers in four important areas 
first  we offer web conferencing software with flexible licensing options that allows organizations to pay a one time license fee to install the software inside of their environment  or to purchase perpetual licenses and have those licenses hosted in our co location facility 
we find this flexibility to be an important differentiator to address the needs of customers that are ready to make an enterprise wide decision as well as customers that think their usage may grow throughout their organization 
we believe this licensing structure also enables us to maintain a consistent revenue stream of smaller sized purchases while also winning larger enterprise wide deals that help substantially increase revenue growth 
second  we believe we offer the highest level of data security commercially available 
we believe that we are the only web conferencing provider that offers a customer hosted solution with a purchase license option and true point to point security with our unique combination of advanced encryption standard and secure socket layer ssl 
all information within a session can be transmitted between meeting attendees securely without any reduction in performance 
we believe this aspect of our software has been extremely attractive to government  military  and financial organizations as well as to the companies that supply to these entities 
we also believe that this solution  combined with other aspects of our software  enables us to be a more reliable solution than our web conferencing software competitors 
third  our solution is suitable and scalable for enterprise wide deployment 
the ilinc suite contains four modes that address the most common needs for business collaboration within the enterprise 
we offer virtual classroom software with our learnlinc mode  presentation and sales demonstration capabilities with meetinglinc  customer support with supportlinc  and a mode for web casts and marketing events with conferencelinc 
each of these modes shares a common interface enabling users of one mode to easily understand any of our other modes 
we believe this reduces the learning curve for web conferencing enterprise wide roll out and we believe increases adoption success 
all users can have access to all four modes of the suite 
this is an important differentiation because our competition typically charges separate licensing fees for the use of separate modes 
giving users access to the full suite supports the natural migration of web conferencing usage from department to department 
each of the modes has functionality built specifically for a particular type of activity 
fourth  we provide what we believe to be an exceptional total cost of ownership value 
our software and services are competitively priced but  unlike our competitors  a customer s installation of our product is a very short and non labor intensive process 
maintenance of our software also requires minimal attention from an it perspective 
we believe most of our web conferencing software competitors require very complex and costly implementations 
we believe that all of these factors make our solution compelling to organizations that have already adopted the practice of web conferencing as a best practice as well as companies that are just starting to use web conferencing  but anticipate that their usage will grow quickly 
we recognize that in order to grow our market share we need to develop products that are easy to implement and that scale with our customer needs 
sales and marketing focus to leverage these advantages  our organization continually creates new marketing and sales campaigns that focus in four target markets 
o we sell to prospects that are using other web conferencing service providers that are ready to migrate to web conferencing software 
we find that these organizations appreciate the cost and feature advantages that our technology offers 
o we target organizations that have a natural fit for highly secure web conferencing software such as government  military  and financial organizations as well as the companies that supply to these entities 
o we target organizations looking to deploy live  web based training 
our software was originally built for training and we have maintained a competitive technology advantage in this area 
o we continue to cross sell all of our products and services to our large database of existing customers 
results of operations as of march   we provide integrated web and audio conferencing software and services with what we believe to be a very robust feature set that includes integrated video and voice over ip 
the ilinc suite includes learnlinc  which permits live instructor led training and education over the internet to remote students replicating the instructor led environment  meetinglinc  which facilitates more effective and economical communication through online meetings using voice over ip technology to avoid the expense of travel and long distance charges  conferencelinc  which delivers your message more consistently in a one to many format replicating professionally managed conferencing events  and supportlinc  which gives customer service organizations the ability to provide remote  hands on support for products  systems  or software applications 
the ilinc suite is available in both a periodic license rental model and perpetual license purchase model 
since its beginnings in  learnlinc and meetinglinc have been installed and operational in corporate  government  and educational organizations in the united states and internationally 
our ilinc suite of products includes the ability to use integrated voice over ip and two way live video 
we have also completely integrated audio conferencing services into the web conferencing products 
these services supplement the web product but can also be purchased separately 
the operations of the company involve many risks  which  even through a combination of experience  knowledge  and careful evaluation  may not be overcome 
these risks include the fact that the market for web conferencing products and services is in the early stages of development and may not grow to a sufficient size or at a sufficient rate to sustain the company s business 
the company also faces intense competition from other web conferencing and audio conferencing providers and may be unable to compete successfully 
many of the company s existing and potential competitors have longer operating histories and significantly greater financial  technical  and other resources and therefore may be able to more quickly respond to changing opportunities or customer requirements 
new competitors are also likely to enter this market in the future due to the lack of significant barrier to entry in the market share 
see additional risk factors that may affect our operating results and the market price of our common stock

critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the more significant areas requiring use of estimates relate to revenue recognition  accounts receivable and notes receivable valuation reserves  realizability of intangible assets  realizability of deferred income tax assets  and the evaluation of contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of such estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition our revenues are generally classified into three main categories license revenue  software and audio service revenue and maintenance and professional service revenue 
license revenue is generated from the sale of our ilinc suite of web conferencing software on a software purchase model basis and from the sale of our off the shelf courseware  primarily the online bridge mini mba program 
software and audio service revenue is generated from the sale of our ilinc suite of web conferencing software on an application service provider asp model basis  the sale of our ilinc suite software on a per minute basis  and includes all revenue from the provision of audio conferencing services  as well as  all service contracts that might include hosting and training services 
maintenance and professional service revenue is generated from the sale of maintenance contracts related to our ilinc suite of web conferencing software on a purchase model basis  when hosted by the customer  and from the sale of professional services that are associated with our custom content development services 
sales of software licenses because we offer the ilinc suite software in one of two forms  the first being a purchase model and the second being an asp or per minute model  we have separate revenue recognition policies applicable to each licensing model 
with each sale of our web conferencing products and services  we execute written contracts with our customers that govern the terms and conditions of each software license sale  hosting agreement  maintenance and support agreement  and other services arrangements 
we do not typically execute written agreements for the sale of audio conferencing services 
in connection with the company s sales of software licenses  whether on a purchase model basis or periodic license basis  the company adopted statement of position sop software revenue recognition as issued by the american institute of certified public accountants 
in accordance with sop  the company recognizes revenue from the sale of software licenses if all of the following conditions are met first  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement with the customer  second  the product has been delivered to the customer  third  the amount of the fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable  and  fourth  collection of the fee is probable 
each of these factors  particularly the determination of whether a fee is fixed and determinable and the collectability of the resulting receivable  requires the application of the judgment and the estimates of management 
therefore  significant management judgment is utilized and estimates must be made in connection with the revenue we recognize in any accounting period 
we analyze various factors  including a review of the nature of the license or product sold  the terms of each specific transaction  the vendor specific objective evidence of the elements required by sop  any contingencies that may be present  our historical experience with like transactions or with like products  the creditworthiness of the customer  and other current market and economic conditions 
changes in our judgment based upon these factors and others could impact the timing and amount of revenue that we recognize  and ultimately the results of operations and our financial condition 
therefore  the recognition of revenue is a key component of our results of operations 
at the time of the sale of our software license on a purchase license basis  we assess whether the fee associated with the transaction is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction before recording immediate revenue recognition  assuming all other elements of revenue recognition are present 
billings to our customers are generally due within to days  with payment terms up to days available to certain credit worthy customers 
we believe that we have sufficient history of collecting all amounts within these normal payment terms and to conclude that the fee is fixed or determinable at the time of the perpetual license sale 
we consider all arrangements with payment terms longer than days not to be fixed or determinable and for arrangements involving the extended payment terms exceeding days  revenue recognition occurs when payments are collected  assuming all other elements of revenue recognition are present 
in addition  in assessing whether collection is probable or not for a given transaction  and therefore whether we should recognize the revenue  we make estimates regarding the creditworthiness of the customer 
initial creditworthiness is assessed through internal credit check processes  such as credit applications or third party reporting agencies 
creditworthiness for transactions to existing customers primarily relies upon a review of their prior payment history 
we do not request collateral or other security from our customers 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon the receipt of payment or other change in circumstance 
during fiscal  ilinc launched its enterprise unlimited perpetual licensing model  that enables customers to pay a one time up front fee for unlimited  organization wide web conferencing  with revenue recognized at the time of the sale of the enterprise unlimited perpetual license 
the annual maintenance and support fees and hosting fees associated with an ilinc enterprise unlimited license are based upon a fixed rate per seat license that is active on each annual anniversary of the ilinc enterprise unlimited license agreement and that is approximately equivalent to the to charged for concurrent seat perpetual license contracts 
customers may expand the number of active seats available to them at any time with a corresponding increase in annual maintenance and hosting fees being charged with the additional revenue recognized on a straight line basis over the period of the contract 
sales of concurrent licenses on an asp and per minute basis historically and on a continuing basis  a majority of our license revenue has been generated under the software purchase model basis  with revenue recognized based on a one time sale of a perpetual license 
in addition to that purchase model software sale  we also offer a more flexible concurrent connection seat license and a pay per minute usage based model 
under our asp model  a customer may subscribe to a certain number of concurrent connections or seats for a fixed period  often a year 
under this asp method  we recognize the revenue associated with these monthly  fixed fee subscription arrangements each month on a straight line basis over the term of the agreement 
other customers choose to avoid annual commitments and instead use our web conferencing and audio conferencing products and services based upon a per minute or usage based pricing model 
per minute customers may also include those customers on an asp model that incur overage fees for usage in excess of the permitted number of seats or minutes in excess of the minimum commitment 
the per minute fees that include overage fees are charged at the end of each month and recorded as revenue at the end of each month as the services are provided 
customers with contractually established minimum per minute fees are assessed the greater of the established minimum or the actual usage at the end of each month 
customers wishing to avoid monthly commitments may use the e commerce portion of our web site that permits the use of our web conferencing services on a pay per use basis  with no monthly minimum  purchasing the services and paying for those services online by credit card 
sales of maintenance  hosting  and other related services the company offers with each sale of its software products a software maintenance  upgrade  and support arrangement 
these contracts may be elements in a multiple element arrangement or may be sold in a stand alone basis 
revenues from maintenance and support services are recognized ratably on a straight line basis over the term that the maintenance service is provided 
maintenance contracts typically provide for month terms with maintenance contracts available up to months 
the company typically charges to of the software purchase price for a month contract with discounts available for longer term agreements 
the annual maintenance and support fees and hosting fees associated with an ilinc enterprise unlimited license are based upon a fixed rate per seat license that is active on each annual anniversary of the ilinc enterprise unlimited license agreement and that is approximately equivalent to the to charged for concurrent seat perpetual license contracts 
the company also typically charges to for hosting of purchase model software sales for customers who do not wish to install and host the ilinc suite on their own premises or that of a co location facility 
charges for hosting are likewise spread ratably over the term of the hosting agreement  with the typical hosting agreement having a term of months  with renewal on an annual basis 
revenues from consulting  training  and education services are recognized either as the services are performed  ratably over a subscription period  or upon completing a project milestone if defined in the agreement 
these consulting  training  and education services  are not considered essential to the functionality of our products as these services do not alter the product capabilities  do not require specialized skills  and are often performed by the customer or our var s customers without access to those services 
implementation  consulting  training  translation  and other event type services may also be sold in conjunction with the sale of our software products 
those services are generally recognized as the services are performed or earlier when all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
although the company may provide implementation  training  and consulting services on a time and materials basis  a significant portion of these services have been provided on a fixed fee basis 
should the sale of our software involve an arrangement with multiple elements for example  the sale of a software license along with the sale of maintenance and support to be delivered over the contract period  we allocate revenue to each component of the arrangement using the residual value method based on the fair value of the undelivered elements 
we defer revenue from the arrangement equivalent to the fair value of the undelivered elements and recognize the remaining amount at the time of the delivery of the product or when all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
fair values for the ongoing maintenance and support obligations are based upon separate sales of renewals of maintenance contracts 
fair value of services  such as training or consulting  is based upon separate sales of these services to other customers 
thus  these types of arrangements require us to make judgments about the fair value of undelivered arrangements 
sales of custom content development services a component of our maintenance and professional services revenue is derived from custom content development services 
the sale of custom content development services often involves the execution of a master service agreement and corresponding work orders describing the deliverable due  the costs involved  the project milestones  and the payments required 
these custom content development services are primarily outsourced to a subcontractor  interactive alchemy 
for contracts and revenues related exclusively to custom content development services  the company recognizes revenue and profit as work progresses on custom content service contracts using the percentage of completion method 
this method relies on estimates of total expected contract revenue and costs as each job progresses throughout the relevant contract period 
the company follows this method since reasonably dependable estimates of the costs applicable to various stages of a custom content service contract can be made 
recognized revenues and profit are subject to revisions as the custom content service contract progresses to completion 
revisions in profit estimates are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
customers sometimes request modifications to projects in progress which may result in significant revisions to cost estimates and profit recognition  and the company may not be successful in negotiating additional payments related to the changes in scope of requested services 
should this arise  the provision for any estimated losses on uncompleted custom content service contracts are made in the period in which such losses become evident 
there were no such losses at march  for any custom content development services 
for arrangements requiring customer acceptance  revenue is deferred until the earlier of the end of the acceptance period or until written notice of acceptance is received from the customer 
sales by vars and agents the company has engaged organizations within the united states of america and in other countries that market and sell its products and services through their sales distribution channels that are value added resellers vars 
the vars primarily sell  on a non exclusive basis  our ilinc suite of web conferencing products and predominately sell purchase model perpetual licenses for installation and hosting by the var s customer 
the company s var contracts have terms of one to two years and are automatically renewed for an additional like term unless either party terminates the agreement for breach or other financial reasons 
each var purchases the product from the company and resells the product to its customers 
under those var agreements  the company records only the amount paid by the var as revenue and recognizes revenue when all revenue recognition criteria have been met 
the company also engages organizations that act as mere agents or distributors of its products agents  without title passing to the agent and with the agent only receiving a commission on the consummation of the sale to our customer 
the company records revenue on sales by agents on a gross basis before commissions due to the agent and only when all revenue recognition criteria are met as would be with a sale by the company directly to a customer not involving an agent 
sales reserves the sales reserve is an estimate for losses on receivables resulting from customer credits  cancellations and terminations and is recorded  if at all  as a reduction in revenue at the time of the sale 
increases to sales reserve are charged to revenue  reducing the revenue otherwise reportable 
the sales reserve estimate is based on an analysis of the historical rate of credits  cancellations  and terminations 
the accuracy of the estimate is dependent on the rate of future credits  cancellations  and terminations being consistent with the historical rate 
if the rate of actual credits  cancellations and terminations is different than the historical rate  revenue would be different from what was reported 
as of march   we did not believe that an accrual for sales reserves was necessary  and we will continue to assess the adequacy of the sales reserve account balance on a quarterly basis 
allowance for doubtful accounts we record an allowance for doubtful accounts to provide for losses on accounts receivable due to customer credit risk 
increases to the allowance for doubtful accounts are charged to general and administrative expense as bad debt expense 
losses on accounts receivable due to financial distress or failure of the customer are charged to the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance estimate is based on an analysis of the historical rate of credit losses 
the accuracy of the estimate is dependent on the future rate of credit losses being consistent with the historical rate 
if the rate of future credit losses is greater than the historical rate  then the allowance for doubtful accounts may not be sufficient to provide for actual credit losses 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is  as of march    and  respectively  as march  and and is based on our historical collection experience 
any adjustments to these accounts are reflected in the income statement for the current period  as an adjustment to revenue in the case of the sales reserve and as a general and administrative expense in the case of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
software development costs the company accounts for software development costs in accordance with statements of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed  whereby costs for the development of new software products and substantial enhancements to existing software products are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established  at which time any additional costs are capitalized 
technological feasibility is established upon completion of a working model 
costs of maintenance and customer support are charged to expense when related revenue is recognized or when those costs are incurred  whichever occurs first 
software development costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility have not been significant to date  and all software development costs have been charged to research and development expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
intangible assets on april   the company adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets and as a result  the company s goodwill is no longer amortized 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill be tested annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise for impairment 
upon initial application of sfas no 
 the company determined there was no impairment of goodwill 
the company has established the date of march on which to value its goodwill 
the company has made acquisitions of companies having operations or technology in areas within its strategic focus and has recorded goodwill and other intangible assets associated with its acquisitions 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of the underlying acquired operations could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the goodwill and other intangible assets thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
the company  based in part on a third party full scope valuation with a valuation date of march   has determined that impairment of that goodwill and intangible assets was not required 
based upon that third party valuation and further analysis performed  the company s management believes no such impairment exists at march  debt issuance costs are amortized using the straight line method over the term of the related debt obligations 
other intangibles primarily consist of the learnlinc and glyphics purchase consideration that was allocated to purchased software and customer relationship intangibles 
such other intangibles are amortized over their expected benefit period of to months 
income taxes the company utilizes the liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred taxes are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted marginal tax rates currently in effect when the differences reverse 
the company has recorded a full valuation allowance to reduce the carrying value of its net deferred tax assets because it has concluded that it is more likely than not that it will not be realized 
the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
in the event the company was to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase net income in the period such a determination was made 
stock based compensation in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment to sfas no 
sfas no 
provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method on accounting for stock based employee compensation 
the company has adopted the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
and accordingly the implementation of sfas no 
did not have a material affect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r 
under this new standard  companies will no longer be able to account for share based compensation transactions using the intrinsic method in accordance with apb instead  companies will be required to account for such transactions using a fair value method and to recognize the expense over the service period 
sfas r will be effective for periods beginning after june  and allows for several alternative transition methods 
the company expects to adopt sfas r in its first quarter of fiscal on a prospective basis  which will require recognition of compensation expense for all stock option or other equity based awards that vest or become exercisable after the effective date 
we are currently assessing the impact of this proposed statement on our share based compensation programs  however  we expect that the requirement to expense stock options and other equity interests that have been or will be granted to employees will increase our operating expenses and result in lower earnings per share 
guarantees and indemnifications the company provides a limited day warranty for certain of its software products 
historically  claims by customers under this limited warranty have been minimal  and as such  no warranty accrual has been provided for in the company s consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 
guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others an interpretation of fasb statements no 
 and and rescission of fin the following is a summary of the company s agreements that the company has determined are within the scope of fin no 
under its bylaws  the company has agreed to indemnify its officers and directors for certain events or occurrences arising as a result of the officers or directors serving in such capacity 
the term of the indemnification period is for the officer or director s lifetime 
the maximum potential amount of future payments the company could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited 
however  the company has a director and officer liability insurance policy that limits its exposure and enables it to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 
as a result of its insurance policy coverage  the company believes the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements is minimal and has no liabilities recorded for these agreements as of march  the company enters into indemnification provisions under i its agreements with other companies in its ordinary course of business  typically with business partners  contractors  and customers  landlords and ii its agreements with investors 
under these provisions the company generally indemnifies and holds harmless the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party as a result of the company s activities or  in some cases  as a result of the indemnified party s activities under the agreement 
the maximum potential amount of future payments the company could be required to make under these indemnification provisions is unlimited 
the company has not incurred material costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification agreements 
as a result  the company believes the estimated fair value of these agreements is minimal 
accordingly  the company has no liabilities recorded for these agreements as of march  recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r 
under this new standard  companies will no longer be able to account for share based compensation transactions using the intrinsic method in accordance with apb instead  companies will be required to account for such transactions using a fair value method and to recognize the expense over the service period 
sfas r will be effective for periods beginning after june  and allows for several alternative transition methods 
the company expects to adopt sfas r in its first quarter of fiscal on a prospective basis  which will require recognition of compensation expense for all stock option or other equity based awards that vest or become exercisable after the effective date 
we are currently assessing the impact of this proposed statement on our share based compensation programs  however  we expect that the requirement to expense stock options and other equity interests that have been or will be granted to employees will increase our operating expenses and result in lower earnings per share 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the following discusses our exposure to market risk related to changes in interest rates  equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
market risk generally represents the risk of loss that may result from the potential change in the value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in interest rates and market prices 
we have not traded or otherwise bought and sold derivatives nor do we expect to in the future 
we also do not invest in market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
we provide our products and services to customers in the united states  europe and elsewhere throughout the world 
sales are predominately made in us dollars  however  we have sold products that were payable in euros and canadian dollars 
a strengthening of the us dollar could make our products and services less competitive in foreign markets 
the primary objective of the company s investment activity is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  the company maintains its portfolio of cash equivalents in a variety of money market funds 
as of march   the carrying value of our outstanding convertible redeemable subordinated notes and unsecured senior notes was approximately million at fixed interest rates of to 
in certain circumstances  we may redeem this long term debt 
our other components of indebtedness of  bear interest rates of to 
increases in interest rates could increase the interest expense associated with future borrowings  if any 
we do not hedge against interest rate increases
