item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
forward looking statements and risk factors you should read the following discussion together with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and other financial information in this form k report 
the discussions under the subheadings review of market segments and geographies below are in local currency unless indicated otherwise 
company management considers local currency growth an important measure because by excluding the volatility of exchange rates  underlying volume growth is clearer 
as used below  indicates that the company has rounded the relevant data up or down to the nearest one half percentage point 
dollar amounts discussed below are in thousands  unless otherwise indicated  except per share dollar amounts 
in addition  per share dollar amounts are discussed on a diluted basis 
the matters discussed in this annual report on form k contain forward looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of these statements are based on current company expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties  which could cause actual results to differ materially 
all statements regarding future performance  earnings projections  earnings guidance  events or developments are forward looking statements 
such risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to changes in product mix and product pricing particularly as we expand our systems business in which we experience significantly longer sales cycles and less predictable revenue with no certainty of future revenue streams from related consumable product offerings and services  increases in costs of manufacturing and operating costs including energy and raw materials  the company s ability to achieve the savings anticipated from cost reduction and margin improvement initiatives including the timing of completion of the facilities rationalization initiative  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates  regulatory approval and market acceptance of new technologies  changes in business relationships with key customers and suppliers including delays or cancellations in shipments  success in enforcing patents and protecting proprietary products and manufacturing techniques  successful completion or integration of acquisitions  domestic and international competition in the company s global markets  and global and regional economic conditions and legislative  regulatory and political developments 
the company makes these statements as of the date of this report and undertakes no obligation to update them 
business reorganization in fiscal year  the company undertook to reorganize its business structure into three underlying vertically integrated business groups life sciences  comprising medical and biopharmaceuticals markets  aeropower  comprising aerospace and the machinery equipment portion of the current general industrial marketplace  and process technologies  comprising general industrial s food beverage  fuels chemicals  power generation  municipal water and microelectronics markets 
in fiscal year  management began a further integration of the industrial groups aeropower and process technologies to form one vertically integrated industrial business group 
this reorganization has been substantially completed and the company s new structure consists of two vertically integrated business groups life sciences and industrial 
each business group has integrated support functions and responsibility for global manufacturing  sales and marketing and research and development functions to enable the company to better meet its customers needs and in order to achieve greater efficiencies and profit growth 
this revised organizational structure is in contrast to the former matrix organizational structure where  within each geography  these functions supported the market based part of the matrix on a shared basis as opposed to being directly vertically integrated into these business groups 
senior management of the company  including the company s chief executive officer  manages the company and makes key decisions about the allocation of company resources based on the two business units 
the company s sales subsidiaries sell both life sciences and industrial products 
as such  overhead costs of these subsidiaries have been  and will continue to be  shared by the businesses 
since the company has changed its management approach  organizational structure  operating performance assessment and internal business unit financial reporting  a change to the manner in which the company presents segment information in its financial statements will result 
the accounting and financial reporting systems at each of the company s entities  as well as at the corporate office  were assessed for conversion to support the strategic reorganization of the business and the requirements of management in the new structure 
additionally  certain of the internal segment financial reporting accounting principles utilized in the measurement and evaluation of the profitability of the company s business groups such as the allocation of shared overhead costs are also being reassessed for consistency with the underlying reorganized structure of the company 
the company expects to begin utilizing a new global financial reporting system in the first quarter of fiscal  reflecting financial results of the business groups consistent with how they will be managed and measured 

back to contents critical accounting policies and estimates the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
these accounting principles require the company to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
although these estimates are based on company management s knowledge of current events and actions it may undertake in the future  actual results may differ from estimates 
the following discussion addresses the company s most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results  and that require judgment 
see also the notes accompanying the consolidated financial statements  which contain additional information regarding the company s accounting policies 
purchase accounting and goodwill determining the fair value of certain assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with sfas no 
is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
there are various methods used to estimate the value of tangible and intangible assets acquired  such as discounted cash flow and market multiple approaches 
some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the two approaches include projected future cash flows including timing  discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in the future cash flows  perpetual growth rate  determination of appropriate market comparables  and the determination of whether a premium or a discount should be applied to comparables 
there are also judgments made to determine the expected useful lives assigned to each class of assets and liabilities acquired 
goodwill is measured as the excess of the cost of acquisition over the sum of the amounts assigned to identifiable assets acquired less liabilities assumed 
the company performs goodwill impairment tests at least annually  including whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment might have occurred 
in response to changes in industry and market conditions  the company could be required to strategically realign its resources and consider restructuring  disposing of  or otherwise exiting businesses  which could result in an impairment of goodwill 
based on impairment tests performed  there was no impairment of goodwill in fiscal years  and revenue recognition revenue is recognized when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer and when contractual terms have been fulfilled 
long term contracts are accounted for under the percentage of completion method based upon the ratio of costs incurred to date compared with estimated total costs to complete them 
the cumulative impact of revisions to total estimated costs is reflected in the period of the change  including anticipated losses 
such revisions could result in a material adjustment in the period of the change 
allowance for doubtful accounts company management evaluates its ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances when collection becomes doubtful 
in performing this evaluation  significant estimates are involved  including an analysis of specific risks on a customer by customer basis 
based upon this information  company management records in earnings an amount believed to be uncollectible 
if the historical data used to calculate the allowance provided for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables  additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and the future results of operations could be materially affected 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost principally on the first in  first out method or market 
the company records adjustments to the carrying value of inventory based upon assumptions about historic usage  future demand and market conditions 
these adjustments are estimates which could vary significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from actual requirements if future conditions  customer inventory levels or competitive conditions differ from the company s expectations 

back to contents recoverability of available for sale investments other than temporary losses relating to available for sale investments are recognized in earnings when company management determines that the recoverability of the cost of the investment is unlikely 
such losses could result in a material adjustment in the period of the change 
company management considers numerous factors  on a case by case basis  in evaluating whether the decline in market value of an available for sale security below cost is other than temporary 
such factors include  but are not limited to  i the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost  ii the financial condition and the near term prospects of the issuer of the investment  and iii whether company management intends to retain the investment for the period of time is sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
defined benefit retirement plans the company sponsors defined benefit retirement plans in various forms covering substantially all employees who meet eligibility requirements 
several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events are used in calculating the expense and liabilities related to those plans for which the benefit is actuarially determined ie  defined benefit plans 
these factors include assumptions about the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as determined by the company  within certain guidelines 
in addition  the company s actuarial consultants also use subjective factors  such as withdrawal and mortality rates  to calculate the liabilities and expense 
the actuarial assumptions used by the company are long term assumptions and may differ materially from actual experience in the short term due to changing market and economic conditions and changing participant demographics 
these differences may have a significant effect on the amount of pension expense recorded by the company 
pension expense associated with our defined benefit plans was  in fiscal year  which was based on a weighted average discount rate of calculated using the projected benefit obligation and a weighted average expected long term rate of return on plan assets of calculated using the fair value of plan assets 
the expected rates of return on the various defined benefit pension plans assets are based on the asset allocation of each plan and the long term projected return of those assets 
if the expected long term rate of return on plan assets was reduced by basis points  projected pension expense in fiscal year would have increased approximately  the objective of the discount rate assumption is to reflect the rate at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled 
the company s methodology for selecting the discount rate for the us plans as of july  was to match the plan s cash flows to that of a yield curve that provides the equivalent yields on zero coupon corporate bonds for each maturity 
benefit cash flows due in a particular year can be settled theoretically by investing them in the zero coupon bond that matures in the same year 
the discount rate is the single rate that produces the same present value of cash flows 
the discount rate assumption for non us plans reflects the market rate for high quality  fixed income debt instruments 
both discount rate assumptions are based on the expected duration of benefit payments for each of the company s pension plans as of the annual measurement date and is subject to change each year 
if the weighted average discount rate was reduced by basis points  pension expense in fiscal year would have increased by approximately  accrued expenses and contingencies company management estimates certain material expenses in an effort to record those expenses in the period incurred 
when no estimate in a given range is deemed to be better than any other  the low end of the range is accrued 
the accrual requiring the most judgmental estimation relates to environmental proceedings 
environmental accruals are recorded based upon historical costs incurred and estimates for future costs of remediation and on going legal expenses which have a high degree of uncertainty 
self insured workers compensation insurance accruals are recorded based on insurance claims processed  including applied loss development factors as well as historical claims experience for claims incurred but not yet reported 
self insured employee medical insurance accruals are recorded based on medical claims processed as well as historical medical claims experience for claims incurred but not yet reported 
differences between estimates and assumptions and actual results could result in an accrual requirement materially different from the calculated accrual 

back to contents income taxes significant judgment is required in determining the worldwide income tax expense provision 
in the ordinary course of a global business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenue sharing and cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities  the process of identifying items of revenue and expense that qualify for preferential tax treatment and segregation of foreign and domestic income and expense to avoid double taxation 
no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in the company s historical income tax provisions and accruals 
such differences could have a material effect on the company s income tax provision and net earnings in the period in which such a determination is made 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount of future tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized 
while company management has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  there is no assurance that the valuation allowance would not need to be increased to cover additional deferred tax assets that may not be realizable 
any increase in the valuation allowance could have a material adverse impact on the company s income tax provision and net earnings in the period in which such determination is made 
results of operations compared with review of consolidated results sales for the fiscal year increased to billion from billion in fiscal year exchange rates reduced reported sales by  primarily due to the strengthening of the us dollar against the euro  british pound and japanese yen during the first nine months of the year  partly offset by the weakening of the us dollar against certain other asian currencies 
in local currency ie  had exchange rates not changed year over year  sales increased 
overall  pricing was flat for the full year  as decreased pricing in the medical segment related to long term contracts in the western hemisphere  was offset by increases achieved in the company s other businesses 
in the fourth quarter  pricing was slightly positive and company management expects pricing to improve by approximately basis points in fiscal year microelectronics sales were up in local currency  as the company continues to benefit from new fabrication construction and strength in the consumer electronics market 
biopharmaceuticals sales increased driven by strong growth in consumables 
general industrial sales were up 
within general industrial  the increase in sales reflects growth in all the submarkets with the exception of municipal water 
medical sales were up reflecting growth in the biosciences portion of the business of and an increase in the blood filtration submarket of 
aerospace sales increased driven by increased military sales and incremental  but discounted  sales attributable to the company s expanded agreement relationship with satair 
refer to discussion below for further details on the satair agreement 
by geography  local currency sales in asia were up with all segments contributing to this gain 
growth was particularly strong in microelectronics 
in europe  sales increased driven by strong growth in biopharmaceuticals and microelectronics 
in the western hemisphere  sales grew as strong growth in microelectronics  biopharmaceuticals and aerospace was partly offset by decreases in medical 
company management expects overall sales growth in local currency to be in the range of in fiscal year compared with fiscal year for a detailed discussion of sales  refer to review of market segments and geographies  below 
cost of sales  as a percentage of sales  increased to from in fiscal year this reflects pricing reductions in medical sales in the western hemisphere as well as a movement toward in line blood filtration in europe and asia  which carry higher prices and profit in dollars but at a reduced margin 
in addition  the increase reflects a mix change within consumables to lower margin sales  such as microelectronics increased sales to oem customers and aeropower sales to satair at lower distributor margins 
cost of sales was also impacted by systems sales increases in energy markets  with lower margins 
in addition  the increase in cost of sales reflects transitional costs  such as training and incremental depreciation on assets to be retired earlier than originally estimated  related to the company s facilities rationalization initiative 
cost of sales was also impacted by increases in energy costs  including costs of utilities in the company s manufacturing plants as well as increases in fuel related commodities  such as plastics and steel which are used to manufacture consumable filters and systems 
furthermore  cost of sales was negatively impacted by stock compensation and the adoption of sfas no 
r and a one time purchase accounting adjustment related to inventory acquired as part of the biosepra acquisition 
these factors were partly offset by savings generated from the company s cost reduction initiatives 
the transitional costs and incremental depreciation related to the facilities rationalization initiative will continue into fiscal year as the company makes progress on this initiative 
company management expects increased pricing and the impact of its cost reduction initiatives  such as facilities rationalization initiatives to offset increases in energy and commodity costs  resulting in a mitigation of gross margin erosion in fiscal year 
back to contents selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of sales decreased to from in fiscal year the decrease reflects savings realized from the company s cost reduction initiatives partly offset by the impact of stock compensation and the adoption of sfas no 
r  which negatively impacted selling  general and administrative expenses by basis points 
the company continues to make progress on its cost reduction initiatives 
the facilities rationalization initiative is expected to reduce the company s footprint by over and result in a global manufacturing headcount reduction 
the company has made progress on this initiative  including outsourcing and closure actions in the company s plant in hamburg germany  which have been virtually completed 
the company has also announced the outsourcing and closure of another small plant in germany 
the company has also announced plans to relocate and outsource manufacturing from its ann arbor facility and completed the sale of a building in california  made redundant by the significant movement of blood bank related manufacturing operations to mexico 
in aggregate  these actions will result in cost savings of approximately  in fiscal year company management expects to announce additional actions throughout fiscal and expects annualized savings from this initiative to grow to  plus a further  in tax savings by the end of fiscal year the facilities rationalization initiative is expected to be substantially complete by the end of fiscal year additionally  the company has launched a major initiative to optimize its european operations europall with the objective of delivering improvements in profitability 
net savings generated from the europall initiative as well as from the company s divisional realignment were approximately  in fiscal year company management expects a similar level of savings in fiscal year based on these factors  company management is expecting selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of sales to decrease approximately basis points in fiscal year compared with fiscal year research and development expenses were  compared to  in fiscal year as a percentage of sales  research and development expenses were as compared with last year 
company management expects research and development expenses to be about of sales in fiscal year in fiscal year  the company recorded restructuring and other charges  net  of  primarily comprised of severance and other costs in connection with the company s divisional realignment and on going cost reduction initiatives including its facilities rationalization and europall initiatives  partly offset by the reversal of excess restructuring reserves recorded in fiscal year in addition  the charges include an increase in previously established environmental reserves primarily related to environmental matters in ann arbor  michigan and pinellas park  florida 
restructuring and other charges  net  also includes a gain on the sale of the company s stock rights in satair  which was recorded in the second quarter  as well as a gain on the sale of the company s investment in panacos pharmaceuticals  inc  formerly known as vi technologies  inc 
vitex  that was recorded in the first quarter 
in fiscal year  the company recorded restructuring and other charges  net  of  primarily related to the company s cost reduction initiatives including its divisional realignment plans 
in addition  restructuring and other charges  net  include the write down of the investment in vitex that was deemed other than temporarily impaired and an increase to previously established environmental reserves 
furthermore  restructuring and other charges  net included a charge of  related to the early extinguishment of the company s  private placement unsecured senior notes 
the charge represented the payment to the note holders under the make whole provision of the notes reduced by the carrying value of the notes 
the details of the charges for the years ended july  and july  can be found in the restructuring and other charges  net note accompanying the consolidated financial statements 

back to contents the following table summarizes the activity related to restructuring liabilities that were recorded in fiscal years  and severance lease termination liabilities other total original charge a utilized other changes b balance at july  original charge utilized other changes b balance at july  utilized reversal of excess reserves c other changes b balance at july  original charge utilized balance at july  utilized reversal of excess reserves c other changes b balance at july  a amounts reflected as severance liabilities for fiscal year exclude related to non cash stock compensation 
b other changes reflect translation impact 
c reflects the reversal of excess restructuring reserves originally recorded in fiscal years and net interest expense decreased to  from  in fiscal year the decrease in net interest expense primarily reflects the impact of lower debt levels throughout the year 
company management expects net interest expense in fiscal year to increase to approximately  in fiscal year  the company recorded a one time charge of  in the provision for income taxes for the tax effect of repatriation of foreign subsidiary earnings allowed under the american jobs creation act of ajca 
refer to the liquidity and capital resources section of this management s discussion and analysis for further discussion 
the underlying tax rate ie  the tax rate on earnings before income taxes  excluding restructuring and other charges and the tax effect of repatriation was in fiscal  unchanged from fiscal year company management expects that its underlying tax rate in fiscal year will be consistent with fiscal year  and improve  as more manufacturing is located into tax advantaged locations 
net earnings in fiscal year were  or per share  compared with net earnings of  or per share in fiscal year in summary  net earnings reflects organic sales growth  an improvement in selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of sales  and a decrease in net interest expense 
this was offset by the impact of lower gross margins  a  one time charge representing the tax effect of repatriation of foreign subsidiary earnings and the impact of stock compensation and the adoption of sfas no 
r  which negatively impacted net earnings by cents per share 
in addition  net earnings reflect restructuring and other charges  net  of  compared to  in fiscal year company management estimates that foreign currency translation reduced net earnings by approximately cent per share 

back to contents on december   the company and satair signed an agreement whereby satair acquired the exclusive rights to the western hemisphere commercial aerospace aftermarket distribution channel for the company s products for a ten year period 
the transaction was valued at  of which  was paid to the company in cash on the closing date  and  in a five year non interest bearing note receivable  payable in equal installments 
in addition  the agreement required satair to purchase certain finished goods inventory from the company valued at  the  in cash and notes receivable received for the distribution rights were recorded as deferred revenue and are being amortized as an increase to sales over the life of the distribution agreement 
the transaction was accretive to earnings in fiscal year and is expected to be accretive in future years 
company management expects earnings per share for fiscal year to be in the range of per share inclusive of severance and other restructuring costs and incremental depreciation relating to its cost reduction initiatives which are estimated to be in the range of per share after pro forma tax effect

back to contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company s primary market risks relate to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
the sensitivity analyses presented below assume simultaneous shifts in each respective rate  and quantify the impact on the company s earnings and cash flows 
the changes used for these analyses reflect the company s view of changes that are reasonably possible over a one year period 
actual changes that differ from the changes used for these analyses could yield materially different results 
foreign currency the company s reporting currency is the us dollar 
because the company operates through subsidiaries or branches in over thirty countries around the world  its earnings are exposed to translation risk when the financial statements of the subsidiaries or branches  as stated in their functional currencies  are translated into the us dollar 
company management estimates that foreign exchange translation reduced earnings per share by cent in fiscal year most of the company s products are manufactured in the us  including puerto rico  germany and the united kingdom  and then sold into many countries 
the primary foreign currency exposures relate to adverse changes in the relationships of the us dollar to the british pound the pound  the japanese yen the yen and the euro  as well as adverse changes in the relationship of the pound to the euro 
exposure exists when the functional currency of the buying subsidiaries weakens against the us dollar  the pound or the euro thus causing an increase of the product cost to the buying subsidiary or a reduction in the sales price from the selling subsidiary  which adversely affects the company s consolidated gross margin and net earnings 
the effect of foreign exchange is partially mitigated because of the significant level of manufacturing done in europe 
the deterioration of the yen against the us dollar has a greater proportional adverse effect on the company s earnings because the majority of japan s purchases are sourced from the us in fiscal year  the euro  the pound and the yen weakened by approximately  and  respectively  against the us dollar compared with the average exchange rates in effect in fiscal year additionally  the euro weakened against the pound by approximately 
due to the difficulty in estimating the economic effect of foreign currency rates  particularly in periods of high volatility of such rates  company management does not provide such estimated effects and reports only the translation effect to earnings per share disclosed above 
the company is also exposed to transaction risk from adverse changes in exchange rates 
these short term transaction exposures are primarily yen  euro  pound  singapore dollar and australian dollar denominated receivables held in the us and euro denominated receivables held in the united kingdom 
these short term exposures to changing foreign currency exchange rates are managed by purchasing forward foreign exchange contracts forwards to offset the earnings and cash flow impact of non functional currency denominated receivables and payables as well as the expeditious payment of balances 
in addition  the company enters into loans denominated in foreign currencies to offset the earnings and cash flow impact of nonfunctional currency denominated receivables 
the company does not enter into forwards for trading purposes 
at july   these exposures amounted to approximately  and were offset by forwards with a notional principal amount of  if a hypothetical simultaneous adverse change had occurred in exchange rates  net earnings would have decreased by approximately  or approximately cents per share 
interest rates the company is exposed to changes in interest rates  primarily due to its financing and cash management activities  which include long and short term debt as well as cash and certain short term  highly liquid investments considered to be cash equivalents 
the company s debt portfolio is comprised of both fixed and variable rate borrowings 
the company manages the composition of the portfolio  and concurrently interest rate exposure by employing interest rate swaps 
giving effect to interest rate swaps  the company s debt portfolio was approximately variable rate at july   compared to variable rate at july  as of july   the company had cash flow interest rate swaps ie  variable to fixed rate swaps with notional amounts aggregating  outstanding 
the fair value of the interest rate swaps at july  was an asset of the cash flows on the above mentioned interest rate swaps mirror the cash flows of the hedged underlying debt instruments 
the company does not enter into interest rate swaps for trading purposes 

back to contents for the year ended july   interest expense  net of interest income  was  a hypothetical increase in market interest rates over the actual fiscal year average rate would have increased net interest expense by approximately
