item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note segment and geographical information 
we originated as the rainier pulp paper company founded in shelton  wa in in  we became rayonier incorporated  a public company traded on the new york stock exchange nyse  until  when we became a wholly owned subsidiary of itt corporation itt 
on february   rayonier again became an independent public company after itt distributed all of rayonier s common shares to itt stockholders 
our shares are publicly traded on the nyse under the symbol ryn 
we are a north carolina corporation with executive offices located at north laura street  jacksonville  fl our telephone number is effective january   we restructured the company as a real estate investment trust reit 
under this structure  we are generally not required to pay federal income taxes on our timber harvest operations and other reit qualifying activities contingent upon meeting applicable distribution  income  asset  shareholder and other tests 
however  we are subject to corporate taxes on built in gains the excess of fair market value over tax basis at january  on taxable sales of property by our reit during the first ten years following our election to be taxed as a reit 
our us timber operations are conducted by a wholly owned subsidiary  rayonier forest resources  lp rfr 
we transferred our non reit qualifying operations  which continue to pay corporate level tax on earnings  to our wholly owned taxable subsidiary  rayonier trs holdings inc trs 
these operations include our performance fibers  wood products and trading businesses  as well as the sale and development of high value real estate referred to as higher and better use  or hbu properties 
an increasing portion of our acreage has become  or is emerging as  more valuable for development  recreational or conservation purposes than for growing timber 
to maximize the value of these properties  we expanded our focus from sales of medium and large tracts of land to include more value added activities such as seeking entitlements and implementing infrastructure improvements directly or in participation with other developers 
in  we established a real estate subsidiary  terrapointe llc  to lead these development activities  a president was elected to head terrapointe and senior executives were recruited to expand the organization 
under this new structure  our real estate operations are considered a separate operating and reportable business segment as defined by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 

table of contents in  we entered into a joint venture jv with rreef infrastructure  the global infrastructure investing arm of deutsche asset management  under which the jv purchased approximately  acres of new zealand timberlands  including  acres from rayonier 
in addition to having an equity investment in the jv  we manage the timberlands of the jv 
the jv s timber harvest operations are subject to new zealand income taxes  however they are reit qualifying and therefore  we will generally not be required to pay us federal income taxes on our equity earnings 
see note joint venture investment for additional information 
also in  we sold our medium density fiberboard mdf business in new zealand 
as such  the wood products segment has been restated to exclude the operations and assets of mdf for all periods presented 
see note sale of medium density fiberboard business mdf for additional information 
timber our timber segment owns  leases or manages approximately million acres of timberlands  sells standing timber at auction to third parties  and sells delivered logs 
see chart in item properties for additional information 
our southeastern us timberlands consist of approximately million acres located in georgia  florida and alabama 
these timberlands proximity to pulp  paper and wood products facilities results in significant competition for the purchase of timber 
approximately percent of our timber harvest represents high value timber sold primarily to lumber mills 
the balance is used for making pulp and paper 
softwoods are the predominant species on our southeastern us timberlands and include loblolly and slash pine  while hardwoods include red oak  sweet gum  black gum  red maple  cypress and green ash 
our northwestern us timberlands consist of approximately  acres primarily on the olympic peninsula in western washington state and consist primarily of softwood second growth trees with approximately percent hemlock and the remainder douglas fir  western red cedar and spruce 
our hardwood timber stands consist principally of red alder and maple 
as previously mentioned  we entered into a jv during our investment of approximately million  representing a percent equity interest  was made primarily by our reit 
in addition to having an equity investment  we manage the jv s  acres of timberlands for which we receive a management fee 
see note joint venture investment for additional information on the jv 
we manage timberlands to scientifically develop them to their maximum value 
the average rotation harvest age for timber from the southeastern us primarily southern pine is years 
the average harvest age for timber from the northwestern us primarily hemlock and douglas fir is years with a target age of years 
timber in the southeast is primarily saw timber and pulpwood  while timber in the northwest is primarily saw timber 
we manage timberlands in conformity with the requirements of the sustainable forestry initiative sfi program 
a key to success is the application of our extensive silvicultural expertise to species selection for plantations  soil preparation  thinning of timber stands  pruning of selected species  fertilization  and careful timing of the harvest  all of which are designed to maximize value while complying with environmental requirements 
through such practices  we have increased volume per acre of managed timber available for harvest from our southeastern us timberlands by approximately percent per year 
this is a primary factor behind an increasing pine harvest trend over the past years 
the following table sets forth timberland acres in thousands as of december   by region and by timber classification region softwood plantations hardwood lands non forest total southeast us northwest us new zealand australia total excludes approximately thousand acres of hbu land currently held by the real estate segment 
acres under rayonier management  owned and leased by the jv

table of contents softwood merchantable timber inventory is an estimate of timber volume based on the earliest economically harvestable age 
hardwood inventory is an estimate of timber volume available for harvest 
estimates are based on an inventory system that continually involves periodic statistical sampling 
adjustments are made on the basis of growth estimates  harvest information and market conditions which may impact the economical harvesting of timber located in wetlands  or other marginal geographic areas 
timber located in swamplands  restricted and environmentally sensitive areas is not included in the merchantable inventory shown below 
the following table sets forth the estimated volumes of merchantable timber by location and type  as of december  region softwood hardwood total equivalent total  in thousands of short green tons southeast  in thousands of short green tons northwest  in millions of board feet real estate in  we expanded our focus from sales of medium and large tracts of land to include more value added activities  such as seeking entitlements and implementing infrastructure improvements directly or in participation with other developers  and we established a real estate subsidiary  terrapointe llc  to lead these development activities 
our real estate holdings are primarily in the southeast us we segregate these real estate holdings into two groups development and rural properties 
development properties are predominantly located in the eleven coastal counties between savannah  ga and daytona beach  fl  while the rural properties essentially include the balance of our ownership in the southeast 
our real estate holdings in the northwest comprise the other category 
real estate sales for the three years ended december   are summarized in the following table acres sold average price acre acres sold average price acre acres sold average price acre development rural other total acres sold performance fibers we are a leading manufacturer of high performance cellulose fibers with production facilities in jesup  ga and fernandina beach  fl  which have a combined annual capacity of approximately  metric tons 
to meet customers needs  these facilities are capable of manufacturing more than different grades of performance fibers 
the jesup facility can produce approximately  metric tons  or percent of our total capacity and the fernandina beach facility can produce approximately  metric tons  or percent of our total capacity 
sixty two percent of performance fibers sales are exported primarily to customers in asia  europe and latin america 
eighty seven percent of performance fibers sales are made directly by rayonier personnel  with the remainder made through independent sales agents 
this segment includes two major product lines cellulose specialties and absorbent materials 
cellulose specialties we are one of the world s leading producers of specialty cellulose products  most of which are used in dissolving chemical applications that require a highly purified form to produce cellulose acetate and ethers that create high value  technologically demanding products 
our products are used in a wide variety of end uses such as acetate textile fibers  cigarette filters  rigid packaging  lcd screens  photographic film  impact resistant plastics  high tenacity rayon yarn for tires and industrial hoses  pharmaceuticals  cosmetics  detergents  food casings  food products  thickeners for oil well drilling muds  lacquers  paints  printing inks  and explosives 
in addition  cellulose specialties include high value specialty paper applications used for decorative laminates  automotive air and oil filters  shoe innersoles  battery separators  circuit boards and filter media for the food industry 
absorbent materials we are a supplier of performance fibers for absorbent hygiene products 
these fibers are typically referred to as fluff fibers and are used as an absorbent medium in products such as disposable baby diapers  feminine hygiene products  incontinence pads  convalescent bed pads  industrial towels and wipes and non woven fabrics 

table of contents we sold our  ton per year engineered absorbent materials eam facility in november in  this facility accounted for approximately percent of absorbent materials sales and percent of the company s total consolidated sales 
wood products our wood products business segment primarily manufactures and sells dimension lumber used in construction applications 
we operate three lumber manufacturing facilities in the us that produce southern pine lumber  which is generally used for residential and industrial construction 
the mills  located in baxley  swainsboro and eatonton  ga  have a combined annual capacity of approximately million board feet of lumber  while also producing approximately  tons of wood chips for pulp and paper manufacturing 
lumber sales are primarily to customers in the southeastern us rayonier personnel sell the majority of the lumber  however a portion of our sales are made through independent agents 
approximately percent of our lumber mills wood chip production is sold at market prices to our jesup  ga performance fibers facility 
in  these purchases represented approximately percent of that facility s total wood consumption 
on august  we completed the sale of our mdf business to dongwha hong kong international limited for approximately million 
as a result  the wood products segment has been restated to exclude the operations and assets of mdf in all periods presented 
see note sale of medium density fiberboard business mdf for additional information 
other the primary business of our other segment is trading logs  lumber and wood panel products 
we operate domestic and export log trading businesses in the northwest us  new zealand and chile 
all of the sales from our northwest us and new zealand log trading operations are sourced externally 
our chilean log trading activity includes domestic purchases and sales 
we also purchase and trade lumber and wood panel products in both domestic and export markets  and derive royalty income from coal mining activity on our timberlands in lewis county  washington 
discontinued operations and dispositions discontinued operations include our mdf business sold in and our new zealand east coast timberland operations and associated assets sold in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income and the consolidated statements of cash flows and the related notes have been reclassified to present the results of these operations as discontinued operations 
dispositions and other discontinued operations include our port angeles  wa performance fibers mill that was closed in  our wholly owned subsidiary  southern wood piedmont company swp  which ceased operations other than remedial activities in  our eastern research division erd  which ceased operations in  and other miscellaneous assets held for disposition 
see note reserves for dispositions and discontinued operations for additional information 
foreign sales and operations sales by geographical destination for the three years ended december  were as follows in millions sales by destination united states europe japan china other asia latin america new zealand canada all other a large majority of our sales to foreign countries are denominated in us dollars 
sales from non us operations comprised approximately percent of total sales 
see note segment and geographical information for additional information 

table of contents patents we have patents and pending patent applications that relate to our proprietary performance fibers products and processes and intend to take such steps as are necessary to protect our patents and file applications for future inventions that are deemed important to our business operations 
our us patents have a duration period of years from the date of filing 
competition our timberlands are located in two major timber growing regions the northwest and southeast us  where timber markets are fragmented 
in the northwest  the campbell group  hancock timber resource group  green diamond resource company  weyerhaeuser  and washington state department of natural resources are significant competitive suppliers 
other competition in the northwest arises from log imports from canada 
in the southeast  we compete with plum creek timber company  international paper  timber investment management organizations timos  and many small  non industrial land owners 
in all markets  price is the principal method of competition 
in  international paper  a major southeast us timberland owner  announced plans to sell substantially all of its timberlands 
it is currently not known who will purchase these properties and the impact  if any  the sales will have on competition in this region 
we market performance fibers worldwide against strong competition from domestic and foreign producers 
our major competitors include international paper  weyerhaeuser  koch industries  buckeye technologies  and saiccor 
pricing  product performance  and technical service are principal methods of competition 
in october  weyerhauser announced plans to permanently close its  metric ton cellulose specialty pulp mill located in cosmopolis  washington in separately  saiccor announced a  ton per year expansion at one of its cellulose specialty pulp mills in south africa  and sateri international announced construction of a  ton per year cellulose specialty pulp mill in bahia  brazil 
the status of these projects is currently unclear  although it is possible that one or both of them could be producing product in the aggregate impact of the facility closure and potential new market capacity is not expected to adversely affect the results of our performance fibers segment in  although there can be no assurances as to the effects for and beyond given the current uncertainty of market dynamics 
our wood products business competes with a number of lumber producers throughout the us and canada but particularly with sawmills throughout georgia and florida 
our lumber business represents less than one half of one percent of north american capacity 
customers in  no single customer or group of customers under common control represented percent or more of our consolidated sales  however two customers comprised and percent  respectively  of the performance fibers segment s sales  and one customer comprised percent of the timber segment s sales 
the loss of any of these customers could have a material adverse effect on these segments results of operations 
in  a group of customers under the common control of eastman chemical company and its affiliates represented approximately percent of our performance fibers segment s sales and percent of our consolidated sales 
in  no single customer or group of customers under common control represented percent or more of any segment s sales or our consolidated sales 
seasonality our timber segment sales are generally lower in the third quarter due to greater availability of non rayonier timber during the drier summer harvesting period  particularly in the northwestern us our wood products segment may experience higher seasonal demand in the second quarter primarily due to increased new housing construction 
our performance fibers segment s results are normally not impacted by seasonal changes 
environmental matters see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations environmental regulation and note contingencies 
raw materials the manufacture of performance fibers and lumber requires significant amounts of wood and recycled fiber 
in the us  timber harvesting is restricted by weather conditions  which at times affect our ability to harvest  legal challenges and pressure 
table of contents from various environmental groups 
supply is also subject to price changes in wood products and in pulp and paper markets  which can result in increased demand for timber 
in  hardwood pricing increased modestly from levels  primarily due to higher transportation costs and a weather related reduction in supply 
our performance fibers mills and southeast us lumber facilities obtain their logs through open market purchases made by our wood procurement organization  which negotiates prices with independent third party suppliers who deliver to our facilities 
in some cases  third party logging contractors may have purchased timber cutting rights from our timberlands in georgia and florida generally through a sealed bid process 
performance fibers manufacturing also requires significant amounts of fuel oil and natural gas 
these raw materials are subject to significant changes in prices and availability  which could adversely impact our future operating results 
we continually pursue reductions in usage and costs of other key raw materials  supplies and contract services at our performance fibers and lumber mills and do not foresee any material constraints in the near term from pricing or availability 
research and development in jesup  ga  we maintain one of the preeminent research facilities and staff in the industry 
our research and development efforts are directed primarily at further developing existing core products and technologies  improving the quality of cellulose fiber grades  absorbent materials and related products  improving manufacturing efficiency and environmental controls  and reducing fossil fuel consumption 
the research and development activities of our timber operations include genetic tree improvement programs as well as applied silvicultural programs to identify management practices that will improve financial returns from our timber assets 
our total research and development expenditures were approximately million in  million in  and million in employee relations we currently employ approximately  people  of whom approximately  are in the united states  and percent are covered by labor contracts 
most of our hourly employees are represented by one of several labor unions 
labor relations are maintained in a normal and satisfactory manner 
in august and december  jesup s labor agreements  covering approximately hourly employees  were extended through june  in december of  prior to the expiration of the april fernandina labor agreements covering approximately hourly employees  the two unions representing these employees approved a four year contract which will run through there were no changes to the jesup labor contracts in sustainable forestry while it is our objective to increase future wood supply through forest management programs that increase timberland productivity  we have a longstanding commitment to meet the highest levels of forest stewardship and to promote sustainable forestry practices throughout the industry 
as a member of the american forest and paper association  we subscribe to the sfi program  a comprehensive system of environmental principles  objectives and performance measures that combines the perpetual growing and harvesting of trees with the protection of wildlife  plants  soil and water quality 
our us timberlands and wood procurement practices have been audited and certified by an independent third party under the sfi program 
the independent certification verifies that we meet strict requirements for growing and harvesting trees in an environmentally responsible manner that protects natural resources  renews forests  creates biological diversity  and enhances wildlife protection 
in addition  the jv participates in various environmental initiatives such as the forest owners association and the new zealand forest accord

table of contents item a 
risk factors our operations are subject to a number of risks  including those listed below 
when considering an investment in our securities  you should carefully read and consider these risks  together with all other information in this report 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition or operating results as well as the market price of our securities could be materially adversely affected 
business and operating risks the cyclical nature of our businesses could adversely affect our results of operations 
our financial performance is affected by the cyclical nature of the forest products and real estate industries 
the markets for timber  real estate  cellulose specialties products and wood products are influenced by a variety of factors beyond our control 
for example  the demand for real estate can be affected by changes in interest rates  local economic conditions and population growth and demographics  the demand for saw timber is primarily affected by the level of new residential and commercial construction activity  while supply of timber and logs has historically increased during favorable pricing environments 
changes in global market trends and world events could impact customer demand 
the global reach of our business  particularly our performance fibers business and our interest in the jv  causes us to be subject to unexpected  uncontrollable and rapidly changing events and circumstances in addition to those experienced in the us adverse changes in the following factors  among others  could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations effects of exposure to currency other than the united states dollar  regulatory  social  political  labor or economic conditions in a specific country or region  and trade protection laws  policies and measures and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment  including loss or modification of exemptions for taxes and tariffs  and import and export licensing requirements 
the forest products and real estate industries are highly competitive 
many of our competitors in the forest products businesses have substantially greater financial and operating resources and own more timberlands than we do 
some of our forest products competitors may also be lower cost producers in some of the businesses in which we operate 
in addition  wood products are subject to significant competition from a variety of non wood and engineered wood products 
we are also subject to competition from forest products  including logs  imported from foreign sources to the united states as well as to the export markets served by us 
to the extent there is a significant increase in competitive pressures from substitute products or other domestic or foreign suppliers  our business could be substantially adversely affected 
with respect to our real estate business  we are currently transitioning from a bulk land seller to obtaining entitlements and initiating improvements through partnerships with other developers 
as a result  many of our competitors in this segment have greater experience in real estate development than we do 
changes in energy and raw materials prices could impact our operating results and financial condition 
energy and raw material costs  such as oil  natural gas  wood  and chemicals are a significant operating expense  particularly for our performance fibers and wood products businesses 
the prices of raw materials and energy can be volatile and are susceptible to rapid and substantial increases due to factors beyond our control such as changing economic conditions  political unrest and instability in energy producing nations  and supply and demand considerations 
for example  oil and natural gas costs have increased substantially in recent years and we have recently experienced  at times  a limited availability of hardwood which has resulted in increased production costs for some performance fibers products 
increases in production costs could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our businesses are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations that may restrict or adversely impact our ability to conduct our business 
if regulatory and environmental permits are delayed  restricted or rejected  a variety of operations on our timberlands could be delayed or restricted 
in connection with a variety of operations on our properties  we are required to seek 
table of contents permission from agencies in the states and countries in which we operate to perform certain activities 
any of these agencies could delay review of  or reject  any of our filings 
any delay associated with a filing could result in a delay or restriction in replanting  thinning  insect control  fire control or harvesting  any of which could have an adverse effect on our operating results 
for example  in washington state  we are required to file a forest practice application for each unit of timberland to be harvested 
these applications may be denied or restricted by the regulatory agency or appealed by other parties  including citizen groups 
appeals or actions of the regulatory agencies could delay or restrict timber harvest activities pursuant to these permits 
delays or harvest restrictions on a significant number of applications could have an adverse effect on our operating results 
in addition  many of our capital projects require various environmental permits 
delays in obtaining these permits could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
environmental groups and interested individuals may seek to delay or prevent a variety of operations on our timberlands 
we expect that environmental groups and interested individuals will intervene with increasing frequency in the regulatory processes in the states and countries where we own  lease or manage timberlands 
in washington state  environmental groups and interested individuals may appeal individual forest practice applications or file petitions with the forest practices board to challenge the regulations under which forest practices are approved 
these and other challenges could materially delay or prevent operations on our properties 
delays or restrictions due to the intervention of environmental groups or interested individuals could adversely affect our operating results 
in addition to intervention in regulatory proceedings  interested groups and individuals may file or threaten to file lawsuits that seek to prevent us from implementing our operating plans 
any lawsuit or even a threatened lawsuit could delay harvesting on our timberlands 
among the remedies that could be enforced in a lawsuit is a judgment entirely preventing or restricting harvesting on a portion of our timberlands 
the impact of existing regulatory restrictions on future harvesting activities may be underestimated 
federal  state and local laws and regulations  as well as those of other countries  which are intended to protect threatened and endangered species  as well as waterways and wetlands  limit and may prevent timber harvesting  road building and other activities on our timberlands 
the threatened and endangered species restrictions apply to activities that would adversely impact a protected species or significantly degrade its habitat 
the size of the area subject to restriction will vary depending on the protected species at issue  the time of year and other factors  but can range from less than one to several thousand acres 
a number of species that naturally live on or near our timberlands  including the northern spotted owl  marbled murrelet  bald eagle  several species of salmon and trout in the northwest  and the red cockaded woodpecker  bald eagle  wood stork  red hill salamander  and flatwoods salamander in the southeast  are protected under the federal endangered species act or similar state laws 
as we gain additional information regarding the presence of threatened or endangered species on our timberlands  or if regulations become more restrictive  the amount of our timberlands subject to harvest restrictions could increase 
our manufacturing operations  and in particular our performance fibers and wood products mills  are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations concerning air emissions  wastewater discharge  water usage and waste handling and disposal 
many of our operations are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations and permits which contain conditions that govern how we operate our facilities and  in many cases  how much product we can produce 
these laws  regulations and permits  now and in the future  may restrict our current production and limit our ability to increase production  and impose significant costs on our operations with respect to environmental compliance 
it is expected that  overall  these costs will likely increase over time as environmental laws  regulations and permit conditions become more stringent 
we currently own or may acquire properties which may require environmental remediation or otherwise be subject to environmental and other liabilities 
we currently own  or formerly operated  manufacturing facilities and discontinued operations  or may acquire timberlands and other properties  which are subject to environmental liabilities  such as cleanup of hazardous material contamination and other existing or potential liabilities of which we are not currently aware 
while timberlands without any prior history of industrial development do not generally carry as high a risk of environmental contamination as current and former manufacturing operations  the cost of investigation and remediation of contaminated properties could increase operating costs and adversely affect financial results 
although we believe we have adequate reserves for the investigation and remediation of our current properties  there can be no assurance that actual expenditures will not exceed our expectations 
environmental laws and regulations are constantly changing  and are generally becoming more restrictive 
laws  regulations and related judicial decisions and administrative interpretations affecting our business are subject to change and new laws and regulations that may affect our business are frequently enacted 
these changes may adversely affect our ability to harvest and sell timber  operate our manufacturing facilities and or develop real estate 
these laws and regulations may relate to  among other things  the protection of timberlands  endangered species  timber harvesting 
table of contents practices  recreation and aesthetics  air and water quality  and remedial standards for contaminated property and groundwater 
over time  the complexity and stringency of these laws and regulations have increased markedly and the enforcement of these laws and regulations has intensified 
we believe that these laws and regulations will continue to become more restrictive and over time could adversely affect our operating results 
development of real estate entails a lengthy  uncertain and costly approval process 
development of real estate entails an extensive approval process involving overlapping regulatory jurisdictions 
for example  in florida  real estate projects must generally comply with the provisions of the local government comprehensive planning and land development regulation act the growth management act and local land use and development regulations 
in addition  in florida  development projects that exceed certain specified regulatory thresholds require approval of a comprehensive development of regional impact dri application 
compliance with the growth management act  local land development regulations and the dri process is usually lengthy and costly and significant conditions can be imposed on a developer with respect to a particular project 
any of these issues can be expected to materially affect the cost and timing of our real estate development activities 
other issues affecting real estate development include the availability of potable water for new development projects 
for example  in georgia  the legislature recently enacted the comprehensive statewide watershed management planning act the watershed management act  which  among other things  created a governmental entity called the georgia water council which is charged with preparing a comprehensive water management plan for the state and presenting it to the georgia legislature for adoption no later than it is unclear at this time what this plan will provide or how it will affect the cost and timing of real estate development along the i coastal corridor in southern georgia  where the company has significant real estate holdings 
changes in the interpretation or enforcement of these laws  the enactment of new laws regarding the use and development of real estate  or the identification of new facts regarding our properties could lead to new or greater costs  delays and liabilities that could materially adversely affect our business  profitability or financial condition 
changes in demand for our real estate and delays in the timing of real estate transactions may affect our revenues and operating results 
a number of factors  including changes in demographics  a slowing of commercial or residential real estate development  particularly along the i coastal corridor in florida and georgia  could reduce the demand for such properties and negatively affect our results of operations 
in addition  there are inherent uncertainties in the timing of real estate transactions that could adversely affect our operating results 
delays in the completion of transactions or the termination of potential transactions can be caused by factors beyond our control 
these events have in the past and may in the future adversely affect our operating results 
our joint venture partners may have interests that differ from ours and may take actions that adversely affect us 
we participate in a joint venture in new zealand  and may enter into other joint venture projects  for example  as part of our real estate development strategy 
a joint venture involves special risks such as not having voting control over the joint venture  the venture partner at any time may have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours  the venture partner may take actions contrary to our instructions or requests  or contrary to our policies or objectives with respect to the investment  and the venture partner could experience financial difficulties 
actions by our venture partners may subject property owned by the joint venture to liabilities greater than those contemplated by the joint venture agreement or have other adverse consequences 
we may be unsuccessful in carrying out our acquisition strategy 
we intend to pursue acquisitions of strategic timberland and real estate properties 
our timberland and real estate acquisitions may not perform in accordance with our expectations 
we anticipate financing any such acquisitions through cash from operations  borrowings under our credit facilities  proceeds from equity or debt offerings or proceeds from asset dispositions  or any combination thereof 
our inability to finance acquisitions on favorable terms or the failure of any acquisitions to perform to our expectations  could adversely affect our operating results 

table of contents our failure to maintain satisfactory labor relations could have a material adverse effect on our business 
approximately percent of our work force is unionized 
these workers are almost exclusively in our performance fibers business 
as a result  we are required to negotiate the wages  benefits and other terms with many of our employees collectively 
our financial results could be adversely affected if labor negotiations were to restrict the efficiency of our operations 
our inability to negotiate acceptable contracts with any of these unions as existing agreements expire could result in strikes or work stoppages by the affected workers 
if the unionized employees were to engage in a strike or other work stoppage  or other employees were to become unionized  we could experience a significant disruption of our operations  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we have a significant amount of debt and the capacity to incur significant additional debt 
as of december   we had million of debt outstanding 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contractual financial obligations and off balance sheet arrangements for the payment schedule of our long term debt obligations 
we expect that existing cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities  cash provided from operations  and our bank credit facilities will be sufficient to meet ongoing cash requirements 
moreover  we have the borrowing capacity to incur significant additional debt and may do so if we enter into one or more strategic  merger  acquisition or other corporate or investment opportunities  or otherwise invest capital in one or more of our businesses 
however  failure to generate sufficient cash as our debt becomes due  or to renew credit lines prior to their expiration  may adversely affect our business  financial condition  operating results  and cash flow 
weather and other natural conditions may limit our timber harvest and sales 
weather conditions  timber growth cycles and restrictions on access may limit harvesting of our timberlands  as may other factors  including damage by fire  insect infestation  disease  prolonged drought and natural disasters 
we do not insure against losses of timber from any causes  including fire 
the volume and value of timber that can be harvested from our timberlands may be reduced by fire  insect infestation  severe weather  disease  natural disasters  and other causes beyond our control 
a reduction in our timber inventory could adversely affect our financial results and cash flows 
as is typical in the industry  we do not maintain insurance for any loss to our timber  including losses due to these causes 
a significant portion of the timberland that we own  lease or manage is concentrated in limited geographic areas 
we own  lease or manage approximately million acres of timberland and real estate located primarily in the united states and new zealand 
approximately million acres are located principally in georgia  florida and alabama 
accordingly  if the level of production from these forests substantially declines  or if the demand for timber in those regions declines  it could have a material adverse effect on our overall production levels and our revenues 
we are dependent upon attracting and retaining key personnel 
we believe that our success depends  to a significant extent  upon our ability to attract and retain key senior management and operations management personnel 
our failure to recruit and retain these key personnel could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 
market interest rates may influence the price of our common shares 
one of the factors that may influence the price of our common shares will be the annual dividend yield as compared to yields on other financial instruments 
thus  an increase in market interest rates will result in higher yields on other financial instruments  which could adversely affect the price of our common shares 
reit and tax related risks if we fail to qualify as a reit or fail to remain qualified as a reit  we will have reduced funds available for distribution to our shareholders because our income will be subject to taxation at regular corporate rates 
we intend to operate in accordance with reit qualifications under the internal revenue code of  as amended the code 
as a reit  we generally will not pay corporate level tax on income we distribute to our shareholders other than the income of trs as long as we distribute at least percent of our reit taxable income determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding net capital gain 
qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the code  which are subject to change  perhaps retroactively  and which are 
table of contents not entirely within our control 
we cannot assure that we will qualify as a reit or be able to remain so qualified or that new legislation  us treasury regulations  administrative interpretations or court decisions will not significantly affect our ability to qualify as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification 
if in any taxable year we fail to qualify as a reit  we will suffer the following negative results we will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to shareholders in computing our taxable income  and we will be subject to federal income tax on our reit taxable income at regular corporate rates 
in addition  we will be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which the qualification was lost  unless we are entitled to relief under certain provisions of the code 
as a result  our net income and the funds available for distribution to our shareholders could be reduced for up to five years or longer 
if we fail to qualify as a reit  we may need to borrow funds or liquidate some investments or assets to pay the additional tax liability 
accordingly  funds available for distribution to our shareholders would be reduced 
the extent of our use of taxable reit subsidiaries may affect the price of our common shares relative to the share price of other reits 
we conduct a portion of our business activities through one or more taxable reit subsidiaries 
our use of taxable reit subsidiaries enables us to engage in non reit qualifying business activities such as the production and sale of performance fibers and wood products  real estate development  sales and development of hbu property and timberlands as a dealer  sales of logs and lump sum sales of timber 
taxable reit subsidiaries are corporations subject to corporate level tax 
therefore  we pay income taxes on the income generated by our taxable reit subsidiaries 
under the code  no more than percent of the value of the gross assets of a reit may be represented by securities of one or more taxable reit subsidiaries 
this limitation may affect our ability to increase the size of our taxable reit subsidiaries operations 
furthermore  our use of taxable reit subsidiaries may cause the market to value our common shares differently than the shares of other reits  which may not use taxable reit subsidiaries as extensively as we use them 
lack of shareholder ownership and transfer restrictions in our articles of incorporation may affect our ability to qualify as a reit 
in order to qualify as a reit  an entity cannot have five or fewer individuals who own  directly or indirectly after applying attribution of ownership rules  percent or more of its outstanding voting shares during the last six months in each calendar year 
although it is not required by law or the reit provisions of the code  almost all reits have adopted ownership and transfer restrictions in their articles of incorporation or organizational documents which seek to assure compliance with that rule 
while we are not in violation of the ownership rules  we do not have  nor do we have any current plans to adopt  share ownership and transfer restrictions 
as such  the possibility exists  however remote  that five or fewer individuals could acquire percent or more of our outstanding voting shares  which could result in our disqualification as a reit 
we may be limited in our ability to fund distributions using cash generated through our taxable reit subsidiaries 
our ability to receive dividends from our taxable reit subsidiaries is limited by the rules with which we must comply to maintain our status as a reit 
in particular  at least percent of gross income for each taxable year as a reit must be derived from sales of our standing timber and other types of qualifying real estate income and no more than percent of our gross income may consist of dividends from our taxable reit subsidiaries and other non qualifying income 
this limitation on our ability to receive dividends from our taxable reit subsidiaries may impact our ability to fund distributions to stockholders using cash flows from our taxable reit subsidiaries 
despite these restrictions  we have the ability to transfer cash from our taxable reit subsidiaries to our reit through intercompany real estate sales 
however  these transactions would be subject to federal income tax 
the net income of our taxable reit subsidiaries is not required to be distributed to us  and income that is not distributed will not be subject to the percent income distribution requirement 
certain of our business activities are potentially subject to prohibited transactions tax 
as a reit  we will be subject to a percent tax on any net income from prohibited transactions 
in general  prohibited transactions are sales or other dispositions of property to customers in the ordinary course of business 
sales of 
table of contents performance fibers and wood products which we produce  sales of logs and lump sum sales of timber  sales of timberlands or other real estate as a dealer and certain development activities relating to real estate  could  in certain circumstances  constitute prohibited transactions 
we intend to avoid the percent prohibited transactions tax by conducting activities that would otherwise be prohibited transactions through one or more taxable reit subsidiaries 
we may not  however  always be able to identify timberland properties that will become part of our dealer real estate sales business 
therefore  if we sell timberlands which we incorrectly identify as property not held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business or which subsequently become properties held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business  we face the potential of being subject to the percent prohibited transactions tax 
we will have potential deferred and contingent tax liabilities 
we will be subject to a federal corporate level tax at the highest regular corporate rate currently percent on any gain recognized from a taxable sale of any asset which we held at january   the effective date of our reit status election  that occurs within ten years of that date 
however  we will be subject to such tax only to the extent of the difference between our tax basis and the fair market value of those assets as of january  the built in gain 
gain from a taxable sale of those assets occurring more than ten years after january  will not be subject to this corporate level tax 
in addition  the irs may assert liabilities against us for corporate income taxes for taxable years prior to the time we qualified as a reit  in which case we will owe these taxes plus interest and penalties  if any 
moreover  any increase in taxable income for those years will result in an increase in accumulated earnings and profits  or e p  which could cause us to pay an additional taxable distribution to our then existing shareholders within days of the relevant determination 
our cash dividends are not guaranteed and may fluctuate 
generally  reits are required to distribute percent of their taxable income 
however  reits are required to distribute only their ordinary taxable income and not their net capital gains income 
accordingly  we do not believe that we are required to distribute material amounts of cash given that substantially all of our taxable income is treated as capital gains income 
our board of directors  in its sole discretion  determines the amount of quarterly dividends to be provided to our stockholders based on consideration of a number of factors 
these include  but are not limited to  our results of operations  cash flow and capital requirements  economic conditions  tax considerations  borrowing capacity and other factors  including debt covenant restrictions that may impose limitations on cash payments  future acquisitions and divestitures  harvest levels  changes in the price and demand for our products and general market demand for timberlands including those timberland properties that have higher and better uses 
consequently  our dividend levels may fluctuate 
we may not be able to complete like kind exchange transactions for all real estate we sell 
when we sell real estate  we generally seek to match these sales with the acquisition of suitable replacement real estate 
this allows us to claim like kind exchange treatment for these transactions under section and related regulations of the code 
this matching of sales and purchases provides us with significant tax benefits  most importantly the deferral of any gain on the property sold until ultimate disposition of the replacement property 
while we attempt to complete like kind exchanges wherever practical  we will not be able to do so in all instances due to various factors  including the lack of availability of suitable replacement property on acceptable terms and inability to complete a qualifying like kind exchange transaction within the timeframes required by the code 
the inability to obtain like kind exchange treatment would result in the payment of taxes with respect to the property sold  and a corresponding reduction in earnings and cash available for distribution to shareholders as dividends

also in dispute is disposal liability for approximately  tons of recycled material from sites operated by swp that are still owned and retained by the processor 
swp  doj and ldeq have been engaged in discussions regarding a settlement of this matter 
on july   doj filed a motion to dismiss swp s amended complaint in intervention in this case and  in the event the swp complaint was not dismissed by the court  filed an answer to the complaint 
doj also asked the court for leave to file a counterclaim against swp and the company  which would assert claims for cost recovery under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of cercla in respect of the investigation and remediation of the sites owned by the third party processor

table of contents item m anagement s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary our revenues  operating income and cash flows are primarily derived from three core business segments timber  real estate and performance fibers 
we own or lease under long term agreements approximately million acres of timberland and real estate in florida  georgia  alabama and washington and are the th largest private landowner in the united states 
in new zealand  we have a percent interest in a jv which owns or leases approximately  acres of timberland 
our real estate segment seeks to maximize the value of those properties which are more valuable for development  recreational or conservation uses than for growing timber 
our performance fibers business has been a supplier of premier cellulose specialty grades of pulp for over seventy five years 
we have consistently produced strong cash flows and operating results by focusing on the following critical financial measures operating income  ebitda  adjusted cash available for distribution  debt to capital ratio  return on equity  return on fair market value timber and real estate and return on capital employed performance fibers 
in addition to these financial measures  we also focus on cash available for distribution  in total and on a per share basis 
key non financial measures include safety performance  quality  production as a percent of capacity and various yield statistics 
our focus is on maximizing returns for shareholders and generating consistently strong cash flows 
as a reit  we expect to be more competitive in pursuing timberland acquisitions to further grow the company and ultimately distribute more earnings to shareholders in a tax efficient manner 
during  the quarterly dividend was increased twice by and percent in february and october  respectively  resulting in the annual dividend increasing to million from million in since  we have used cash flow to reduce debt by approximately million  resulting in a current debt to capital ratio of percent 
we believe that a debt to capital range of to percent is appropriate to keep our weighted average cost of capital low while maintaining an investment grade debt rating and retaining the flexibility to actively pursue growth opportunities 
accordingly  we do not expect to significantly reduce debt in and  in connection with appropriate growth opportunities  may incur additional debt that causes us to exceed the debt to capital range mentioned above 
operational strategies timber is sold primarily through an auction process  although in the northwest us we also market timber through log supply agreements 
timber is treated as a stand alone business  requiring our mills and trading groups to compete with third party bidders for timber at auction 
this promotes realizing market value  generating a true reflection of fair value returns in timber  while also minimizing the possibility of our manufacturing facilities being subsidized with below market cost wood 
we also focus on optimizing timber returns by continually improving productivity and yields through advanced silvicultural practices which take into account soil  climate and biological considerations 
an increasing portion of our acreage has become  or is emerging as  more valuable for development  recreational or conservation purposes than for growing timber 
to maximize the value of those properties  we changed our strategy from selling real estate in bulk to becoming more involved in the development of these properties 
in  we established a real estate subsidiary  terrapointe llc  to lead these development activities and we are currently discussing a number of projects with potential development partners 
in performance fibers  the focus has been to improve our position as a premier supplier of cellulose specialties while reducing participation in the more commodity oriented absorbent materials primarily fluff pulp market 
we are a market leader in cellulose specialties  utilizing our considerable technical applications expertise to customize product to exacting specifications  which allows differentiation from most other competitors 
conversely  fluff pulp is a semi commodity with little opportunity for differentiation other than by price  although we do explore ways to enhance the value of these fibers 
there are a number of much larger companies in the fluff pulp market and we are not a market leader 
we have been successful in executing a strategy of shifting production from absorbent materials to cellulose specialties 
in and  percent of volume was cellulose specialties  versus percent in since a further significant shift of volume to cellulose specialties will be operationally limited  our focus will be on improving product mix within cellulose specialties 
cost control is a critical element to remaining competitive in the performance fibers markets 
the keys to success are operating continuously  safely  and efficiently while closely managing raw materials and conversion costs 
capital expenditures 
table of contents typically are directed toward cost reduction and efficiency projects 
we use a significant amount of fossil fuels to operate our mills 
with the recent surge in energy prices we have initiated a number of capital projects to reduce fossil fuel consumption 
as a result  we expect capital expenditures to increase to approximately million 
industry and market conditions market conditions over the past three years have shown improvement 
in us timber markets  prices have steadily increased since late as demand for lumber increased due to strong housing  commercial construction and industrial sectors  a competitive exchange rate and tariffs imposed on wood imports from canada 
in the southeast us  the impact of three major hurricanes in resulted in lower volumes and some temporary price erosion before gradual improvement in our southeast us hbu properties have consistently generated strong interest which increased throughout  especially after the formation of terrapointe llc 
in performance fibers  cellulose specialties market demand remains strong 
sales are typically made using one to five year contracts which establish prices and target volumes at the beginning of the year and buffer some of the changes in supply and demand 
our recognized technical and market leadership has allowed us to maintain relatively stable pricing across our cellulose specialties product lines 
in  international paper closed its natchez  mississippi mill  a major cellulose specialties competitor  taking approximately  tons of capacity out of the market 
this was the primary driver of and price and volume increases in cellulose specialties 
in  weyerhaueser announced plans to permanently close its  metric ton cellulose specialty mill located in cosmopolis  washington  in despite these closures  we expect additional capacity to come on line from competitors in the southern hemisphere sometime in through over the past three years  absorbent materials industry capacity has met demand resulting in a relatively small pricing range 
however  absorbent materials prices strengthened in  consistent with the commodity paper pulp market  while volumes improved 
sales of absorbent materials are typically made with an annual volume agreement that allows price to move with the market during the year 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  reported in this annual report on form k 
we base these estimates and assumptions on historical data and trends  current fact patterns  expectations and other sources of information we believe are reasonable 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different conditions 
merchantable inventory and depletion costs as determined by forestry timber harvest models significant assumptions and estimates are used in the recording of timberland inventory cost and depletion 
we employ a forestry technical services group at each of our timberland management locations 
merchantable standing timber inventory is estimated annually  using industry standard computer software 
the inventory calculation takes into account growth  in growth annual transfer of oldest pre merchantable age class into the merchantable inventory  timberland sales and the annual harvest specific to each business unit 
the age at which timber is considered merchantable is reviewed periodically and updated for changing harvest practices  future harvest age profiles and biological growth factors 
an annual depletion rate is established at each business unit by dividing merchantable inventory book cost by standing merchantable inventory 
pre merchantable records are maintained for each planted year age class  recording acres planted  stems per acre  and costs of planting and tending 
changes in the assumptions and or estimations used in these calculations may affect our results  in particular  timber inventory and depletion costs 
factors that can impact timber volume include weather changes  losses due to natural causes  differences in actual versus estimated growth rates and changes in the age when timber is considered merchantable 
a percent company wide change in estimated standing merchantable inventory would cause depletion expense to change by approximately million 
in  we acquired  acres of timberland in the northwest us resulting in a higher depletion rate which increased depletion expense by approximately million 
it is anticipated that the full year impact will increase depletion expense by approximately million 
in  we acquired  acres of timberland in the southeast us resulting in a higher depletion rate which increased depletion expense by approximately million and million in and  respectively 

table of contents depreciation of long lived assets as specifically affected by economic obsolescence depreciation expense is computed using the units of production method for the performance fibers plants and equipment and the straight line method on all other property  plant and equipment over the useful economic lives of the assets involved 
we believe that these depreciation methods are the most appropriate under the circumstances as they most closely match revenues with expenses versus other generally accepted accounting methods 
long lived assets are periodically reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
cash flows used in such impairment analyses are based on budgeted results  which take into account recent sales and cost data as well as macroeconomic drivers including customer demand  industry capacity and foreign exchange rates 
the physical life of equipment  however  may be shortened by economic obsolescence caused by environmental regulation  competition and other causes 
environmental costs associated with dispositions and discontinued operations at december   we have million of accrued liabilities for environmental costs relating to past dispositions and discontinued operations  which is expected to be spent over the next years 
see note reserves for dispositions and discontinued operations for additional information 
significant estimates are used in determining the proper value of these obligations at a given point in time  especially due to their long term nature 
typically  these cost estimates do not vary significantly on a quarter to quarter basis 
factors affecting these estimates include  but are not limited to  technological and regulatory changes  results from ongoing work and management s judgment 
we periodically review our environmental liabilities and also engage third party consultants to assess the extent of additional work required due to changes in applicable law and new technologies potentially affecting the remediation of contaminated sites 
a material change in any of the estimates could have a favorable or unfavorable effect on the results of our operations 
the most recent material change in estimate occurred in  when reserves were increased by million for revised estimates of remediation costs required at the closed port angeles  washington mill site 
expenditures for all such environmental costs totaled million in and are expected to increase to million in  primarily as a result of increased spending required at our washington state and southern wood piedmont sites 
annual expenditures in and are expected to be approximately million 
determining the adequacy of pension assets and liabilities we have four qualified benefit plans which cover substantially our entire us workforce and an unfunded plan to provide benefits in excess of amounts allowable under current tax law to participants in the qualified plans 
pension expense for all plans was million in numerous estimates and assumptions are required to determine the proper amount of pension and postretirement liabilities and annual expense to record in our financial statements 
the key assumptions include discount rate  return on assets  salary increases  health care cost trends  mortality rates  longevity and service lives of employees 
although there is authoritative guidance on how to select most of these assumptions  management and actuaries exercise some degree of judgment when selecting these assumptions 
different assumptions  as well as actual versus expected results  would change the periodic benefit cost and funded status of the benefit plans recognized in the financial statements 
in determining pension expense in  a million return was assumed based on an expected long term rate of return of percent 
the actual return for was million 
this long term return assumption calculated using geometric compound averaging was established based on historical long term rates of return on broad equity and bond indices  discussions with our actuary and investment advisors and consideration of the actual annualized rate of return of percent from the date of our spin off from itt corporation through we periodically review this assumption for reasonableness and have determined that the long term rate of return assumption will remain at percent 
at december  our asset mix consisted of percent equities  percent bonds and percent real estate 
we do not expect this mix to change materially in the near future 
in determining future pension obligations  we use a discount rate which is based on rates supplied by our actuary 
the actuarial rates are developed by models which incorporate high quality aaa and aa rated  long term corporate bond rates into their calculations 
the discount rate at december  of percent declined from the year end rate of percent  causing projected benefit obligation pbo to increase by million 
we expect pension expense to increase to million from million in primarily due to the decrease in the discount rate from percent to percent

future requirements will vary depending on actual investment performance  changes in valuation assumptions  interest rates  other employee related matters and changes in legislation 
realizability of both recorded and unrecorded tax assets and liabilities with the conversion to reit status effective january   our income tax provision and deferred tax balances changed materially 
certain activities no longer require tax provisions  and the opportunity to capture tax benefits associated with our reit status has increased 
the realization of these tax opportunities requires extensive planning and in many cases is dependent upon events in the future and our strategy in structuring transactional terms and conditions 
as a result  our effective tax rate and the amount of taxes paid during various fiscal periods can vary greatly 
also  our projection of estimated tax for the year and our provision for quarterly taxes  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  could result in greater variability than in the past 
similarly  the opportunity to realize certain deferred tax assets  or to estimate deferred tax liabilities  may be more subjective than in the past 
for example  we have recorded certain deferred tax assets that management believes will be realized in future periods 
these assets are reviewed periodically in order to assess their realizability 
this review requires us to make assumptions and estimates about future profitability affecting the realization of these tax benefits 
if the review indicates that the realizability may be less than likely  a valuation allowance is made at that time

outlook entering  we have well positioned core businesses and continue to experience strong demand and pricing for most of our products  particularly real estate properties and premium cellulose specialties 
as a result  excluding special items  we expect full year earnings somewhat above  despite a first quarter that will be below fourth quarter  primarily due to the timing of real estate transactions 
in real estate  we continue to focus on building additional value through development of our properties  while in performance fibers we recently implemented price increases for for cellulose specialties

results of operations  versus timber in the northwest us  our timber sales and operating income improved as our timber prices and volume rose percent and percent  respectively  compared to prior year 
in general  the demand for timber in this region increased as the demand for lumber rose due to the strong housing market

cash used for investing activities was million below  reflecting million in net cash proceeds generated from the sale of our new zealand timberlands and million of lower timberland acquisition spending 
in addition  the sale of our mdf facility generated approximately million of cash  while the sale of our eam facility generated approximately million

these measures are not defined by generally accepted accounting principles gaap and the discussion of ebitda and adjusted cad is not intended to conflict with or change any of the gaap disclosures described above 
management considers these measures to be important to estimate the enterprise and shareholder values of the company as a whole and of its core segments  and for allocating capital resources 
in addition  analysts  investors and creditors use these measures when analyzing our financial condition and cash generating ability 
ebitda is defined by the securities and exchange commission  however  adjusted cad as defined may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
ebitda is a non gaap measure of our operating cash generating capacity

liquidity facilities in november  we negotiated a million unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of banks that replaced the previous million facility and rfr s million facility 
this facility  which allows the parent company  rayonier inc and its subsidiaries  trs and rfr  to borrow up to a combined total of million  expires in november we plan to refinance the facility before it expires 
at december  and  there were and million of outstanding borrowings on the revolving credit facility  respectively 
of the million outstanding on the revolving credit facility as of december   million was from refinancing medium term notes that matured in february  while the remaining million was primarily due to financing the intercompany timberland sale from rfr to the trs 
there were no borrowings outstanding as of december  standard poor s ratings services assigned the facility and our long term debt a bbb investment grade rating with a positive outlook 
moody s investors service assigned the facility and our long term debt a baa investment grade rating with a stable outlook 

table of contents in conjunction with our million revolving credit facility  certain covenants must be met  including ratios based on the facility s definition of ebitda covenant ebitda 
covenant ebitda consists of earnings from continuing operations before the cumulative effect of accounting changes and any provision for dispositions  income taxes  interest expense  depreciation  depletion  amortization and the non cash cost basis of real estate sold 
a dividend restriction covenant limits the sum of dividends in any period of four fiscal quarters to percent of covenant funds from operations covenant ffo plus the aggregate amount of dividends permitted under covenant ffo in excess of the amount of dividends paid during the prior four fiscal quarters 
covenant ffo is defined as consolidated net income excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and investments in marketable securities plus depletion  depreciation and amortization and the non cash cost basis of real estate sold 
in addition  there are covenant requirements for rfr setting a minimum ratio of cash flow to fixed charges 
the covenants listed below are calculated on a trailing month basis 
the most restrictive long term debt covenants in effect as of december   were as follows covenant requirement actual ratio at december  favorable unfavorable covenant ebitda to consolidated interest expense should not be less than to to total debt to covenant ebitda should not exceed to to rfr cash flow available for fixed charges to rfr fixed charges should not be less than to to dividends paid should not exceed percent of covenant ffo we are currently in compliance with all of our financial covenants 
in addition to the financial covenants listed above  the credit agreements include customary covenants that limit the incurrence of debt  the disposition of assets  and the making of certain payments between rfr and rayonier among others 
an asset sales covenant in the rfr installment note related agreements requires us  subject to certain exceptions  to either reinvest cumulative timberland sales proceeds in excess of million the excess proceeds in timberland related investments and activities or  once the amount of excess proceeds not reinvested exceeds million  to make an offer to the note holders to prepay the notes ratably in the amount of the excess proceeds 
as of december  and  the amount of excess proceeds was approximately million and million  respectively 
contractual financial obligations and off balance sheet arrangements in addition to using cash flow from operations  we finance our operations through the issuance of debt  and by entering into leases 
these financial obligations are recorded in accordance with accounting rules applicable to the underlying transaction  with the result that some are recorded as liabilities on the balance sheet  while others are required to be disclosed in the notes to consolidated financial statements and management s discussion and analysis

table of contents the nature and purpose of our off balance sheet arrangements are to provide credit support for certain suppliers vendors and customers in case of their default on critical company related obligations  and collateral for certain self insurance programs that we maintain 
these arrangements consist of standby letters of credit and surety bonds 
as part of our ongoing operations  we also periodically issue guarantees to third parties 
off balance sheet arrangements are not considered to be a source of liquidity or capital resource and do not expose us to material risks or material unfavorable financial impacts 
the following table aggregates financial commitments as of december  financial commitments s maximum potential payment carrying amount of liability standby letters of credit guarantees surety bonds total financial commitments approximately million of the standby letters of credit serve as credit support for industrial revenue bonds 
the remaining letters of credit support various insurance coverages  primarily workers compensation and pollution requirements 
these letters of credit will expire at various dates during and are typically rolled over as required 
in conjunction with the sale of our new zealand timberlands to the jv in october see note joint venture investment for additional information  we guaranteed five years of crown forest license obligations with annual potential payments of approximately million 
the jv is the primary obligor and has posted a bank performance bond with the new zealand government 
if the jv fails to pay the obligation  the new zealand government will demand payment from the bank that posted the bond 
we would have to perform if the bank defaulted on the bond 
a thousand liability  representing our obligation to perform  was recorded in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
this guarantee expires in in conjunction with the sale of our new zealand east coast timber operations in  we guaranteed five years of crown forest license obligations 
in late  the buyer defaulted on its loan payments to its creditors and went into receivership with the obligation paid by the receiver 
the property was then re sold 
the new owner is the primary obligor and has posted a bank performance bond with the new zealand government 
if the new owner fails to pay the obligations  the new zealand government will demand payment from the owner s bankers pursuant to the bond 
we would have to perform under the guarantee and seek legal redress from the owner if the bankers defaulted on the bond 
we expect the owner s bond to be sufficient to cover the license obligations 
as of december   two years of obligations remained  estimated at million per year 
this guarantee expires in in  we sold approximately  acres of timberland for approximately million 
a year installment note was received from the buyer  with a fixed interest rate of percent 
in addition  the buyer delivered an irrevocable letter of credit from a major banking institution that secures all payments of principal and interest under the installment note 
we monetized the note by contributing the note and the letter of credit to a bankruptcy remote limited liability subsidiary that meets the requirements of a qualified special purpose entity qspe as defined by sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
as such  the qspe is not consolidated in our financial statements 
using the installment note and the letter of credit as collateral  the qspe issued million of year senior secured notes with a fixed interest rate of percent and remitted cash of million to the company 
at closing  we recorded a retained interest of million in the qspe 
in conjunction with this timberland sale and note monetization  we issued a make whole agreement pursuant to which we guaranteed million of obligations of the qspe 
the fair market value of the guarantee of thousand was recorded to reflect the obligation to perform under the make whole agreement 
in conjunction with our million revolving credit facility  rayonier inc guarantees the borrowings of rfr and trs

environmental regulation rayonier is subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations concerning air emissions  water discharges and waste handling and disposal 
such environmental laws and regulations include the federal clean air act  the clean water act  the resource conservation and recovery act  and the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  and state laws and regulations governing similar activities 
our management closely monitors our environmental responsibilities  and believes that we are in substantial compliance with current environmental requirements 
however  significant expenditures over the next years will be required in the area of environmental compliance 
during  and  we spent approximately million  million and million  respectively  for capital projects related to environmental compliance for ongoing operations 
during and  our spending is expected to decrease to approximately million and million per year  respectively  on such capital projects 
the environmental protection agency epa finalized its cluster rules governing air emissions in but  due to the specialty nature of rayonier s performance fibers products and operations  the agency postponed finalizing water discharge rules and certain air emissions rules governing our two performance fibers dissolving pulp mills and two other similar mills 
the epa uses the term cluster rules to identify parallel rule making for water and air technology based discharge limits for pulp and paper mills 
in late  epa informed us that it was delegating its cluster rule rulemaking authority for these four mills to the environmental agencies of the respective states 
we will continue to work with the epa and the applicable state environmental authorities to establish such rules for our mills  but the timing and costs associated with such rulemaking are uncertain 
it is our opinion that capital costs to be incurred over the next five years associated with cluster rule compliance and other environmental regulations are not expected to exceed million 
such capital expenditures are not expected to cause total capital expenditures  including those relating to environmental  to exceed an annual average of million to million 
federal  state and local laws and regulations intended to protect threatened and endangered species  as well as wetlands and waterways  limit and may prevent timber harvesting  road building and other activities on private lands  including a portion of our timberlands 
in the northwest  in particular  over the past several years the harvest of timber from parts of our timberlands in the state of washington has been both temporarily and permanently restricted as a result of the listing of the northern spotted owl  the marbled murrelet and several species of salmon and trout as threatened species under the endangered species act 
in  the timber industry and federal  state  local and tribal governments  entered into an agreement  known as the forests and fish report  which led the washington forest practices board to adopt rules further restricting timber harvesting within buffers along streams with fish habitat 
all of these restrictions have caused us over time to restructure and reschedule our harvest plans and have reduced the total volume of timber available for harvest 
for the most part  however  these restrictions had been anticipated and we expect to sustain past harvest levels in the foreseeable future 
we currently estimate that expenditures during and for environmental remediation and monitoring costs for all dispositions and discontinued operations will total approximately million per year 
such costs  including monitoring and remediation costs  will be charged against our reserves for estimated environmental obligations which we believe are sufficient for costs expected to be incurred over the next years 
at december   these accrued liabilities totaled approximately million 
the actual future environmental costs will be dependent on the outcome of negotiations with federal and state agencies and may also be affected by changes in applicable laws and regulations  the exercise of discretion in interpretation of applicable law and regulations by governmental agencies and changes in environmental remediation technology 
based on information currently available  we do not believe that any future changes in estimates would materially affect our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market and other economic risks we are exposed to various market risks  including changes in interest rates  commodity prices and foreign exchange rates 
our objective is to minimize the economic impact of these market risks 
we use derivatives in accordance with policies and procedures approved by the finance committee of the board of directors  derivatives are managed by a senior executive committee whose responsibilities include initiating  managing and monitoring resulting exposures 
we do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
cyclical pricing of commodity market paper pulp ultimately influences performance fibers prices  particularly in the absorbent materials product line 
however  since we are a non integrated producer of specialized performance fibers for non papermaking end uses  our high value product mix tends to lag on both the upturn and downturn commodity paper pulp prices with peaks and valleys that are less severe 
we periodically enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rate changes 
these swaps involve the exchange of fixed and variable interest rate payments without exchanging principal amounts 
at december   two interest rate swap agreements were held 
one agreement with a notional amount of million swaps a fixed percent interest rate for a six month libor rate plus percent 
the second agreement with a notional amount of million swaps a fixed percent interest rate for a six month libor rate plus percent 
the fair value of these interest rate swaps at year end  which mature in  was a liability of million 
the market risk resulting from a one percentage point basis points change in the six month libor rate amounts to an approximate change of million in our pre tax income loss 
the fair market value of our long term fixed interest rate debt is also subject to interest rate risk  however  we intend to hold most of our debt until maturity 
occasionally  when favorable economic conditions exist  we opt to refinance callable bonds 
the estimated fair value of our fixed rate debt at december   was million compared to million in carrying value 
generally  the fair market value of fixed rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
a hypothetical one percentage point increase decrease in prevailing interest rates at december   would result in a corresponding decrease increase in the fair value of our fixed rate debt of approximately million 
we periodically enter into commodity forward contracts to fix some of our fuel oil and natural gas costs 
the forward contracts partially mitigate the risk of a change in performance fibers margins resulting from an increase or decrease in these energy costs 
we do not enter into commodity forwards for trading or speculative purposes 
the net amounts paid or received under the contracts are recognized as an adjustment to fuel oil or natural gas expense 
a hypothetical percent increase decrease in the prevailing price of natural gas and fuel oil would result in a change of million and million  respectively  in our pre tax income loss 
our natural gas and fuel oil contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting and as such mark to market adjustments are recorded in other operating income expense  net 
primarily all of our revenues and expenses are us dollar denominated 
however  the jv is subject to the risks of foreign currency fluctuations 
at december   all forward foreign currency contracts to purchase new zealand dollars had matured
