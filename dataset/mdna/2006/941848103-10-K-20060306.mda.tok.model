the amount was determined by identifying research projects for which technological feasibility had not been established and which had no alternative future uses 
as of the creon acquisition date the acquisition date  there were four projects that met the above criteria 
the significant ipr d projects identified consist of the elab notebook and the automatic lc ms dereplication system 
the ipr d charges associated with these projects were million and million  respectively 
management determined the valuation of the ipr d using a number of factors  including engaging a third party valuation firm to provide an independent appraisal 
the value was based primarily on the discounted cash flow method 
this valuation included consideration of i the stage of completion of each of the projects  ii the technological feasibility of each of the projects  iii whether the projects had an alternative future use  and iv the estimated future residual cash flows that could be generated from the various projects and technologies over their respective projected economic lives 
the primary basis for determining the technological feasibility of these projects was whether the product met predetermined design specifications and complex functionality 
as of the acquisition date  none of the ipr d projects had reached predetermined design specifications and complex functionality 
in assessing the technological feasibility of a project  consideration was also given to the level of complexity in future technological hurdles that each project had to overcome 
future residual cash flows that could be generated from each of the projects were determined based upon management s estimate of future revenue and expected profitability of the various products and technologies involved 
these projected cash flows were then discounted to their present values taking into account management s estimate of future expenses that would be necessary to bring the projects to completion 
the discount rates include a rate of return  which accounts for the time value of money  as well as risk factors that reflect the economic risk that the cash flows projected may not be realized 
the cash flows were discounted at discount rates ranging from to per annum  depending on the project s stage of completion and the type of complex functionality needed 
this discounted cash flow methodology for the various projects included in the purchased ipr d resulted in a total valuation of million 
although work on the projects related to the ipr d continued after the acquisition  the amount of the purchase price allocated to ipr d was written off because the projects underlying the ipr d that was being developed were not considered technologically feasible as of the acquisition date

there are other items within the company s consolidated financial statements that require estimation  but are not deemed critical as defined above 
changes in estimates used in these and other items could potentially have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition sales of products and services are generally recorded based on product shipment and performance of service  respectively 
partial proceeds received in advance of product shipment or performance of service are recorded as deferred revenue in the consolidated balance sheets 
once the product is shipped  all advance payments received associated with that particular order are reclassified to accounts receivable to offset against the customer invoice

software upgrades are typically sold as part of a service contract with revenue recognized ratably over the term of the service contract 
loss provisions on accounts receivable and inventory the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the company does not request collateral from its customers but collectibility is enhanced through the use of credit card payments and letters of credit 
the company assesses collectibility based on a number of factors including  but not limited to  past transaction history with the customer  the credit worthiness of the customer  industry trends and the macro economic environment 
sales returns and allowances are estimates of future product returns related to current period revenue 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of revenue for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates for sales returns and allowances for doubtful accounts

long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill the company assesses the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors the company considers important which could trigger an impairment review include but are not limited to the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant negative industry or economic trends  and significant changes or developments in strategic technological collaborations or legal matters which affect the company s capitalized patent  trademark and intellectual properties such as licenses 
when the company determines that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators  it measures any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in the company s current business model

at december   the company s warranty liability was million 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  the company is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
this process involves the company estimating its actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciation  amortization  and inventory reserves  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheets 
the company must then assess the likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent it believes that recovery is not likely  the company must establish a valuation allowance 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  or the company adjusts these estimates in future periods  the company may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact its financial position and results of operations 
the company has a significant income tax benefit associated with the exercise of its nonqualified stock options recorded to additional paid in capital 
historically  the company believed that it was more likely than not that the us deferred tax assets associated with this tax benefit would not be realized and as a result  a valuation allowance was established for all the deferred tax assets relating to us income 
this valuation allowance against us assets was maintained until an appropriate level of taxable income in the us could be sustained 
in  the company believed it had reached an appropriate sustainable level of profitability in the us  therefore  million of the valuation allowance was reversed  of which million was credited to additional paid in capital and the balance was credited to goodwill related to an acquisition the company made in the company made this determination based on a review of the facts and circumstances at that time 
litigation as described in item of part i of this form k  the company is a party to various pending litigation matters 
with respect to each pending claim  management determines whether it can reasonably estimate whether a loss is probable and  if so  the probable range of that loss 
if and when management has determined  with respect to a particular claim  both that a loss is probable and that it can reasonably estimate the range of that loss  the company records a charge equal to either its best estimate of that loss or the lowest amount in that probable range of loss 
the company will disclose additional exposures when the range of loss is subject to considerable interpretation 
with respect to the claims referenced in item  management of the company to date has been able to make this determination  and thus has recorded charges  with respect to the claims described under the heading hewlett packard company 
as developments occur in these matters and additional information becomes available  management of the company will reassess the probability of any losses and of their range  which may result in its recording charges or additional charges  which could materially impact the company s results of operation or financial position 

table of contents pension and other post retirement benefits assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair values of plan assets for the company s pension plans and other post retirement benefits are evaluated periodically by management in consultation with outside actuaries and investment advisors 
changes in assumptions are based on relevant company data 
critical assumptions  such as the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligations and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets are evaluated and updated annually 
the company has assumed that the expected long term rate of return on plan assets will be for its us defined benefit pension plan which is the majority of the company s benefit obligation and expense 
at the end of each year  the company determines the discount rate that reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled 
the company determined the discount rate based on the analysis of the mercer and citigroup pension discount curves for high quality investments and the moody s aa interest rate as of december  that best matched the timing of the plan s future cash flows for the period to maturity of the pension benefits 
once the interest rates were determined  the plan s cash flow was discounted at the spot interest rate back to the measurement date 
at year end  the company determined this rate to be for its us defined benefit pension plan which is the majority of the company s benefit obligation and expense 
post retirement benefit plan discount rates are the same as those used by the company s defined benefit pension plan in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 employers accounting for post retirement benefits other than pensions 
a one quarter percentage point increase in the discount rate would decrease the company s net periodic benefit cost for the us pension plan by approximately million 
a one quarter percentage point change in the assumed long term rate of return would impact the company s net periodic benefit cost for the us pension plan by approximately million

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company operates on a global basis and is exposed to the risk that its earnings  cash flows and stockholders equity could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates 
the company attempts to minimize its exposures by using certain financial instruments  for purposes other than trading  in accordance with the company s overall risk management guidelines 
the company is primarily exposed to currency exchange rate risk with respect to certain inter company balances  forecasted transactions and cash flow  and net assets denominated in euro  japanese yen and british pound 
the company manages its foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis  which allows the company to analyze exposures globally and take into account offsetting exposures in certain balances 
in addition  the company utilizes derivative and non derivative financial instruments to further reduce the net exposure to currency fluctuations 
the company is also exposed to the risk that its earnings and cash flows could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in interest rates 
the company s policy is to manage interest costs by using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt that management believes is appropriate 
at times  to manage this mix in a cost efficient manner  the company has periodically entered into interest rate swaps  in which the company agrees to exchange  at specified intervals  the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional amount 
cash flow hedges the company uses interest rate swap agreements to hedge the risk to earnings associated with fluctuations in interest rates related to outstanding us dollar floating rate debt 
in the fourth quarter of  the company entered into a floating to fixed rate interest rate swap with a notional amount of million  to hedge floating rate debt related to the term loan facility of its outstanding debt  with a maturity date of june for the year ended december   the company recorded cumulative net pre tax unrealized losses of million in accumulated other comprehensive income on this interest rate swap agreement

the total pre tax amount of the gain that was recognized in earnings in was million 
the remaining million was recognized in earnings in over the original term of the interest rate swap

these agreements are designated as foreign currency hedges of a net investment in foreign operations 
any increase or decrease in the fair value of cross currency interest rate swap agreements  forward contracts or range forward contracts is offset by the change in the value of the hedged net assets of the company s consolidated foreign affiliates 
therefore  these derivative instruments are intended to serve as an effective hedge of certain foreign net assets of the company

other the company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts  principally to hedge the impact of currency fluctuations on certain inter company balances 
principal hedged currencies include the euro  japanese yen and british pound 
the periods of these forward contracts typically range from one to three months and have varying notional amounts which are intended to be consistent with changes in inter company balances
