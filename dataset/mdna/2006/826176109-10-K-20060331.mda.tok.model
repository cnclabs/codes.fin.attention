the overall market conditions were weaker in due to rising interest rates  higher oil prices and nearly six weeks of hurricanes in the southeast all of which have created a lack of investor interest in investing in stocks 
consequently  customer trading activity was flat for the company 
competition continued to intensify among all types of brokerage firms  including established discount brokers and new firms entering the on line brokerage business 
electronic trading continues to account for an increasing amount of trading activity  with some firms charging very low trading execution fees that are difficult for any conventional discount firm to meet 
some of these brokers  however  impose asset based charges for services such as mailing  transfers and handling exchanges which the company does not currently impose  and also direct their orders to market makers where they have a financial interest 
continued competition could limit the company s growth or even lead to a decline in the company s customer base  which would adversely affect its results of operations 
industry wide changes in trading practices  such as the new york stock exchange s hybrid market proposal and the increasing use of electronic communications networks  are expected to put continuing pressure on commissions fees earned by brokers while increasing volatility

the company  like other securities firms  is directly affected by general economic and market conditions including fluctuations in volume and prices of securities  changes and the prospect of changes in interest rates  and demand for brokerage and investment banking services  all of which can affect the company s profitability 
in addition  in periods of reduced financial market activity  profitability is likely to be adversely affected because certain expenses remain relatively fixed  including salaries and related costs  portions of communications costs and occupancy expenses 
accordingly  earnings for any period should not be considered representative of earnings to be expected for any other period

the company uses its best judgment  based on its knowledge of revenue transactions and expenses incurred  to estimate the amount of such revenue and expenses
