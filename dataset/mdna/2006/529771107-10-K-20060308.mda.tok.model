refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the company s reportable segments  which is incorporated herein by reference 
operating results summary during  the consumer market segment continued to be impacted by aggressive price competition and promotional activities  and softer than expected supplies sales 
in the business market segment  the company was impacted by mix changes to low end laser printers and price declines  as well as softer than expected supplies sales 
inkjet and laser hardware average unit revenue aur was down approximately and  respectively 
supplies revenue increased in compared to the prior year and increased in compared to the prior year 
the company believes the decrease in supplies revenue growth compared to the prior year was due to year to year yty channel inventory changes in both laser and inkjet supplies and due to weakness in end user demand  particularly in the second half of management expects to see additional negative yty impacts in the first quarter of to improve profitability and the company s cost and expense structure  the company announced two action plans in january first  the company is implementing a more rigorous process to improve lifetime profitability and payback on inkjet sales 
second  the company announced a restructuring plan to improve its costs and expense structure 
the plan includes consolidating supplies manufacturing capacity  reducing costs and expenses in the areas of supply chain  general and administrative expense  as well as marketing and sales support functions and modifying its us retirement plans 
refer to the section entitled results of operations that follows for a further discussion of the company s results of operations 

table of contents trends and opportunities lexmark management believes that the total distributed office and home printing output opportunity exceeded billion in  including hardware  supplies and related services 
this opportunity includes printers and multifunction devices as well as a declining base of copiers and fax machines that are increasingly being integrated into multifunction devices 
based on industry analyst information  lexmark management estimates that this market will grow annually at low to mid single digit percentage rates through market trends driving long term growth include continuing improvement in price performance points  continued convergence in technology between printers  scanners  copiers and fax machines into single  integrated aio devices  advancements in digital photography driving the opportunity to print digital images on distributed output devices  increased adoption of color output in business  and advancements in electronic movement of information  driving more pages to be printed by end users when and where it is convenient to do so 
as a result of these market trends  lexmark has growth opportunities in low end monochrome laser printers  color lasers  laser aios  photo aios  and business inkjet four in ones 
laser printer unit growth in recent years has generally exceeded the growth rate of laser printer revenue due to unit growth in lower priced desktop color and monochrome laser printers and unit price reductions 
additionally  color and multifunction laser printer units represent a more significant component of laser unit growth 
management believes these trends will continue 
this pricing pressure is partially offset by the tendency of customers in the shared workgroup laser market to add higher profit margin optional features 
pricing pressure is also partially offset by the opportunity to provide business solutions and services to customers 
in the inkjet product market  advances in inkjet technology have resulted in products with higher resolution and improved performance while increased competition has led to lower prices 
additionally  the number of consumers seeking to print in their homes digitally captured images has driven significant growth in the photo printer and aio products 
key factors promoting this trend are greater affordability of photo products along with improvements in photo printing  including the print speed  quality and print permanence 
growth in inkjet product revenue in recent years has been slower than unit growth due to price reductions 
management expects these trends to continue 
while profit margins on printers and multifunction products have been negatively affected by competitive pricing pressure  supplies sales are higher margin and recurring  which the company expects to contribute to the stability of its earnings over time 
however  as the hardcopy industry matures and printer and copier markets converge  management expects competitive pressures to negatively impact pricing and industry margins 
management saw evidence of this increasing pressure on industry margins particularly in the second half of the company s dot matrix printers and other office imaging products include many mature products such as supplies for ibm branded printers  aftermarket supplies for certain competitors products and typewriter supplies that require little ongoing investment 
the company expects that the market for these products will continue to decline  and has implemented a strategy to continue to offer high quality products while managing cost to maximize cash flow and profit 

table of contents challenges and risks in recent years  the company and its principal competitors  many of which have significantly greater financial  marketing and or technological resources than lexmark  have regularly lowered prices on printers and are expected to continue to do so 
other challenges and risks faced by the company include new product announcements by the company s principal competitors can have  and in the past  have had  a material adverse effect on the company s financial results 
with the convergence of traditional printer and copier markets  major laser competitors now include traditional copier companies 
the company must compete with its larger competitors for retail shelf space allocated to printers and their associated supplies 
the company sees the possibility of new entrants into the market which could also impact the company s growth and market share 
there can be no assurance that other companies will not develop new compatible cartridges for lexmark products 
in addition  refill and remanufactured alternatives for some of the company s cartridges are available and compete with the company s supplies business 
the company expects that as it competes with larger competitors  the company s increased market presence may attract more frequent challenges  both legal and commercial  from its competitors  including claims of possible intellectual property infringement 
the market for other office imaging products is also highly competitive and the impact printing sector of the supplies market is declining 
refer to the section entitled competition in item  which is incorporated herein by reference  for a further discussion of major uncertainties faced by the industry and company 
additionally  refer to the section entitled risk factors in item a  which is incorporated herein by reference  for a further discussion of factors that could impact the company s operating results 
strategy and initiatives lexmark s strategy is based on a business model of building an installed base of printers and multifunction products that generate demand for its related supplies and services 
management believes that lexmark has the following strengths related to this business model lexmark is exclusively focused on distributed home and office network or desktop computer printing and related solutions  lexmark internally develops all three of the key technologies in the distributed printing business  including inkjet  monochrome laser and color laser  and lexmark has leveraged its technological capabilities and its commitment to flexibility and responsiveness to build strong relationships with large account customers and channel partners 
lexmark s strategy involves the following initiatives expand the number and the penetration of the product segments in which the company participates 
lexmark is focused on increasing its participation in a number of growth segments such as color laser  laser multifunction products  business inkjet and photo inkjets 
expand the penetration of the market segments in which it participates 
lexmark is driving to expand the company s presence in its enterprise  small and medium business smb and consumer market segments through its solutions efforts and working with channel partners 
the company also continues to pursue incremental business through its alliance partners 

table of contents continue to develop lexmark s brand awareness and brand positioning 
to drive these improvements  lexmark launched its uncomplicate advertising campaign in the fourth quarter of and has continued this advertising through in addition to investments in the lexmark brand  the successful execution of this strategy involves increased investment in product and solution development 
the company increased its research and development spending by in and by in this investment has led to new products and solutions aimed at targeted growth segments as well as a pipeline of future products 
the company s strategy for dot matrix printers and other office imaging products is to continue to offer high quality products while managing cost to maximize cash flow and profit 
refer to the section entitled strategy in item  which is incorporated herein by reference  for a further discussion of the company s strategies and initiatives 
critical accounting policies and estimates lexmark s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to customer programs and incentives  product returns  doubtful accounts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  copyright fees  product royalty obligations  restructurings  pension and other postretirement benefits  and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company records estimated reductions to revenue at the time of sale for customer programs and incentive offerings including special pricing agreements  promotions and other volume based incentives 
estimated reductions in revenue are based upon historical trends and other known factors at the time of sale 
the company also provides price protection to substantially all of its distributor and reseller customers 
the amount of price protection is limited based on the amount of dealers and resellers inventory on hand including in transit inventory as of the date of the price change 
the company records a reserve for price protection as soon as the price change is probable based on estimated dealer and reseller inventories 
the company deems a price reduction to be probable if a decision has been made to take an action and the effective date is within days 
additionally  an allowance for price protection for sales between the date the change is probable and the effective date of the price change is recorded at the time of sale 
if market conditions were to decline  the company may take actions to increase customer incentive offerings  possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered 
allowances for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the company estimates the allowance for doubtful accounts based on a variety of factors including the length of time receivables are past due  the financial health of customers  unusual macroeconomic conditions and historical experience 
if the financial 
table of contents condition of the company s customers deteriorates or other circumstances occur that result in an impairment of customers ability to make payments  the company records additional allowances as needed 
warranty reserves the company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
the reserve for product warranties is based on the quantity of units sold under warranty  estimated product failure rates  and material usage and service delivery costs 
the estimates for product failure rates and material usage and service delivery costs are periodically adjusted based on actual results 
to minimize warranty costs  the company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from the company s estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability may be required 
inventory reserves and adverse purchase commitments the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value 
the company estimates the difference between the cost of obsolete or unmarketable inventory and its market value based upon product demand requirements  product life cycle  product pricing and quality issues 
also  the company records an adverse purchase commitment liability when anticipated market sales prices are lower than committed costs 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs and adverse purchase commitment liabilities may be required 
long lived assets management considers the potential impairment of both tangible and intangible assets when circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
an asset impairment review estimates the fair value of an asset based upon the future cash flows that the asset is expected to generate 
such an impairment review incorporates estimates of forecasted revenue and costs that may be associated with an asset  expected periods that an asset may be utilized and appropriate discount rates 
pension and other postretirement plans the company s pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent on various actuarial assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
significant assumptions the company must make related to its pension and other postretirement benefit obligations are expected long term return on plan assets based on long term historical actual asset return information  the mix of investments that comprise plan assets and future estimates of long term investment returns by reference to external sources 
this assumption is reviewed and set annually at the beginning of each year 
discount rate reflects the rates at which pension benefits could effectively be settled and is based on current investment yields of high quality fixed income investments 
effective december   the company began using a yield curve approach to reduce the difference in duration between the bond rates used to set the discount rate and the cash flows of the expected future benefit payments 
the yield curve approach did not have a material impact on current period operating results and is not expected to have a material impact on future operating results 
rate of compensation increase based on the company s long term plans for such increases 
differences between actual and expected asset returns on equity investments are recognized in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost over five years 
the deferred amounts resulting from this averaging process are not expected to have a significant effect on the company s results of operations for 
table of contents actual results that differ from assumptions that fall outside the corridor  as defined by sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  are accumulated and amortized over the estimated future service period of the plan participants 
for  a basis point change in the assumptions for asset return  discount rate and compensation increases  would not have had a significant impact on the net periodic benefit cost 
changes in actual asset return experience and discount rate assumptions can impact the company s stockholders equity if a plan s assets are less than a plan s accumulated benefit obligation abo at the measurement date december 
the abo is the present value of benefits earned to date and is based upon past compensation levels 
the company is required to show in its consolidated statements of financial position a net liability that is at least equal to the abo less the market value of plan assets 
this liability is referred to as an additional minimum liability aml 
an aml  which is recorded and updated on december each year  is reflected as a long term pension liability with the offset in other comprehensive earnings loss in the equity section of the consolidated statements of financial position on a net of tax basis and or as an intangible asset to the degree the company has unrecognized prior service costs 
income taxes the company estimates its tax liability based on current tax laws in the statutory jurisdictions in which it operates 
these estimates include judgments about deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from temporary differences between assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting purposes and such amounts recognized for tax purposes  as well as about the realization of deferred tax assets 
if the provisions for current or deferred taxes are not adequate  if the company is unable to realize certain deferred tax assets or if the tax laws change unfavorably  the company could potentially experience significant losses in excess of the reserves established 
likewise  if the provisions for current and deferred taxes are in excess of those eventually needed  if the company is able to realize additional deferred tax assets or if tax laws change favorably  the company could potentially experience significant gains 
results of operations summary market conditions continued to be challenging during during  the consumer market segment continued to be impacted by aggressive price competition and promotional activities  and softer than expected supplies sales 
in the business market segment  the company was impacted by mix changes to low end monochrome laser printers and price declines  as well as softer than expected supplies sales 
inkjet and laser hardware aur  which reflects the changes in both pricing and mix  was down approximately and  respectively 
additionally  supplies revenue increased in compared to the prior year and increased in compared to the prior year 
the company believes the decrease in supplies revenue growth compared to the prior year was due to yty channel inventory changes in both laser and inkjet supplies and due to weakness in end user demand  particularly in the second half of notwithstanding these impacts  management believes that end user demand for laser supplies continues to grow yty 
however  in the inkjet market  management projects an on going decline in growth rate in end user demand for supplies due to weak sales of branded hardware over the last months  the company s announced change in inkjet sales as discussed below  and the slowing growth rate the company is now experiencing in oem sales 
management expects to see additional negative yty impacts in the first quarter of in the first quarter of  management expects supplies revenue to be about flat versus last year 

table of contents to improve profitability and the company s cost and expense structure  the company announced two action plans in january first  the company is implementing a more rigorous process to improve lifetime profitability and payback on inkjet sales 
a major impact of this change will be a significant reduction in low end single function bundle inkjet sales of both branded and oem products 
this change is expected to result in a higher mix of aios  stand alone sales and more profitable sales channels 
second  the company announced a restructuring plan to improve its costs and expense structure 
the company will be consolidating manufacturing capacity in its supplies facilities which will include the closure of its rosyth  scotland inkjet manufacturing facility 
the company will also reduce its costs and expenses in the areas of supply chain  general and administrative expense  as well as marketing and sales support functions 
the company also plans to freeze its us pension plan in april  and enhance its corporate k contribution 
in total  the restructuring will eliminate or transfer about  positions overall  with approximately positions being eliminated  and about positions being transferred to low cost countries 
management projects the costs of implementing these actions to approximate million in  of which approximately million will be cash expense 
the restructuring plan is expected to save approximately million in and million per year thereafter 
in addition to the restructuring costs expected to be incurred in  the company also expects the adoption of sfas r will have a material impact on its results of operations and earnings per share

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk sensitivity the market risk inherent in the company s financial instruments and positions represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rates at december   the fair value of the company s senior notes was estimated at million using quoted market prices and yields obtained through independent pricing sources for the same or similar types of borrowing arrangements  taking into consideration the underlying terms of the debt 
the fair value of the senior notes exceeded the carrying value as recorded in the consolidated statements of financial position at december   by approximately million 
market risk is estimated as the potential change in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in interest rates and amounts to approximately million at december  the company has interest rate swaps that serve as a fair value hedge of the company s senior notes 
the fair value of the interest rate swaps at december   was a liability of million 
market risk for the interest rate swaps is estimated as the potential change in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in interest rates and amounts to approximately million at december  foreign currency exchange rates the company employs a foreign currency hedging strategy to limit potential losses in earnings or cash flows from adverse foreign currency exchange rate movements 
foreign currency exposures arise from transactions denominated in a currency other than the company s functional currency and from foreign denominated revenue and profit translated into us dollars 
the primary currencies to which the company is exposed include the euro  the mexican peso  the canadian dollar  the japanese yen  the british pound  the australian dollar and other asian and south american currencies 
exposures are hedged with foreign currency forward contracts  put options  and call options generally with maturity dates of less than eighteen months

this loss would be mitigated by corresponding gains on the underlying exposures
