item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview generation of revenue  income and cash our automotive sector s revenue  income and cash are generated primarily from sales of vehicles to our dealers and distributors ie  our customers 
vehicles we produce generally are subject to firm orders from our customers and generally are deemed sold with the proceeds from such sale recognized in revenue immediately after they are produced and shipped to our customers 
this is not the case  however  with respect to vehicles produced for sale to daily rental car companies that are subject to a guaranteed repurchase option or vehicles produced for use in our own fleet including management evaluation vehicles 
vehicles sold to daily rental car companies that are subject to a guaranteed repurchase option are accounted for as operating leases  with lease revenue and profits recognized over the term of the lease 
when we sell the vehicle at auction  we recognize a gain or loss on the difference  if any  between actual auction value and the projected auction value 
therefore  except for the impact of the daily rental units sold subject to a guaranteed repurchase option and those units placed into our own fleet  vehicle production is closely linked with unit sales and revenue from such sales 
most of the vehicles sold by us to our dealers and distributors are financed at wholesale by ford credit 
upon ford credit originating the wholesale receivable related to a dealer s purchase of a vehicle  ford credit pays cash to the relevant legal entity in our automotive sector in payment of the dealer s obligation for the purchase price of the vehicle 
the dealer then pays off the wholesale finance receivable when it sells the vehicle to a retail customer 
our financial services sector s revenue is generated primarily from interest on finance receivables  net of certain deferred origination costs that are included as a reduction of financing revenue  and such revenue is recognized over the term of the receivable using the interest method 
also  revenue from operating leases  net of certain deferred origination costs  is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the lease 
income is generated to the extent revenues exceed expenses  most of which are interest and operating expenses 
transactions between the automotive and financial services sectors occur in the ordinary course of business 
for example  ford credit receives interest supplements and other support cost payments from the automotive sector in connection with special vehicle financing and leasing programs that it sponsors 
ford credit records these payments as revenue  and the automotive sector makes the related cash payments  over the term of the related finance receivable or operating lease 
the automotive sector records the estimated costs of marketing incentives  including dealer and retail customer cash payments eg  rebates and costs of special financing and leasing programs  as a reduction to revenue at the later of the date the related vehicle sales are recorded or at the date the incentive program is both approved and communicated 
see note of the notes to financial statements for a more detailed discussion of transactions and payments between the automotive and financial services sectors 
key economic factors and trends affecting the automotive industry excess capacity 
according to csm worldwide  an automotive research firm  in the estimated automotive industry global production capacity for light vehicles about million units significantly exceeded global production of cars and trucks about million units 
in north america and europe  the two regions where the majority of revenue and profits are earned in the industry  excess capacity was an estimated and  respectively 
according to production capacity data projected by csm worldwide  excess capacity conditions in north america could continue for several more years  but would be mitigated by the capacity reductions announced by us and general motors corporation when these planned reductions are completed 
pricing pressure 
excess capacity  coupled with a proliferation of new products being introduced in key segments by the industry  will keep pressure on manufacturers ability to increase prices on their products 
in addition  the incremental new us manufacturing capacity of foreign manufacturers so called transplants in recent years has contributed  and is likely to continue to contribute  to the severe pricing pressure in that market 
for example  in  toyota motor corporation is expected to complete construction of an assembly plant in texas that reportedly will be capable of producing at least  full size pick up trucks per year 
the reduction of real prices for similarly contented vehicles in the united states has become more pronounced since the late s  and we expect that a challenging pricing environment will continue for some time to come 
in europe  the automotive industry also has experienced intense pricing pressure for several years for the same reasons discussed above  exacerbated in recent years by the block exemption regulation discussed above in item business automotive sector 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued consumer spending trends 
we expect  however  that a decline in or the inability to increase vehicle prices could be offset by the spending habits of consumers and their propensity to purchase over time higher end  more expensive vehicles and or vehicles with more features 
over the next decade  in the united states and other mature markets  we expect that growth in spending on vehicle mix and content will change generally in line with gdp 
the benefits of this to revenue growth in the automotive industry are significant 
in the united states  for example  consumers in the highest income bracket are buying more often and are more frequently buying upscale 
although growth in vehicle unit sales ie  volume will be greatest in emerging markets in the next decade  we expect that the mature automotive markets eg  north america  western europe  and japan will continue to be the source of a majority of global industry revenues 
we also expect that the north american market will continue as the single largest source of revenue for the automotive industry in the world 
health care expenses 
in  our health care expenses for us employees  retirees  and their dependents were billion  with about billion for postretirement health care and the balance for active employee health care 
in  prescription drugs continued to represent approximately one third of our total health care expense 
although we have taken measures to have employees and retirees bear a higher portion of the costs of their health care benefits  we expect our health care costs to continue to increase 
for  our trend assumptions for us health care costs include an initial trend rate of  gradually declining to a steady state trend rate of reached in these assumptions include the effect of actions we are taking and expect to take to offset health care inflation  including eligibility management  employee education and wellness programs  competitive sourcing  and appropriate employee cost sharing 
commodity and energy price increases 
commodity price increases  particularly for steel and resins which are our two largest commodity exposures and among the most difficult to hedge  have occurred recently and are continuing during a period of strong global demand for these materials 
in addition  energy prices increased significantly in in particular  gasoline prices in the united states increased in volatility and rose to levels well over per gallon in  and have remained at levels significantly higher than this has had an adverse effect on the demand for full and medium sized sport utility vehicles in the united states 
currency exchange rate volatility 
the us dollar has depreciated against most major currencies since this created downward margin pressure on auto manufacturers that have us dollar revenue with foreign currency cost 
because we produce vehicles in europe eg  jaguar  land rover and volvo models for sale in the united states and produce components in europe eg  engines for use in some of our north american vehicles  we experienced margin pressure 
although this pressure was offset partially by gains on foreign exchange derivatives  this offset reduces over time due to the expiration of favorable hedges previously put in place 
we  like many other automotive manufacturers with sales in the united states  are not always able to price for depreciation of the us dollar due to the extremely competitive pricing environment in the united states 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued trends and strategies the way forward plan the global automotive marketplace has become increasingly fragmented and crowded  and we anticipate that this trend will accelerate into the future 
anticipating little growth in the overall volume of vehicles sold in north america for the foreseeable future  we expect more manufacturers to offer an increasing number of products 
presently  there are about different nameplates being offered in the united states  compared with in and a projected or more by in order to stabilize and grow our us market share in this increasingly competitive environment and generally improve our business  we are implementing a business improvement plan for our north american automotive operations that we refer to as our way forward plan 
this plan focuses on the following key areas renewed customer focus and brand differentiation  commitment to innovation  clear pricing  and cost reductions 
customer focus and brand differentiation to compete more effectively in today s global marketplace  a sharpened customer focus is essential 
toward that end  we have developed a new customer segmentation model using a proprietary large scale quantitative survey to better understand the values and attitudes in the us marketplace 
this model focuses on values and attitudes that drive purchase behaviors and that cross traditional demographic lines of age  lifestage  gender and cultural identity 
using this new segmentation model  we selected target customer segments for our ford  lincoln  and mercury brands 
these target customer segments will provide a sharper focus for our business  and we will use this focus to ensure all aspects of our business will be aligned to satisfy our customers current needs and anticipate their future needs 
to effectively leverage our global resources  we must focus on differentiating our brand identities  especially within the crowded north american marketplace 
going forward  we intend to have clear and distinct identities for our brands 
our ford brand in the united states stands for bold american design that exudes strength and progress  a number of our products already reflect that design philosophy  including our award winning mustang  f series  and fusion models 
we plan to continue this brand philosophy in future ford brand models  such as the new ford edge crossover vehicle 
mercury appeals to consumers with different values and attitudes  and brings conquest purchasers to us 
our strategy for the mercury brand is to create vehicles that offer modern  expressive design for the american consumer  while maintaining common product functionality with the ford brand 
the mercury mariner and mercury milan are examples of products delivering the intended brand identity and product functionality 
our strategy for lincoln is to appeal to self made american consumers who are achieving their dreams  by offering these consumers refined and dynamic vehicle design  smooth power on demand  and a personalized environment 
the lincoln zephyr and lincoln navigator are examples of products delivering this brand identity today  and this brand philosophy will be continued in future products  such as the new lincoln mkx crossover vehicle 
innovation initiative to continue delivering the cutting edge technology consumers desire  we also are rededicating ourselves to driving innovation through our entire business  beginning with the way we analyze the marketplace  develop and produce products  and continuing through the sales and service channels 
our innovation initiative demands creative and original thinking  implemented through a disciplined process  throughout our global operations  which we can then maximize through global synergies in order to create more new products and features  more flexible plants  more common processes and economies of scale to deliver more new product faster to all of our markets and for all of our brands 
our strategy is to differentiate ourselves in the marketplace through design innovation  safety innovation  and new environmentally friendly technologies 
clear pricing we began introducing clear  simple pricing two years ago with the introduction of the new mustang  and have continued this strategy with new models such as the ford fusion  mercury milan and lincoln zephyr 
these vehicles are proving that well priced products with great appeal can reduce our reliance on incentives 
our plan is to extend this strategy to all of our vehicles over time 
this is a key component of communicating our brand philosophy to our customers through bold styling and clear  simple pricing 
ford will continue this approach of bringing sticker prices in line with actual transaction prices by reducing rebates over time as we introduce new models into the marketplace 
our customers will benefit from a simpler purchase experience and improved residual values and cost of ownership 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued cost savings to improve our business and profitability  we plan to reduce our costs through material cost actions  health care cost reductions  and capacity and personnel reductions 
material cost actions 
during  we announced an initiative to enter into new long term agreements with select strategic suppliers globally in order to strengthen collaboration and develop a sustainable business model to drive mutual profitability and technology development 
this new aligned business framework is expected to establish closer relationships with a smaller number of suppliers  reducing by approximately percent the number of suppliers to whom we source new business for high impact component systems 
these systems  including seats  wiring  restraint systems  and instrument and trim panels  represent about half of our annual production purchases globally 
in addition  we have established cross functional component systems teams with common objectives and processes to establish component systems business plans with the goal of further reducing material costs 
with these actions  we are targeting net material cost reductions excluding special items of at least billion by at constant volume  mix and exchange  net of new product content and regulatory changes 
as disclosed in our current report on form k dated october   we also finalized an agreement with visteon corporation visteon  our largest supplier  in which we assumed control of plants and six other facilities in the united states and mexico 
these assets were transferred to automotive components holdings  llc ach  a temporary business controlled and managed by us  to protect the flow of critical parts and components in the near term and  over time  to improve our sourcing flexibility and cost competitiveness 
ach s mission is to prepare most of the acquired businesses for sale to companies with the capital and expertise to supply us with high quality components and systems at competitive prices 
as we prepare these businesses for sale  we also are taking actions to reduce hourly employment at ach by approximately  positions  primarily through buyouts 
health care cost reductions 
effective january  for us salaried employees hired before june   we established a company contribution limit set at levels for retiree health care benefits us salaried employees hired on or after june  participate in a defined contribution retiree health care plan 
in addition  for us salaried employees hired before january  who retire on or after june   company paid retiree life insurance benefits are limited to  employees hired on or after january  do not receive company paid retiree life insurance benefits 
these benefit changes resulted in a decrease in the year end other postretirement employee benefit opeb obligation of about billion and a reduction in and ongoing expense of about million annually 
the related cash savings will grow over time 
in december  we reached an agreement with the uaw that would increase retiree health care cost sharing 
as part of the agreement  an independent defined contribution voluntary employee benefit association trust would be established for the purpose of mitigating the financial impact of increased cost sharing to retirees 
this trust would be funded primarily through i wage diversions from active hourly employees  ii specified cash contributions aggregating million to be made by us over several years  and iii potential cash contributions to be made by us based on any price appreciation above per share of a notional amount of  shares of ford common stock 
the agreement is subject to court approval of a proposed settlement of a purported class action challenging our decision to modify the retiree health care plan  additional retirees have expressed their objection to the agreement by moving to intervene in the pending lawsuit and filing a follow on suit of their own 
if the settlement of the purported class action receives court approval  the agreement is expected to reduce our opeb obligation by about billion  with projected average annual cost savings of about million and reduced average annual cash outlays of about million 
capacity and personnel reductions 
our north american operations presently have the capacity to support a us market share significantly in excess of the share our ford  lincoln  and mercury brands achieved in as a result  our plant utilization rate in north america has been about  which is not sustainable 
given the continued proliferation of new model offerings by current and potential participants in the us automotive market  we recognize the need to match our north american production capacity to realistic volume and market share expectations 
accordingly  we plan to idle and cease operations at manufacturing facilities in north america by  including seven vehicle assembly plants 
associated with these plant idlings  we intend to reduce our manufacturing employment by  to  people during the same period 
these personnel reductions do not include actions at ach  and are in addition to the previously announced reduction of the equivalent of  salaried positions by the end of the first quarter of  as well as a reduction in our officer ranks by percent by the end of the first quarter of the first facility to be idled pursuant to the way forward plan will be our st 
louis assembly plant  which is targeted to cease production by the end of the first quarter of further  we have announced plans to idle the following facilities through atlanta assembly plant  wixom assembly plant  batavia transmission plant  windsor casting plant  and two additional assembly plants to be determined later this year 
in addition  production at our st 
thomas assembly plant will be reduced to one shift 
these item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued actions should reduce our north american assembly capacity by million units or and help improve our assembly capacity utilization rate

includes managed receivables and receivables sold in whole loan sale transactions where ford credit retains no interest in the sold receivables  but which it continues to service 
ford credit analyzes its financial performance primarily on an on balance sheet and managed basis 
it retains interests in receivables sold in off balance sheet securitizations and  with respect to subordinated retained interests  has credit risk 
as a result  it evaluates credit losses  receivables and leverage on a managed basis as well as on an on balance sheet basis 
in contrast  ford credit does not have the same financial interest in the performance of receivables sold in whole loan sale transactions  and as a result  ford credit generally reviews the performance of its serviced portfolio only to evaluate the effectiveness of its origination and collection activities 
to evaluate the performance of these activities  ford credit monitors a number of measures  such as repossession statistics  losses on repossessions and the number of bankruptcy filings

on balance sheet receivables 
on balance sheet receivables decreased from year end primarily reflecting lower retail contract placement volumes 
the decrease was largely offset by the accounting consolidation of ford credit s off balance sheet wholesale securitization program as a result of certain changes made to the program in the fourth quarter of  which caused the receivables previously sold by ford credit to this program to be reported on balance sheet

liquidity and capital resources automotive sector our strategy is to ensure we have sufficient funding available with a high degree of certainty throughout the business cycle 
the key elements of this strategy include maintaining large gross cash balances  generating cash from operating related activities  having a long dated debt maturity profile  maintaining committed credit facilities and funding long term liabilities over time 
gross cash 
automotive gross cash includes cash and cash equivalents  marketable and loaned securities and assets contained in a short term voluntary employee beneficiary association trust veba  a trust which may be used to pre fund certain types of company paid benefits for us employees and retirees

in managing our business  we classify changes in automotive gross cash into two categories operating related and other which primarily includes pension and long term veba contributions  tax refunds  capital transactions with the financial services sector  and acquisitions and divestitures 
our key metric is operating related cash flow  which best represents the ability of our automotive item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued operations to generate cash 
we believe the cash flow analysis reflected in the table below  which differs from a cash flow statement presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states us gaap  is useful to investors because it includes cash flow elements that we consider to be related to our operating activities eg  capital spending that are not included in net cash flows from operating activities  the most directly comparable us gaap financial measure

financial services sector ford credit ford credit s funding strategy is to maintain liquidity and access to diverse funding sources that are cost effective 
as a result of lower credit ratings  ford credit s unsecured borrowing costs have increased  its access to the unsecured debt market has become more restricted  and its outstanding short and long term unsecured debt balances have declined 
in response  ford credit has increased its use of securitization and other asset related sources of liquidity  and will continue to expand and diversify its asset backed funding by asset class  region and channel 
in addition  ford credit will continue to participate in the whole loan market and access the unsecured term debt market opportunistically 
over time  ford credit may also need to reduce further the amount of receivables it purchases 
a significant reduction in the amount of purchased receivables would significantly reduce ford credit s ongoing profits  and could adversely affect its ability to support the sale of our vehicles 
debt and cash 
ford credit s total debt was billion at december   down billion compared with a year ago  primarily reflecting repayment of maturing debt and lower funding requirements due to lower asset levels 
ford credit s outstanding unsecured commercial paper at december  totaled billion  down billion compared with a year ago  reflecting decreased investor demand 
at december   ford credit had cash and cash equivalents of billion  compared with billion at year end in the normal course of its funding activities  ford credit may generate more proceeds than are necessary for its immediate funding needs 
these excess amounts are maintained primarily as highly liquid investments  which provide liquidity for ford credit s short term funding needs and give ford credit flexibility in the use of its other funding programs 
funding 
ford credit requires substantial funding in the normal course of business 
ford credit s funding requirements are driven mainly by the need to i purchase retail installment sale contracts and retail lease contracts to support the sale of ford products  which are influenced by ford sponsored special financing programs that are available exclusively through ford credit  ii provide wholesale financing and capital financing for ford dealers  and iii repay its debt obligations 
ford credit s funding sources include sales of receivables in securitizations and other structured financings  unsecured debt issuances and bank borrowings 
unsecured debt issuance consists of short and long term unsecured debt  placed directly by ford credit or through securities dealers or underwriters in us and international capital markets  and reaches both retail and institutional investors 
during  ford credit continued to meet a significant portion of its funding requirements through securitizations because of their lower relative costs given our credit ratings as described below  the stability of the market for asset backed securities  and the item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued diversity of funding sources that they provide 
securitized funding both on and off balance sheet  net of retained interests as a percent of total managed receivables was as follows at the end of each of the last three years   
ford credit issues unsecured commercial paper in the united states  europe and other international markets  with sales mostly to qualified institutional investors 
in addition to its commercial paper programs  ford credit also obtains short term funding from the sale of floating rate demand notes under a program referred to as ford interest advantage  and such notes may be redeemed at any time at the option of the holder thereof without restriction 
at december   the principal amount outstanding of such notes was billion 
ford credit does not hold reserves to fund the payment of the demand notes or any other short term funding obligation 
ford credit s policy is to have sufficient cash and cash equivalents  unused committed bank sponsored asset backed commercial paper issuer conduit capacity  securitizable assets  and back up credit facilities to provide liquidity for all of its short term funding obligations 
the following table illustrates ford credit s term public funding issuances for and and its planned issuances for in billions forecast unsecured term debt institutional retail total unsecured term debt term public securitization a total term public funding memo not included above private transactions b a reflects new issuance and includes funding from discontinued operations in  excludes whole loan sales and other structured financings 
b includes private securitizations  other structured financings and whole loan sales  excludes sales to ford credit s on balance sheet asset backed commercial paper programs and proceeds from revolving transactions 
the cost of both debt and funding in securitizations is based on a margin or spread over a benchmark interest rate  such as interest rates paid on us treasury securities of similar maturities 
ford credit s unsecured spreads have been very volatile over the last three years  as a result of market perception and its lower credit ratings  whereas its securitized funding spreads which are based on the underlying finance receivables and credit enhancements have not 
in  ford credit s unsecured long term debt funding spreads fluctuated between and basis points above comparable us treasury securities  while its spreads on securitized funding fluctuated between and basis points above comparable us treasury securities 
ford credit has a program to sell retail installment sale contracts in transactions where it retains no interest and thus no exposure to the sold assets 
these transactions  referred to as whole loan sale transactions  provide liquidity by enabling ford credit to reduce its managed receivables and its need for funding to support those receivables 
in  ford credit sold billion of receivables in a whole loan sale transaction 
total outstanding receivables sold in whole loan sale transactions at december  were billion 
for additional funding and to maintain liquidity  ford credit and its majority owned subsidiaries  including fce bank plc fce  have contractually committed credit facilities with financial institutions that totaled billion at december   of which billion were available for use 
of the lines available for use  are committed through june  of the billion  billion constitute ford credit facilities billion global and about million non global and billion constitute fce facilities billion global and about million non global 
in addition  at december   banks provided billion of contractually committed liquidity facilities exclusively to support ford credit s two on balance sheet asset backed commercial paper programs  billion supported ford credit s fcar retail program and million supported ford credit s wholesale securitization program motown notes 
ford credit also has entered into agreements with several bank sponsored conduits under which such conduits are contractually committed to purchase from ford credit  at ford credit s option  retail receivables for proceeds of up to approximately billion 
at december   billion of these conduit commitments were in use 
for further discussion of these facilities and agreements  see note of the notes to the financial statements 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued leverage 
ford credit uses leverage  or the debt to equity ratio  to make various business decisions  including establishing pricing for retail  wholesale and lease financing and assessing its capital structure 
ford credit calculates leverage on a financial statement basis and on a managed basis using the following formulas financial statement leverage total debt equity total debt securitized off balance sheet receivables retained interest in securitized off balance sheet receivables cash and cash equivalents fair value hedge accounting adjustments on total debt managed leverage equity minority interest fair value hedge accounting adjustments on equity the following table illustrates the calculation of ford credit s financial statement leverage in billions  except for ratios december  total debt total stockholder s equity debt to equity ratio to the following table illustrates the calculation of ford credit s managed leverage in billions  except for ratios december  total debt securitized off balance sheet receivables outstanding a retained interest in securitized off balance sheet receivables b adjustments for cash and cash equivalents fair value hedge accounting adjustments total adjusted debt total stockholder s equity including minority interest fair value hedge accounting adjustments total adjusted equity managed debt to equity ratio to a includes securitized funding from discontinued operations in and b includes retained interest in securitized receivables from discontinued operations in and ford credit believes that managed leverage is useful to its investors because it reflects the way ford credit manages its business 
ford credit retains interests in receivables sold in off balance sheet securitization transactions and  with respect to subordinated retained interests  is exposed to credit risk 
accordingly  ford credit considers securitization as an alternative source of funding and evaluates charge offs  receivables and leverage on a managed as well as a financial statement basis 
ford credit also deducts cash and cash equivalents because they generally correspond to excess debt beyond the amount required to support its operations 
in addition  ford credit adds its minority interests to its financial statement equity because all of the debt of such consolidated entities is included in its total debt 
ford credit makes fair value hedge accounting adjustments to its assets  debt and equity positions to reflect the impact of interest rate instruments ford credit uses in connection with its term debt issuances and securitizations 
the fair value hedge accounting adjustments vary over the term of the underlying debt and securitized funding obligations based on changes in market interest rates 
ford credit generally repays its debt obligations as they mature 
as a result  ford credit excludes the impact of the fair value hedge accounting adjustments on both the numerator and denominator in order to exclude the interim effects of changes in market interest rates 
accordingly  the managed leverage measure provides ford credit s investors with meaningful information regarding management s decision making processes 
ford credit s managed leverage strategy involves establishing a leverage level that takes into consideration prevailing market conditions and reflects the risk characteristics of its business 
at december   ford credit s managed leverage was to  compared with to a year ago 
ford credit plans to continue to reduce its managed leverage in in  ford credit paid cash dividends of billion 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued total company stockholders equity 
our stockholders equity was billion at december   down billion compared with december  the decrease primarily reflected foreign currency translation adjustments  net losses on derivative instruments  and cash dividends  offset partially by net income 
for additional discussion of foreign currency translation adjustments and derivative instruments  see notes and  respectively  of the notes to the financial statements 
credit ratings 
our short and long term debt is rated by four credit rating agencies designated as nationally recognized statistical rating organizations nrsros by the securities and exchange commission dominion bond rating service limited dbrs  fitch  inc fitch  moody s investors service  inc moody s  and standard poor s rating services  a division of mcgraw hill companies  inc s p 
in several markets  locally recognized rating agencies also rate us 
a credit rating reflects an assessment by the rating agency of the credit risk associated with particular securities we issue  based on information provided by us and other sources 
credit ratings are not recommendations to buy  sell or hold securities and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency 
each rating agency may have different criteria for evaluating company risk  and therefore ratings should be evaluated independently for each rating agency 
lower credit ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to capital markets 
the nrsros have indicated that our lower ratings are primarily a reflection of the rating agencies concerns regarding our automotive cash flow and profitability  declining market share  excess industry capacity  industry pricing pressure and rising health care costs

automotive cost performance 
we expect commodity costs to continue to increase in we also expect depreciation and amortization expenses to increase in compared with  primarily because capacity reduction actions pursuant to our way forward plan will result in accelerated depreciation of assets at certain manufacturing facilities 
we expect our quality related costs in to be about the same as in  although we expect favorable performance in our vehicle quality  we will not have the recurrence of the favorable impact of a million settlement reached in with bridgestone firestone north american tire  llc 
pension and opeb expenses in also are expected to be about the same as last year  with the modifications to retiree health care programs discussed above under overview offsetting the impact of these expenses for our employees previously assigned to visteon  as well as lower discount rates and lower assumed rates of return 
manufacturing  engineering and overhead costs are expected to be lower in  reflecting personnel reductions and other efficiencies 
product costs are expected to be favorable in compared with  as we begin to see the benefits of the material cost reduction plan discussed above under overview 
overall  excluding special items and at constant volume  mix  and exchange  we expect our cost performance to be favorable in  compared with automotive results 
our automotive operations in north america are projected to post a pre tax loss in however  subject to the risks described below  we expect these operations to be profitable no later than  although the progression to profitability will not necessarily be linear or smooth 
subject to the risks described below  we expect each of our other automotive business units to be profitable on a pre tax basis in overall  we expect our total automotive operations to be unprofitable in due to the expected performance of our north american operations 
these expected results include certain pre tax charges ie  special items of about billion that we anticipate in these charges will include the costs associated with the way forward plan through  which are estimated to include pre tax charges and cash expenditures of million for hourly personnel reductions  and pre tax charges primarily non cash of million for fixed asset write offs 
the remainder of these charges relates to personnel reduction actions in europe and  to a lesser extent  at our ach operations 
in addition  in connection with the way forward plan  we are reviewing costs relating to the guaranteed employment numbers gen provision of our collective bargaining agreement with the uaw 
under this gen provision  we are required to pay idled workers who meet certain conditions substantially all of their wages and benefits for the term of the current agreement 
heretofore  we have had relatively few employees subject to the gen provision  however  we expect the number of employees subject to the gen provision to grow in the near term as a result of the hourly personnel reduction actions that are part of the way forward plan 
we are presently assessing the appropriate accounting treatment for and amount of these gen costs  including the extent  if any  to which future gen costs should be accrued in the first quarter of financial services results 
our financial services sector is projected to be profitable in  but less profitable than in because of the absence of earnings from hertz including the gain on sale and lower expected earnings at ford credit 
for  we expect ford credit s managed receivables to decline to between billion and billion 
ford credit s earnings are expected to be lower than in because of the impact of the lower level of receivables and the impact of higher interest rates

critical accounting estimates we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made  and changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period  would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
in addition  there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation  but are not deemed critical as defined above 
changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements 
warranty and additional service actions nature of estimates required 
the estimated warranty and additional service action costs are accrued for each vehicle at the time of sale 
estimates are principally based on assumptions regarding the lifetime warranty costs of each vehicle line and each model year of that vehicle line  where little or no claims experience may exist 
in addition  the number and magnitude of additional service actions expected to be approved  and policies related to additional service actions  are taken into consideration 
due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of these estimated factors  changes in our assumptions could materially affect net income 
assumptions and approach used 
our estimate of warranty and additional service action obligations is reevaluated on a quarterly basis 
experience has shown that initial data for any given model year can be volatile  therefore  our process relies upon long term historical averages until sufficient data are available 
as actual experience becomes available  it is used to modify the historical averages to ensure that the forecast is within the range of likely outcomes 
resulting balances are then compared with present spending rates to ensure that the accruals are adequate to meet expected future obligations 
see note of the notes to the financial statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for warranties and additional service actions 
pensions nature of estimates required 
the estimation of our pension obligations  costs and liabilities requires that we make use of estimates of the present value of the projected future payments to all participants  taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as salary increases and demographic experience 
these assumptions may have an effect on the amount and timing of future contributions 
assumptions and approach used 
the assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors discount rates salary growth retirement rates expected contributions inflation expected return on plan assets mortality rates we base the discount rate assumption primarily on the results of a cash flow matching analysis  which matches the future cash outflows for each major plan to a yield curve comprised of high quality bonds specific to the country of the plan 
our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators 
the salary growth assumption reflects our long term actual experience  the near term outlook  and assumed inflation 
the expected return on plan assets assumption reflects historical plan returns and long run inputs from a range of internal and external advisors for capital market returns  inflation  bond yields  and other variables  adjusted for specific aspects of our investment strategy 
we also consider peer data in setting the expected return on asset assumption 
the expected amount and timing of contributions is based on an assessment of minimum requirements  and additional amounts based on cash availability and other considerations eg  funded status  avoidance of pension benefit guaranty corporation pbgc penalty premiums  uk pension protection fund levies  and tax efficiency 
retirement and mortality rates are developed to reflect actual and projected plan experience 
plan obligations and costs are based on existing retirement plan provisions 
no assumption is made regarding any potential future changes to benefit provisions beyond those to which we are presently committed eg  in existing labor contracts 
the effects of actual results differing from our assumptions and the effects of changing assumptions are included in unamortized net gains and losses 
unamortized gains and losses are amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect our recognized expense in future periods

other postretirement employee benefits retiree health care and life insurance nature of estimates required 
the estimation of our obligations  costs and liabilities associated with other postretirement employee benefits opeb ie  retiree health care and life insurance requires that we make use of estimates of the present value of the projected future payments to all participants  taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as health care cost increases  salary increases and demographic experience  which may have an effect on the amount and timing of future payments 
assumptions and approach used 
the assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors discount rates salary growth retirement rates expected contributions health care cost trends expected return on plan assets mortality rates our health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data  the near term outlook  anticipated efficiencies and other cost mitigation actions including eligibility management  employee education and wellness  competitive sourcing and appropriate employee cost sharing and an assessment of likely long term trends 
we base the discount rate assumption primarily on the results of a cash flow matching analysis  which matches the future cash outflows for each plan to a yield curve comprised of high quality bonds specific to the country of the plan 
the salary growth assumptions reflect our long term actual experience  the near term outlook and assumed inflation 
the expected return on plan assets assumption reflects historical plan returns and inputs from a range of internal and external advisors for capital market returns  inflation  bond yields  and other variables  adjusted for specific aspects of our investment strategy 
we also consider peer data in setting the expected return on asset assumption 
the expected amount and timing of contributions is based on an assessment of cash availability and other considerations eg  funded status and tax efficiency

health care cost trend rates total expense health care cost trend rates service and interest expense allowance for credit losses financial services sector the allowance for credit losses is ford credit s estimate of credit losses related to impaired finance receivables and operating leases at the date of the financial statements 
ford credit monitors credit loss performance monthly and assesses the adequacy of its allowance for credit losses quarterly 
because credit losses can vary substantially over time  estimating credit losses requires a number of assumptions about matters that are uncertain 
nature of estimates required 
ford credit estimates the credit losses related to impaired finance receivables and operating leases by evaluating several factors including historical credit loss trends  the credit quality of its present portfolio  trends in historical and projected used vehicle values and general economic measures 
assumptions used 
ford credit makes projections of two key assumptions frequency 
the number of finance receivables and operating lease contracts that it expects will default over a period of time  measured as repossessions  and loss severity 
the expected difference between the amount a customer owes ford credit when it charges off the finance contract and the amount it receives  net of expenses  from selling the repossessed vehicle  including any recoveries from the customer 
ford credit uses these assumptions to assist in setting its allowance for credit losses 
see note of the notes to the financial statements for more information regarding allowance for credit losses 
sensitivity analysis 
changes in the assumptions used to derive frequency and severity would affect the allowance for credit losses 
the effect of the indicated increase decrease in the assumptions is shown below for ford  lincoln and mercury brand vehicles in the united states in millions increase decrease assumption percentage point change december  allowance for credit losses expense repossession rates pt 
loss severity reflects the number of finance receivables and operating lease contracts that we expect will default over a period of time relative to the average number of contracts outstanding 
changes in our assumptions affect the provision for credit losses on our income statement and the allowance for credit losses contained within finance receivables  net on our balance sheet 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued accumulated depreciation on vehicles subject to operating leases accumulated depreciation on vehicles subject to operating leases reduces the value of the leased vehicles in our operating lease portfolio from their original acquisition value to their expected residual value at the end of the lease term 
these vehicles primarily consist of retail lease contracts for ford credit and vehicles sold to daily rental car companies subject to a guaranteed repurchase option rental repurchase vehicles for the automotive sector 
we monitor residual values each month  and we review the adequacy of our accumulated depreciation on a quarterly basis 
if we believe that the expected residual values for our vehicles have changed  we revise depreciation to ensure that our net investment in operating leases equal to our acquisition value of the vehicles minus accumulated depreciation will be adjusted to reflect our revised estimate of the expected residual value at the end of the lease term 
for retail leases  such adjustments to depreciation expense would result in a change in the depreciation rates of the vehicles subject to operating leases  and are recorded on a straight line basis 
for retail leases  each lease customer has the option to buy the leased vehicle at the end of the lease or to return the vehicle to the dealer 
if the customer returns the vehicle to the dealer  the dealer may buy the vehicle from us or return it to us 
over the last three years  about of ford credit s north america operating lease vehicles have been returned to us 
for rental repurchase vehicles  practically all vehicles are returned to us 
nature of estimates required 
for vehicles subject to operating leases  we establish an expected residual value for the vehicle 
we estimate the expected residual value by evaluating historical auction values  historical return volumes for our retail leased vehicles  industry wide used vehicle prices  our marketing plans and vehicle quality data 
assumptions used 
for retail leases  our accumulated depreciation on vehicles subject to operating leases is based on our assumptions of auction value 
the market value of the vehicles when we sell them at the end of the lease  and return volume 
the number of vehicles that will be returned to us at lease end 
see note of the notes to the financial statements for more information regarding accumulated depreciation on vehicles subject to operating leases 
sensitivity analysis 
for returned vehicles  we face a risk that the amount we obtain from the vehicle sold at auction will be less than our estimate of the expected residual value for the vehicle 
at year end  if future auction values for retail operating leases on ford  lincoln and mercury brand vehicles in the united states were to decrease by one percent from our present estimates  the impact would be to increase our depreciation on these vehicles by about million 
similarly  if return volumes for our existing portfolio of retail operating leases on ford  lincoln and mercury brand vehicles in the united states were to increase by one percent from our present estimates  the impact would be to increase our depreciation on these vehicles by about million 
these increases in depreciation would be charged to depreciation expense during the through period so that the net investment in retail operating leases at the end of the lease term for these vehicles is equal to the revised expected residual value 
adjustments to the amount of accumulated depreciation on retail operating leases will be reflected on our balance sheet in net investment in operating leases and on our income statement in depreciation  in each case under the financial services sector

some of these arrangements satisfy accounting sale treatment and are not reflected on ford credit s balance sheet in the same way as debt funding 
the remainder of these arrangements do not satisfy the requirements for accounting sale treatment and the sold receivables and associated debt are not removed from ford credit s balance sheet 
securitization involves the sale of a pool of receivables to a special purpose entity spe  typically a trust 
the spe issues interest bearing securities  commonly called asset backed securities  that are backed by the sold receivables 
the spe uses proceeds from the sale of these securities to pay the purchase price for the sold receivables 
the spe may only purchase the receivables  issue asset backed securities and make payments on the securities 
the spe has a limited duration and generally is dissolved when investors holding the asset backed securities have been paid all amounts owed to them 
ford credit s use of spes in securitizations is consistent with conventional practices in the securitization industry 
the sale to the spe achieves isolation of the sold receivables for the benefit of securitization investors and protects them from the claims of ford credit s creditors 
the use of spes combined with the structure of these transactions means that the payment of the asset backed securities is based on the creditworthiness of the underlying finance receivables and any enhancements as discussed below  and not ford credit s creditworthiness 
as a result  the senior asset backed securities issued by the spes generally receive the highest short term credit ratings and among the highest long term credit ratings from the credit rating agencies that rate them and are sold to securitization investors at cost effective pricing 
ford credit s typical us retail securitization is a two step transaction 
ford credit sells a pool of its retail installment sale contracts to a wholly owned  bankruptcy remote special purpose subsidiary that establishes a separate spe  usually a trust  and transfers the receivables to the spe in exchange for the proceeds from securities issued by the spe 
the securities issued by the trust  usually notes of various maturities and interest rates  are paid by the spe from collections on the pool of receivables it owns 
these securities are usually structured into senior and subordinated classes 
the senior classes have priority over the subordinated classes in receiving collections from the sold receivables 
the receivables acquired by the spe and the asset backed securities issued by the spe are assets and obligations of the spe 
the following simplified diagram shows ford credit s typical us retail securitization transaction sor chart ford credit selects receivables at random for its securitization transactions using selection criteria designed for the specific transaction 
for securitizations of retail installment sale contracts  the selection criteria are based on factors such as location of the obligor  contract term  payment schedule  interest rate  financing program  and the type of financed vehicle 
in general  the criteria also require receivables to be active and in good standing 
ford credit retains interests in receivables sold through securitizations 
the retained interests may include senior and subordinated securities issued by the spe  restricted cash held for the benefit of the spe for example  a reserve fund and residual interests in securitization transactions 
income from residual interests in securitization transactions represents the right to receive collections on the sold finance receivables in excess of amounts needed by the spe to pay interest and principal to investors  servicing fees and other required payments 
ford credit retains credit risk in securitizations 
ford credit s retained interests usually include the most item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued subordinated interests in the spe  which are the first to absorb credit losses on the sold receivables 
ford credit s securitizations are structured to protect the holders of the senior asset backed securities such that  based on past experience  any credit losses in the pool of sold receivables would likely be limited to ford credit s retained interests 
at december  and  the total outstanding principal amount of receivables sold by ford credit in off balance sheet securitizations was billion and billion  respectively 
at december  and  ford credit s retained interests in such sold receivables were billion and billion  respectively 
the decline primarily reflected ford credit s accounting consolidation of its off balance sheet wholesale securitization program as a result of certain changes made to the program during the fourth quarter of ford credit generally has no obligation to repurchase or replace any receivable sold to an spe that subsequently becomes delinquent in payment or otherwise is in default 
investors holding securities issued by an spe have no recourse to ford credit or its other assets for credit losses on the sold receivables and have no right to require it to repurchase the securities 
ford credit does not guarantee any asset backed securities and has no obligation to provide liquidity or make monetary contributions or contributions of additional receivables to its spes either due to the performance of the sold receivables or the credit rating of ford credit s short term or long term debt 
however  as the seller and servicer of the finance receivables to the spe  ford credit is obligated to provide certain kinds of support to its securitizations  which are customary in the securitization industry 
these obligations consist of indemnifications  receivable repurchase obligations on receivables that do not meet eligibility criteria or that have been materially modified  the mandatory sale of additional receivables in revolving transactions  and  in some cases  servicer advances of interest shortfalls 
risks to continued funding under securitization programs 
the following securitization programs contain structural features that could prevent ford credit from using these sources of funding in certain circumstances fcar 
if credit losses or delinquencies in ford credit s portfolio of retail  wholesale or lease receivables exceed specified levels  fcar is not permitted to purchase additional asset backed securities of the affected type for so long as such levels are exceeded 
fcar is permitted to purchase only highly rated asset backed securities  and if the credit enhancement on any asset backed security purchased by fcar is reduced to zero  fcar may not purchase any additional asset backed securities and would wind down its operations 
conduits 
if credit losses or delinquencies on the pool of sold receivables held by a conduit exceed specified levels  or if the level of overcollateralization for such pool decreases below a specified level  ford credit will be unable to sell additional pools of receivables to that conduit 
wholesale securitization and motown notes program 
if the payment rates on wholesale receivables are lower than specified levels  the spe will be unable to issue additional securities and any existing securities would begin to amortize 
based on its experience  ford credit does not expect that any of these features will have a material adverse impact on its ability to use securitization to fund its operations 
in addition to the specific transaction related structural features discussed above  ford credit s ability to sell receivables in any of its securitization programs may be affected by the following factors the amount and credit quality of receivables available to sell  the performance of receivables in its previous receivables sales  general demand for the type of receivables supporting the asset backed securities  market capacity for ford credit and ford credit sponsored investments  accounting and regulatory changes  ford credit s credit rating  and the availability of liquidity facilities 
if as a result of any of these or other factors the cost of securitized funding were to increase significantly or funding through securitizations were no longer available to ford credit  it would have a material adverse impact on ford credit s financial condition  results of operations or liquidity

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued aggregate contractual obligations we are party to many contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties 
most of these are debt obligations incurred by our financial services sector 
in addition  as part of our normal business practices  we enter into contracts with suppliers for purchases of certain raw materials  components and services 
these arrangements may contain fixed or minimum quantity purchase requirements 
we enter into such arrangements to facilitate adequate supply of these materials and services 
purchase obligations are defined as off balance sheet agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on the company and that specify all significant terms

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk overview we are exposed to a variety of market and other risks  including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  interest rates  as well as risks to availability of funding sources  hazard events  and specific asset risks 
these risks affect our automotive and financial services sectors differently 
we monitor and manage these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program  which includes regular reports to a central management committee  the global risk management committee grmc 
the grmc is chaired by our chief financial officer  and its members include our treasurer  our controller  and other members of senior management 
our automotive and financial services sectors are exposed to liquidity risk  or the possibility of having to curtail their businesses or being unable to meet present and future financial obligations as they come due because funding sources may be reduced or become unavailable 
we  and particularly ford credit  which comprises substantially all of our financial services sector  maintain plans for sources of funding to ensure liquidity through a variety of economic or business cycles 
as discussed in greater detail in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  our funding sources include sales of receivables in securitizations and other structured financings  unsecured debt issuances and bank borrowings 
we are exposed to a variety of insurable risks  such as loss or damage to property  liability claims  and employee injury 
we protect against these risks through a combination of self insurance and the purchase of commercial insurance designed to protect against events that could generate significant losses 
direct responsibility for the execution of our market risk management strategies resides with our treasurer s office and is governed by written polices and procedures 
separation of duties is maintained between the development and authorization of derivative trades  the transaction of derivatives  and the settlement of cash flows 
regular audits are conducted to ensure that appropriate controls are in place and that they remain effective 
in addition  our market risk exposures and our use of derivatives to manage these exposures are reviewed by the grmc  and the audit and finance committees of our board of directors

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk continued in accordance with corporate risk management policies  we use derivative instruments  such as forward contracts  swaps and options that economically hedge certain exposures foreign currency  commodity  and interest rates 
derivative positions are used to manage underlying exposures  we do not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes 
in certain instances  we forgo hedge accounting  which results in unrealized gains and losses that are recognized currently in net income  examples of economic hedges that do not qualify for hedge accounting include foreign currency hedges of inter company loans and dividends and certain transactions that use multiple hedge instruments 
for additional information on our derivatives  see note of the notes to the financial statements 
the market and counterparty risks of our automotive sector and ford credit are discussed and quantified below 
automotive market and counterparty risk our automotive sector frequently has expenditures and receipts denominated in foreign currencies  including the following purchases and sales of finished vehicles and production parts  debt and other payables  subsidiary dividends  and investments in foreign operations 
these expenditures and receipts create exposures to changes in exchange rates 
we also are exposed to changes in prices of commodities used in our automotive sector and changes in interest rates 
beginning with this report  we have changed our risk disclosure methodology for foreign currency risk and commodity risk to sensitivity analysis  which we believe is a more commonly used and more easily understood disclosure alternative 
foreign currency risk and commodity risk are measured and quantified using a model to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value of currency and commodity derivative instruments with exposure to market risk that assumes instantaneous  parallel shifts in rates and or prices 
for options and instruments with non linear returns  appropriate models are utilized to determine the impact of shifts in rates and prices 
foreign currency risk 
foreign currency risk is the possibility that our financial results could be better or worse than planned because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
accordingly  we use derivative instruments to hedge our economic exposure with respect to forecasted revenues and costs  assets  liabilities  investments in foreign operations  and firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies 
in our hedging actions  we use primarily instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce foreign exchange risk eg  forward contracts and options 
the net fair value of financial instruments with exposure to cash flow foreign currency risk was a liability of million as of december  compared to a net fair value asset of billion as of december  the potential decrease in fair value for such financial instruments  assuming a adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates  would be billion and billion at december  and december   respectively 
commodity price risk 
commodity price risk is the possibility of higher or lower costs due to changes in the prices of commodities  such as non ferrous metals eg  aluminum  precious metals eg  palladium  ferrous metals eg  steel and iron castings  energy eg  natural gas and electricity  and plastics resins eg  polypropylene  which we use in the production of motor vehicles 
steel and resins are our two largest commodity exposures and are among the most difficult to hedge 
we use derivative instruments to hedge the price risk associated with the purchase of those commodities that we can economically hedge primarily non ferrous metals  precious metals and energies 
in our hedging actions  we primarily use instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce commodity price risk eg  financially settled forward contracts  swaps  and options 
the net fair value asset of commodity forward and option contracts as of december  and december  was million and million  respectively 
the potential decrease in fair value of commodity forward and option contracts  assuming a adverse change in the underlying commodity price  would be approximately million at both december  and december  in addition  our purchasing organization with guidance from the grmc as appropriate negotiates contracts to ensure continuous supply of raw materials 
in some cases  these contracts stipulate minimum purchase amounts and specific prices  and as such  play a role in managing price risk 
interest rate risk 
interest rate risk relates to the gain or loss we could incur in our automotive investment portfolio due to a change in interest rates 
our interest rate sensitivity analysis on the investment portfolio includes cash and cash equivalents  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk continued marketable and loaned securities and short term veba assets 
at december   we had billion in our automotive investment portfolio  compared to billion at december  we invest the portfolio in securities of various types and maturities  the value of which are subject to fluctuations in interest rates 
these securities are generally classified as either trading or available for sale 
the trading portfolio gains and losses unrealized and realized are reported in the income statement 
the available for sale portfolio realized gains or losses are reported in the income statement  and unrealized gains and losses are reported in the consolidated statement of stockholders equity in other comprehensive income 
the investment strategy is based on clearly defined risk and liquidity guidelines to maintain liquidity  minimize risk  and earn a reasonable return on the short term investment 
at any time  a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our trading and available for sale portfolios 
as of december   the value of our trading portfolio was billion  which is billion higher than december  the value of our available for sale portfolio was billion  which is billion lower than december  assuming a hypothetical increase in interest rates of one percentage point  the value of our trading and available for sale portfolios would be reduced by million and million  respectively 
this compares to million and million  respectively  as calculated as of december  while these are our best estimates of the impact of the specified interest rate scenario  actual results could differ from those projected 
the sensitivity analysis presented assumes interest rate changes are instantaneous  parallel shifts in the yield curve 
in reality  interest rate changes of this magnitude are rarely instantaneous or parallel 
counterparty risk 
the use of derivatives to manage market risk results in counterparty risk  which is the loss we could incur if a counterparty defaulted on a derivative contract 
we enter into master agreements with counterparties that allow netting of certain exposures in order to manage this risk 
exposures primarily relate to derivative contracts used for managing interest rate  foreign currency exchange rate and commodity price risk 
we  together with ford credit  establish exposure limits for each counterparty to minimize risk and provide counterparty diversification 
our approach to managing counterparty risk is forward looking and proactive  allowing us to take risk mitigation actions before risks become losses 
we establish exposure limits for both net fair value and future potential exposure  based on our overall risk tolerance and ratings based historical default probabilities 
the exposure limits are lower for lower rated counterparties and for longer dated exposures 
we use a monte carlo simulation technique to assess our potential exposure by tenor  defined at a confidence level 
we monitor and report our exposures to the treasurer on a monthly basis 
substantially all of our counterparty exposures are with counterparties that are rated single a or better 
our guidelines for counterparty minimum long term ratings is bbb 
exceptions to these guidelines require prior approval by management

ford credit market risks overview 
ford credit is exposed to a variety of risks in the normal course of its business activities 
in addition to counterparty risk discussed above  ford credit is subject to the following additional types of risks that it seeks to identify  assess  monitor and manage  in accordance with defined policies and procedures market risk 
the possibility that changes in interest and currency exchange rates or prices will have an adverse impact on operating results  credit risk 
the possibility of loss from a customer s failure to make payments according to contract terms  residual risk 
the possibility that the actual proceeds ford credit receives at lease termination will be lower than its projections or return rates will be higher than its projections  and  liquidity risk 
the possibility that ford credit may be unable to meet all current and future obligations in a timely manner 
each form of risk is uniquely managed in the context of its contribution to ford credit s overall global risk 
business decisions are evaluated on a risk adjusted basis and products are priced consistent with these risks 
credit and residual risks are discussed above in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting estimates item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk continued and liquidity risk is discussed above in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
a discussion of ford credit s market risks is included below 
foreign currency risk 
to meet funding objectives  ford credit issues debt or  for its international affiliates  draws on local credit lines in a variety of currencies 
ford credit faces exposure to currency exchange rate changes if a mismatch exists between the currency of its receivables and the currency of the debt funding those receivables 
when possible  receivables are funded with debt in the same currency  minimizing exposure to exchange rate movements 
when a different currency is used  ford credit seeks to minimize the impact of currency exchange rates on operating results by executing foreign currency derivatives 
these derivatives convert substantially all of its foreign currency debt obligations to the local country currency of the receivables 
as a result  ford credit s market risk exposure relating to currency exchange rates is believed to be immaterial 
interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is the primary market risk to which ford credit is exposed and consists principally of re pricing risk or differences in the re pricing characteristics of assets and liabilities 
an instrument s re pricing period is a term used by financial institutions to describe how an interest rate sensitive instrument responds to changes in interest rates 
it refers to the time it takes an instrument s interest rate to reflect a change in market interest rates 
for fixed rate instruments  the re pricing period is equal to the maturity for repayment of the instrument s principal because  with a fixed interest rate  the principal is considered to re price only when re invested in a new instrument 
for a floating rate instrument  the re pricing period is the period of time before the interest rate adjusts to the market rate 
for instance  a floating rate loan whose interest rate is reset to a market index annually on december would have a re pricing period of one year on january  regardless of the instrument s maturity 
ford credit s receivables consist primarily of fixed rate retail installment sale and lease contracts and floating rate wholesale receivables 
fixed rate retail installment sale and lease contracts are originated principally with maturities ranging between two and six years and generally require customers to make equal monthly payments over the life of the contract 
ford credit s funding sources consist primarily of sales of receivables in securitizations and short and long term unsecured debt 
in the case of unsecured term debt  and in an effort to have funds available throughout the business cycle  ford credit may issue debt with five to ten year maturities  which is generally longer than the terms of its assets 
these debt instruments are principally fixed rate and require fixed and equal interest payments over the life of the instrument and a single principal payment at maturity 
ford credit is exposed to interest rate risk to the extent that a difference exists between the re pricing profile of its assets and debt 
specifically  without derivatives  ford credit s assets would re price more quickly than its debt 
ford credit s interest rate risk management objective is to maximize its financing margin while limiting fluctuations caused by changes in interest rates 
ford credit achieves this objective by setting an established risk tolerance range and staying within this tolerance range through an interest rate risk management program that includes entering into derivatives commonly known as interest rate swaps 
on a monthly basis  ford credit determines the sensitivity of the economic value of its portfolio of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities its economic value to hypothetical changes in interest rates 
economic value is a measure of the present value of all future expected cash flows  discounted by market interest rates  and is equal to the present value of interest rate sensitive assets minus the present value of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
ford credit then enters into interest rate swaps  effectively converting portions of its floating rate debt to fixed or its fixed rate debt to floating  to ensure that the sensitivity of its economic value falls within an established target range 
ford credit also monitors the sensitivity of its earnings to interest rates using pre tax net interest income simulation techniques 
these simulations calculate the projected pre tax net interest income of its portfolio of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities under various interest rate scenarios  including both parallel and non parallel shifts in the yield curve 
these quantifications of interest rate risk are reported to our treasurer each month 
the process described above is used to measure and manage the interest rate risk of ford credit s operations in the united states  canada and the united kingdom  which together represented approximately of its total on balance sheet finance receivables at december  for its other international affiliates  ford credit uses a technique commonly referred to as gap analysis  to measure re pricing mismatch 
this process uses re pricing schedules  which group assets  debt and swaps into discrete time bands based on their re pricing characteristics 
under this process  ford credit enters into interest rate swaps  which effectively change the re pricing profile of its debt  to ensure that any re pricing mismatch between assets and liabilities existing in a particular time band falls within an established tolerance 
as a result of its interest rate risk management process  including derivatives  ford credit s debt re prices faster than its assets 
other things being equal  this means that during a period of rising interest rates  the interest rates paid on ford credit s debt will item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk continued increase more rapidly than the interest rates earned on its assets  thereby initially reducing ford credit s pre tax net interest income 
correspondingly  during a period of falling interest rates  ford credit s pre tax net interest income would be expected to initially increase 
to provide a quantitative measure of the sensitivity of its pre tax net interest income to changes in interest rates  ford credit uses interest rate scenarios that assume a hypothetical  instantaneous increase or decrease in interest rates of one percentage point across all maturities a parallel shift  as well as a base case that assumes that interest rates remain constant at existing levels 
the differences between these scenarios and the base case over a twelve month period represent an estimate of the sensitivity of ford credit s pre tax net interest income 
the sensitivity as of year end and was as follows pre tax net interest income impact given a one percentage point instantaneous increase in interest rates in millions pre tax net interest income impact given a one percentage point instantaneous decrease in interest rates in millions december  december  based on assumptions included in the analysis  sensitivity to a one percentage point instantaneous change in interest rates was lower at year end than at year end this change primarily reflects the results of normal fluctuations within the approved tolerances of risk management strategy 
while the sensitivity analysis presented is ford credit s best estimate of the impacts of specified assumed interest rate scenarios  the model ford credit uses for this analysis is heavily dependent on assumptions  so that actual results could differ from those projected 
embedded in the model ford credit uses are assumptions regarding the reinvestment of maturing asset principal  refinancing of maturing debt  and predicted repayment of retail installment sale and lease contracts ahead of contractual maturity 
ford credit s repayment projections of retail installment sale and lease contracts ahead of contractual maturity are based on historical experience 
if interest rates or other factors were to change  the actual prepayment experience could be different than projected 
additionally  interest rate changes of one percentage point or more are rarely instantaneous or parallel  and rates could move more or less than the one percentage point assumed in ford credit s analysis 
as a result  the actual impact to pre tax net interest income could be higher or lower than the results detailed above 
the model used to conduct this analysis also relies heavily on assumptions regarding the reinvestment of maturing asset principal  refinancing of maturing debt  and predicted repayment of sale and lease contracts ahead of contractual maturity 
the fair value of ford credit s net derivative financial instruments derivative assets less derivative liabilities as reported in note of the notes to the financial statements as of december  was billion 
this was approximately billion lower than a year ago 
this decrease primarily reflects weakening of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar primarily euro  british pound and yen  the maturity of swaps that were in the money  and lower mark to market adjustments resulting from interest rate changes
