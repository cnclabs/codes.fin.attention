item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview business and general environment the company  through its subsidiary mortgage guaranty insurance corporation mgic  is the leading provider of private mortgage insurance in the united states to the home mortgage lending industry 
the company s principal products are primary mortgage insurance and pool mortgage insurance 
primary mortgage insurance may be written through the flow market channel  in which loans are insured in individual  loan by loan transactions 
primary mortgage insurance may also be written through the bulk market channel  in which portfolios of loans are individually insured in single  bulk transactions 
the company s results of operations are affected by premiums written and earned premiums written and earned in a year are influenced by o new insurance written  which increases the size of the in force book of insurance 
new insurance written is the aggregate principal amount of the mortgages that are insured during a period and is referred to as niw 
niw is affected by many factors  including the volume of low down payment home mortgage originations and competition to provide credit enhancement on those mortgages  including competition from other mortgage insurers and alternatives to mortgage insurance  such as piggyback loans 
o cancellations  which reduce the size of the in force book of insurance that generates premiums 
cancellations due to refinancings are affected by the level of current mortgage interest rates compared to the mortgage coupon rates throughout the in force book  as well as by home price appreciation 
o premium rates  which are affected by the risk characteristics of the loans insured and the percentage of coverage on the loans 
o premiums ceded to reinsurance subsidiaries of certain mortgage lenders and risk sharing arrangements with the federal national mortgage association and the federal home loan mortgage corporation government sponsored entities or gses 
premiums are generated by the insurance that is in force during all or a portion of the period 
hence  lower average insurance in force in one period compared to another is a factor that will reduce premiums written and earned  although this effect may be mitigated or enhanced by differences in the average premium rate between the two periods as well as by premium that is ceded 
also  niw and cancellations during a period will generally have a greater effect on premiums written and earned in subsequent periods than in the period in which these events occur 
investment income the investment portfolio is comprised almost entirely of highly rated  fixed income securities 
the 
table of contents principal factors that influence investment income are the size of the portfolio and its yield 
as measured by amortized cost which excludes changes in fair market value  such as from changes in interest rates  the size of the investment portfolio  which is principally held by mgic  is mainly a function of cash generated from operations  including investment earnings  less cash used for non investment purposes  such as dividends paid to the company 
losses incurred losses incurred are the expense that results from a payment delinquency on an insured loan 
as explained under critical accounting policies below  this expense is recognized only when a loan is delinquent 
losses incurred are generally affected by o the state of the economy  which affects the likelihood that loans will become delinquent and whether loans that are delinquent cure their delinquency 
the level of delinquencies has historically followed a seasonal pattern  with a reduction in delinquencies in the first part of the year  followed by an increase in the latter part of the year 
o the product mix of the in force book  with loans having higher risk characteristics generally resulting in higher delinquencies and claims 
o the average claim payment  which is affected by the size of loans insured higher average loan amounts tend to increase losses incurred  the percentage coverage on insured loans deeper average coverage tends to increase incurred losses  and housing values  which affect the company s ability to mitigate its losses through sales of properties with delinquent mortgages 
o the distribution of claims over the life of a book 
historically  the first two years after a loan is originated are a period of relatively low claims  with claims increasing substantially for several years subsequent and then declining  although persistency and the condition of the economy can affect this pattern 
underwriting and other expenses the operating expenses of the company generally vary primarily due to contract underwriting volume  which in turn generally varies with the level of mortgage origination activity 
contract underwriting generates fee income included in other revenue 
income from joint ventures the company s results of operations are also affected by income from joint ventures 
joint venture income principally consists of the aggregate results of the company s investment in two less than majority owned joint ventures  credit based asset servicing and securitization llc c bass and sherman financial group llc sherman 
c bass c bass is primarily an investor in the credit risk of credit sensitive single family residential mortgages 
it finances these activities through borrowings included on its balance sheet and by securitization activities generally conducted through off balance sheet entities 
c bass generally retains the first loss and other subordinate securities created in the securitization 
the loans owned by c bass and underlying c bass s mortgage securities investments are serviced by litton loan servicing lp  a subsidiary of c bass litton 
litton s servicing operations primarily support c bass s investment in credit risk  and investments made by funds managed or co managed by c bass  rather than generating 
table of contents fees for servicing loans owned by third parties 
c bass s consolidated results of operations are affected by portfolio revenue  which in turn is primarily affected by net interest income  gain on sale and liquidation and hedging gains and losses related to portfolio assets  net of mark to market and whole loan reserve changes 
o net interest income net interest income is principally a function of the size of c bass s portfolio of whole loans and mortgages and other securities  and the spread between the interest income generated by these assets and the interest expense of funding them 
interest income from a particular security is recognized based on the expected yield for the security 
o gain on sale and liquidation gain on sale and liquidation results from sales of mortgage and other securities  and liquidation of mortgage loans 
securities may be sold in the normal course of business or because of the exercise of call rights by third parties 
mortgage loan liquidations result from loan payoffs  from foreclosure or from sales of real estate acquired through foreclosure 
servicing revenue servicing revenue is a function of the unpaid principal balance of mortgage loans serviced and servicing fees and charges 
the unpaid principal balance of mortgage loans serviced by litton is affected by mortgages acquired by c bass because servicing on subprime and other mortgages acquired is generally transferred to litton 
litton also services or provides special servicing on loans in mortgage securities owned by funds managed or co managed by c bass 
litton also may obtain servicing on loans in third party mortgage securities acquired by c bass or when the loans become delinquent by a specified number of payments known as special servicing 
revenues from money management activities these revenues include management fees from c bass issued collateralized bond obligations cbos  equity in earnings from c bass investments in investment funds managed or co managed by c bass and management fees and incentive income from investment funds managed or co managed by c bass 
transaction revenue  which in turn is affected by gain on securitization and hedging gains and losses related to securitization o gain on securitization gain on securitization is a function of the face amount of the collateral in the securitization and the margin realized in the securitization 
this margin depends on the difference between the proceeds realized in the securitization and the purchase price paid by c bass for the collateral 
the proceeds realized in a securitization include the value of securities created in the securitization that are retained by c bass 

table of contents hedging gains and losses  net of mark to market and whole loan reserve changes hedging gains and losses primarily consist of changes in the value of derivative instruments including interest rate swaps  interest rate caps and futures and short positions  as well as realized gains and losses from the closing of hedging positions 
c bass uses derivative instruments and short sales in a strategy to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on the value of its mortgage loans and securities 
changes in value of derivative instruments are subject to current recognition because c bass does not account for the derivatives as hedges under sfas no 
mortgage and other securities are classified by c bass as trading securities and are carried at fair value  as estimated by c bass 
changes in fair value between period ends a mark to market are reflected in c bass s statement of operations as unrealized gains or losses 
changes in fair value of mortgage and other securities may relate to changes in credit spreads or to changes in the level of interest rates or the slope of the yield curve 
mortgage loans are not marked to market and are carried at the lower of cost or fair value on a portfolio basis  as estimated by c bass 
during a period in which short term interest rates decline  in general  c bass s hedging positions will decline in value and the change in value  to the extent that the hedges related to whole loans  will be reflected in c bass s earnings for the period as an unrealized loss 
the related increase  if any  in the value of mortgage loans will not be reflected in earnings but  absent any countervailing factors  when mortgage loans owned during the period are securitized  the proceeds realized in the securitization should increase to reflect the increased value of the collateral 
sherman sherman is principally engaged in purchasing and collecting for its own account delinquent consumer receivables  which are primarily unsecured  and in originating and servicing subprime credit card receivables 
the borrowings used to finance these activities are included in sherman s balance sheet 
sherman s consolidated results of operations are affected by revenues from delinquent receivable portfolios these revenues are the cash collections on such portfolios  and depend on the aggregate amount of delinquent receivables owned by sherman  the type of receivable and the length of time that the receivable has been owned by sherman 
amortization of delinquent receivable portfolios amortization is the recovery of the cost to purchase the receivable portfolios 
amortization expense is a function of estimated collections from the portfolios over their estimated lives 
if estimated collections cannot be reasonably predicted  cost is fully recovered before any net revenue the difference between revenues from a receivable portfolio and that portfolio s amortization is recognized 
costs of collection  which include servicing fees paid to third parties to collect receivables 
results the company s results of operations in were principally affected by 
table of contents losses incurred losses incurred decreased in compared to  primarily due to a decrease in the estimates regarding how many delinquencies will eventually result in a claim  when compared to premiums written and earned the company s written and earned premiums in were lower than in due to a decline in the average insurance in force 
investment income investment income was higher in than in due to an increase in the average investment portfolio as measured by amortized cost  as well as a slight increase in the pre tax yield 
underwriting and other expenses underwriting and other expenses decreased in  compared to  primarily as a result of decreases in expenses related to contract underwriting activity 
income from joint ventures income from joint ventures increased in  compared to  due to higher income from each of c bass and sherman 

table of contents results of consolidated operations as discussed under forward looking statements and risk factors in item a  actual results may differ materially from the results contemplated by forward looking statements 
the company is not undertaking any obligation to update any forward looking statements it may make in the following discussion or elsewhere in this document even though these statements may be affected by events or circumstances occurring after the forward looking statements were made 
niw the amount of mgic s niw this term is defined under premiums written and earned in the overview business and general environment section during the years ended december   and was as follows year ended december  billions niw flow channel niw bulk channel total niw refinance volume as a of primary flow niw the decrease in niw on a flow basis in was primarily the result of continued market growth for piggyback loans that offer alternatives to mortgage insurance 
for a discussion of niw written through the bulk channel  see bulk transactions below 
the company expects niw in to be slightly below the level in the decrease in niw on a flow basis in  compared to  was primarily related to a decrease in the overall mortgage origination market 

table of contents cancellations and insurance in force niw and cancellations of primary insurance in force during the years ended december   and were as follows year ended december  billions niw cancellations change in primary insurance in force as of december  direct primary insurance in force cancellation activity has historically been affected by the level of mortgage interest rates and the level of home price appreciation 
cancellations generally move inversely to the change in the direction of interest rates  although they generally lag a change in direction 
mgic s persistency rate percentage of insurance remaining in force from one year prior was at december   at december  and at december  the company expects modest improvement in the persistency rate in  although this expectation assumes the absence of significant declines in the level of mortgage interest rates from their level in late february 
table of contents bulk transactions the company s writings of bulk insurance are in part sensitive to the volume of securitization transactions involving non conforming loans 
the company s writings of bulk insurance are also sensitive to competition from other methods of providing credit enhancement in a securitization  including an execution in which the subordinate tranches in the securitization rather than mortgage insurance bear the first loss from mortgage defaults 
competition from such an execution in turn depends on  among other factors  the yield at which investors are willing to purchase tranches of the securitization that involve a higher degree of credit risk compared to the yield for tranches involving the lowest credit risk the difference in such yields is referred to as the spread and the amount of credit for losses that a rating agency will give to mortgage insurance 
as the spread narrows  competition from an execution in which the subordinate tranches bear the first loss increases 
the competitiveness of the mortgage insurance execution in the bulk channel may also be impacted by changes in the company s view of the risk of the business  which is affected by the historical performance of previously insured pools and the company s expectations for regional and local real estate values 
as a result of the sensitivities discussed above  bulk volume can vary materially from period to period 
niw for bulk transactions increased from billion in to billion in due primarily to transactions with customers for which no insurance had been written in  as well as slightly wider spreads in the last few months of in  niw for bulk transactions decreased from billion in  due primarily to narrower spreads and competition from other mortgage insurers 
as it has in past years  the company priced the bulk business written in to generate acceptable returns  there can be no assurance  however  that the assumptions underlying the premium rates will achieve this objective 
pool insurance in addition to providing primary insurance coverage  the company also insures pools of mortgage loans 
new pool risk written during the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
the company s direct pool risk in force was billion  billion and billion at december   and  respectively 
these risk amounts represent pools of loans with contractual aggregate loss limits and those without such limits 
for pools of loans without such limits  risk is estimated based on the amount that would credit enhance the loans in the pool to a aa level based on a rating agency model 
under this model  at december   and  for billion  billion and billion  respectively  of risk without such limits  risk in force is calculated at million  million and million  respectively 
new risk written  under this model  for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
net premiums written and earned net premiums written and earned during decreased  compared to  due to a decline in the average insurance in force  which has continued to decline since the beginning of the company expects the average insurance in force during to be lower than in as a result  the company anticipates that net premiums written and earned in will decline compared to net premium written and earned decreased in  compared to  due to a decline in the average insurance in force  as well as a decrease in new insurance written through the flow and bulk channels 

table of contents risk sharing arrangements for the nine months ended september   approximately of the company s new insurance written on a flow basis was subject to arrangements with reinsurance subsidiaries of certain mortgage lenders or risk sharing arrangements with the gses compared to for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  the percentage of new insurance written during a period covered by such arrangements normally increases after the end of the period because  among other reasons  the transfer of a loan in the secondary market can result in a mortgage insured during a period becoming part of such an arrangement in a subsequent period 
therefore  the percentage of new insurance written covered by such arrangements is not shown for the current quarter 
premiums ceded in such arrangements are reported in the period in which they are ceded regardless of when the mortgage was insured 
in  to reduce exposure to certain geographical areas and categories of risk  including alt a loans loans with reduced levels of borrower disclosure or verification of borrower disclosure  the company entered into two separate excess of loss reinsurance agreements under which it ceded approximately million of risk in force in the aggregate to two special purpose reinsurance companies the sprs 
the sprs are not affiliated with the company and were formed solely to enter into the reinsurance arrangements 
the sprs obtained their capital from institutional investors by issuance of various classes of notes the return on which is linked to the performance of the reinsured portfolio 
the sprs invested the proceeds of the notes in high quality short term investments 
income earned on those investments and reinsurance premiums paid by the company are applied to pay interest on the notes as well as expenses of the sprs 
the investments will be liquidated to pay reinsured loss amounts to the company 
proceeds not required to pay reinsured losses will be applied to pay principal on the notes 
premiums ceded under these agreements have not been material and are included in ceded premiums 
investment income investment income for increased due to an increase in the amortized cost of average invested assets to billion for from billion for  as well as slight increase in the average investment yield 
the portfolio s average pre tax investment yield was at december  and at december  the portfolio s average after tax investment yield was at december  and at december  the company s net realized gains in and resulted primarily from the sale of fixed maturities 
under guidance from the staff of the fasb that was finalized in the fourth quarter of  it could be more likely that a decrease in the market value of certain investments in the company s fixed income portfolio will be required to be recognized as a realized loss in the statement of operations than under the existing accounting standard 
investment income for increased compared to due to an increase in the amortized cost of average invested assets to billion for from billion for the company s net realized gains for resulted primarily from the sale of fixed maturities 
other revenue the decrease in other revenue in  compared to is primarily the result of decreased revenue from non insurance operations  other than contract underwriting 

table of contents the decrease in other revenue in  compared to  is primarily the result of decreased revenue from contract underwriting due to a lower level of mortgage origination activity during compared to losses as discussed in critical accounting policies  consistent with industry practices  loss reserves for future claims are established only for loans that are currently delinquent 
the terms delinquent and default are used interchangeably by the company and are defined as an insured loan with a mortgage payment that is days or more past due 
loss reserves are established by management s estimating the number of loans in the company s inventory of delinquent loans that will not cure their delinquency historically  a substantial majority of delinquent loans have cured  which is referred to as the claim rate  and further estimating the amount that the company will pay in claims on the loans that do not cure  which is referred to as claim severity 
estimation of losses that the company will pay in the future is inherently judgmental 
the conditions that affect the claim rate and claim severity include the current and future state of the domestic economy and the current and future strength of local housing markets 
in  net losses incurred were million  of which million pertained to current year loss development and million pertained to favorable prior years loss development 
in  net losses incurred were million  of which million pertained to current year loss development and million pertained to favorable prior years loss development 
see note loss reserves to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the amount of losses incurred pertaining to current year loss development represents the estimated amount to be ultimately paid on default notices received in the current year 
losses incurred pertaining to the current year decreased in  compared to  primarily due to decreases in the estimates regarding how many primary default notices will eventually result in a claim 
these decreases in estimates relate to an improvement in claim rates in all regions except for the midwest which had a modest increase  as well as a number of recent delinquencies included in the year end default inventory that are reserved for at a reduced claim rate and are as a result of hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma 
the amount of losses incurred pertaining to prior year loss development represents actual claim payments that were higher or lower than what was estimated by the company at the end of the prior year as well as a re estimation of amounts to be ultimately paid on defaults remaining in inventory from the end of the prior year 
this re estimation is the result of management s review of current trends in default inventory  such as defaults that have resulted in a claim  the amount of the claim  the change in relative level of defaults by geography and the change in average loan exposure 
in  the million reduction in losses incurred pertaining to prior years was due primarily to more favorable loss trends experienced during the year 
in  the million reduction in losses incurred pertaining to prior years was due primarily to more stable loss trends experienced in that year 
the company anticipates that losses incurred in will exceed their level 
in  compared to  losses incurred decreased primarily due to a decrease in the delinquency inventory compared to the prior period increase 
this decrease in delinquency inventory was in part offset by increases in the estimates regarding how many delinquencies will eventually result in a claim and how much will be paid on claims

table of contents total loans delinquent percentage of loans delinquent default rate flow loans delinquent percentage of flow loans delinquent default rate bulk loans delinquent percentage of bulk loans delinquent default rate a minus and subprime credit loans delinquent percentage of a minus and subprime credit loans delinquent default rate a portion of a minus and subprime credit loans is included in flow loans delinquent and the remainder is included in bulk loans delinquent 
most a minus and subprime credit loans are written through the bulk channel

year ended december  net paid claims millions flow bulk other as of december   of the company s primary insurance in force was written subsequent to december  on the company s flow business  the highest claim frequency years have typically been the third and fourth year after the year of loan origination 
however  the pattern of claims frequency can be affected by many factors  including low persistency which can have the effect of accelerating the period in the life of a book during which the highest claim frequency occurs and deteriorating economic conditions which can result in increasing claims following a period of declining claims 
on the company s bulk business  the period of highest claims frequency has generally occurred earlier than in the historical pattern on the company s flow business 
underwriting and other expenses the decrease in underwriting and other expenses in  compared to  as well as the decrease in  compared to  is primarily attributable to decreases in expenses related to contract underwriting activity 
the company anticipates that expenses in will increase compared to  due to an increase in expenses related to myers internet  inc acquired in january see note subsequent events to the company s consolidated financial statements  international operations  and expensing of unvested stock options granted in beginning in  the company has expensed the fair value of stock options granted on or after january  consolidated ratios the table below presents the company s consolidated loss  expense and combined ratios for the periods indicated

the combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio 
income taxes the effective tax rate was in  compared to in and in during those periods  the effective tax rate was below the statutory rate of  reflecting the benefits recognized from tax preferenced investments 
tax preferenced investments of the company include tax exempt municipal bonds  interests in mortgage related securities with flow through characteristics and investments in real estate ventures which generate low income housing credits 
changes in the effective tax rate principally result from a higher or lower percentage of total income before tax being generated from tax preferenced investments 
the higher effective tax rate in  compared to  was principally due to less benefits being recognized from these investments

claim payments from an insurer whose claims paying ability rating is aaa are subject to a reduction over the year period of the stress test  while claim payments from a aa rated insurer  such as mgic  are subject to an reduction 
the effect of the differentiation among insurers is to require the gses to have additional capital for coverage on loans provided by a private mortgage insurer whose claims paying rating is less than aaa 
as a result  there is an incentive for the gses to use private mortgage insurance provided by a aaa rated insurer

loss reserves reserves are established for reported insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses based on when notices of default on insured mortgage loans are received 
a default is defined as an insured loan with a mortgage payment that is days or more past due 
reserves are also established for estimated losses incurred on notices of default not yet reported 
consistent with industry practices  the company does not establish loss reserves for future claims on insured loans which are not currently in default 
reserves are established by management using estimated claims rates and claims amounts in estimating the ultimate loss 
the estimated claims rates and claims amounts represent what management believes best reflect the estimate of what will actually be paid on the loans in default 
these estimates are based on management s review of trends in the default inventory  such as defaults that have resulted in a claim  the amount of the claim  the change in the level of defaults by geography and the change in average loan exposure 
amounts for salvage recoverable are considered in the determination of the reserve estimates 
the establishment of loss reserves is subject to inherent uncertainty and requires significant judgment by management 
adjustments to reserve estimates are reflected in the financial statements in the years in which the adjustments are made 
the liability for reinsurance assumed is based on information provided by the ceding companies 
the incurred but not reported ibnr reserves referred to above result from defaults occurring prior to the close of an accounting period  but which have not been reported to the company 
consistent with reserves for reported defaults  ibnr reserves are established using estimated claims rates and claims amounts for the estimated number of defaults not reported 
as of december  and  the company has established ibnr reserves in the amount of million and million  respectively 
reserves also provide for the estimated costs of settling claims  including legal and other expenses and general expenses of administering the claims settlement process
