critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements and related notes  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles used in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during a reporting period 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable 
as a result  actual results could differ because of the use of these estimates and assumptions 
the company s significant accounting policies can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this form k 
the company believes the following accounting policies are most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the company s reported financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition sales are recognized by the company at the point of purchase when the customer takes possession of the merchandise and pays for the purchase  typically with cash or credit card 
sales from purchases made with gift certificates or gift cards are also recorded when the customer takes possession of the merchandise 
gift certificates and gift cards issued by the company are recorded as a liability until they are redeemed 
the company has established an allowance for sales returns by customers 
this allowance has been calculated using estimates based on historical experience 
inventory valuation merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the first in  first out retail inventory method 
permanent markdowns of inventory are recorded monthly based on an evaluation by merchandising management  which includes analyzing inventory levels and aging  as well as rate of sale 
the company further reduces the value of inventory by recording an allowance for permanent markdowns based on inventory levels from the season which immediately precedes the current season as of the reporting date 
permanent markdowns on this merchandise take into account the future anticipated selling price of the inventory 
to the extent that management s estimates differ from actual results  additional markdowns may have to be recorded  which could reduce the company s operating income and adversely affect its financial position and results of operations 
for the fiscal years ended february   february  and february   permanent inventory markdowns totaled   and  respectively 
property  equipment and improvements property  equipment and improvements are stated at cost 
property and equipment is depreciated over its estimated useful life  three to five years for computer hardware and software  seven years for furniture  fixtures and other equipment  and years for the company s corporate office and distribution center and related building improvements 
store leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the useful life or the term of the related leases  which is typically ten years 
repairs and maintenance which do not extend an asset s useful life are expensed as incurred 
when assets are retired or otherwise disposed of  the cost and related accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed from the accounts  and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in income or expense for that period 
the company reviews property  plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the net book value of an asset may not be recoverable  but at least annually 
an impairment loss is recognized when the net book value of an asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
the impairment loss recorded is the excess of the asset s net book value over its fair value 
fair value is determined based upon the best information available under the circumstances including quoted prices or other valuation techniques 
rent expense  deferred rent obligations and deferred lease incentives the company leases all of its store locations under operating leases 
most of these lease agreements contain tenant improvement allowances funded by landlord incentives  rent holidays  rent escalation clauses and or contingent rent provisions 
accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america require rent expense to be recognized on a straight line basis over the lease term 
the difference between the rent due under the stated periods of the lease compared to that of the straight line basis is recorded as a deferred rent obligation within other noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
for purposes of recognizing landlord incentives and minimum rental expenses on a straight line basis over the terms of the leases  the company uses the date that it obtains the legal right to use and control the leased space to begin amortization  which is generally when the company enters the space and begins to make improvements in preparation of opening the new store location 
for tenant improvement allowances funded by landlord incentives and rent holidays  the company records a deferred lease incentive liability in other noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet and amortizes the deferred liability as a reduction of rent expense on the consolidated statement of income over the term of the lease  not including any renewal option periods 
certain lease agreements contain rent escalation clauses which provide for scheduled rent increases during the lease term or for rental payments commencing at a date other than the date of initial occupancy 
such stepped rent expense is recorded in the consolidated statement of income on a straight line basis over the lease term  not including any renewal option periods 
the company s leases may also provide for contingent rents  which are determined as a percentage of revenues in excess of specified levels 
the company records a contingent rent liability in other accrued liabilities within current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet  along with the corresponding rent expense in the consolidated statement of income  when specified levels have been achieved or when management determines that achieving the specified levels during the fiscal year is probable 
in addition  the company has a limited number of other lease agreements for retail space which include escalation in minimum rent based on increases in the consumer price index  not to exceed 
for purposes of calculating rent expense and future minimum lease payments  the company utilizes the maximum annual increase of 
the company also recognizes the related rent expense for these leases on a straight line basis and records the difference between the recognized rent expense and amounts payable under the lease as deferred rent obligations 
long lived assets the company reviews long lived assets with definite lives at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
this review includes the evaluation of individual under performing stores and assessing the recoverability of the carrying value of the improvements and equipment related to the store 
future cash flows are projected for the remaining lease life considering such factors as future sales levels  operating income  changes in rent and other expenses  as well as the overall operating environment specific to that store 
if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the assets  the company records an impairment charge equal to the difference between the assets fair value and carrying value 
as the projection of future cash flows involves judgment and estimates  differences in circumstances or estimates could produce different results 
goodwill the company recognizes the excess cost of an acquired entity over the net amount assigned to assets acquired  including intangible assets  and liabilities assumed as goodwill 
goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter  and between annual tests whenever there is an impairment indicated 
fair values are estimated based on future discounted cash flows and are compared with the corresponding carrying value of the related assets 
impairment losses will be recognized if the fair value of a reporting unit were less than the reporting unit s carrying value

merchandise  buying and occupancy costs  exclusive of depreciation and amortization  were million  or of net sales  during the fiscal year ended february   compared to million  or of net sales  during the fiscal year ended february  the decline in merchandising  buying and occupancy costs as a percent of net sales was mainly attributable to reduced markdowns resulting from improved inventory control and stronger acceptance of the company s merchandise assortment and  to a lesser extent  improved initial markups 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or of net sales  in fiscal  compared to million  or of net sales  in fiscal the approximate basis point increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales was primarily the result of the inclusion of acorn related expenses for the entire year  increased self insured medical and workers compensation claims  contractual obligations of million due to william prange  the company s former chief executive officer  and store salaries and other administrative costs which could not be leveraged with a increase in same store sales

net sales for the year ended february  were million  an increase of million  or  from net sales of million for the year ended february  the increase in net sales was attributable to an increase in the number of stores operated by the company during the year  partially offset by a decline in same store sales 
the company operated stores at february   compared to stores at february  management believes the decline in same store sales was attributable to a softer than expected customer response to the company s merchandise assortment  continued economic weakness affecting the spending patterns of the moderate income consumer and a very competitive apparel retail environment

the company typically does not expand or relocate stores within a mall

merchandise  buying and occupancy costs  exclusive of depreciation and amortization  were million  or of net sales  in fiscal  compared to million  or of net sales  during fiscal the increase in merchandising  buying and occupancy costs as a percent of net sales was mainly attributable to lower merchandise margins  primarily due to higher markdowns  as well as approximately basis points of negative leverage of store rent expense 
the negative leverage of store rent expense resulted from a decline in same store sales combined with operating more stores in fiscal which were still in the buildup phase of their sales curve 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or of net sales  in fiscal  compared to million  or of net sales  in fiscal the approximate basis point increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales was primarily the result of increased store salaries expense  self insured medical costs  asset impairment charges and other administrative costs that could not be leveraged with a decline in same store sales  partially offset by a decrease in store supplies expense

the provision for income taxes was million in fiscal  with an effective tax rate of  compared to million  with an effective tax rate of  in fiscal net income 
as a result of the foregoing factors  net income for the year ended february  was million  or of net sales and per diluted share  compared to net income of million  or of net sales and per diluted share for the year ended february  in fiscal  earnings of approximately per diluted share can be attributed to the company s repurchase of  shares of its common stock in february and the first nine months of fiscal liquidity and capital resources the company s principal on going cash requirements are to finance the construction of new stores and the remodeling of certain existing stores  to purchase merchandise inventory and to fund other working capital requirements 
merchandise purchases vary on a seasonal basis  peaking in the fall 
as a result  the company s cash requirements historically reach their peak in october or november 
conversely  cash balances peak in january after the holiday season is completed 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled million in fiscal  up from million in fiscal due primarily to increases in net income and accrued liabilities and a decrease in merchandise inventory 
net cash used in investing activities included million of capital expenditures  partially offset by approximately million of net redemptions of short term investments

in november  the wells fargo revolver was amended to increase the amount of revolving credit loans and letters of credit available to the company from million to million  subject to a borrowing base formula based on inventory levels 
additionally  the maturity date of the wells fargo revolver was extended by two years to june  loans under the wells fargo revolver bear interest at wells fargo s base rate  as of february   plus 
interest is payable monthly in arrears 
the wells fargo revolver carries a facility fee of based on the unused portion as defined in the agreement 
facility fees totaled  in fiscal the credit facility is collateralized by the company s equipment  general intangibles  inventory  inventory letters of credit and letter of credit rights 
the company had no revolving credit loan borrowings under the wells fargo revolver during fiscal or fiscal historically  the wells fargo revolver has been utilized by the company only to open letters of credit to facilitate the import of merchandise 
the borrowing base at february  was million 
as of february   the company had outstanding letters of credit in the amount of million 
accordingly  the availability of revolving credit loans under the wells fargo revolver was million at february  the wells fargo revolver contains certain restrictive covenants  including restrictions on incurring additional indebtedness and limitations on certain types of investments  as well as requiring the maintenance of certain financial ratios 
as of february   the most recent measurement date  the company was in compliance with all covenants of the wells fargo revolver 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations at february  contractual obligations due in total less than year years years more than years long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases purchase obligations other liabilities total the company s contractual obligations include operating leases for each of its retail store locations and vehicles and purchase obligations consisting of million of open purchase orders for goods currently in production with foreign suppliers 
these open purchase orders are secured by letters of credit for which the company is contingently liable 
as of february   the company had no other contractual obligations relating to short or long term debt  capital leases or non cancelable purchase obligations 
in addition  the company had no contractual obligations relating to the other liabilities recorded in the company s balance sheet under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as of february   the company s other liabilities consisted of deferred rent  deferred lease incentives  deferred revenue and deferred income taxes 
the company does not have relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purposes entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet financial arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  the company is not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if the company had engaged in such relationships 
the company s related party transactions are limited to employment agreements with certain officers 
in addition  the company does not maintain any long term or exclusive commitments or arrangements to purchase merchandise from any of its suppliers 
merchandise sourcing the company directly imported approximately of its total merchandise purchases in fiscal this reliance on sourcing from foreign countries may cause the company to be exposed to certain risks 
import restrictions  including tariffs and quotas  and changes in such restrictions  could affect the import of apparel and might result in increased costs  delays in merchandise receipts or reduced supplies of apparel available to the company and could possibly have an adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and or results of operations 
the company s merchandise flow could also be adversely affected by political or financial instability in any of the countries where its merchandise is manufactured or by changes in the united states governmental policies toward such foreign countries 
in addition  merchandise receipts could be delayed due to interruptions in air  ocean and ground shipments 
substantially all of the company s directly imported merchandise is manufactured in southeast asia 
the majority of these goods are produced in china  hong kong  indonesia and singapore 
the company is not currently importing merchandise produced in the middle east 
the company has no stores located in louisiana or mississippi  one store located in northern alabama and one store located in southeast texas 
accordingly  the direct impact of hurricanes katrina and rita have had an immaterial effect on the company s financial position and results of operations in fiscal direct imports accounted for approximately of the company s total merchandise purchases in fiscal during fiscal  the company purchased approximately of its merchandise from vendors and the company s ten largest vendors provided approximately of the company s purchases 
in addition  purchases from the company s largest overseas supplier accounted for approximately of total purchases  compared to in fiscal in fiscal  management plans to continue to make changes to its merchandise assortment and further diversify its vendor base 
although the company believes that its relationship with its largest vendor is good  there can be no assurance that this relationship can be maintained in the future or that the vendor will continue to supply merchandise to the company 
if there should be any significant disruption in the supply of merchandise from this vendor  management believes that it will be able to shift production to other suppliers so as to continue to secure the required volume of product 
nevertheless  it is possible that any significant disruption in supply could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial position and results of operations 
the company intends to directly import approximately of its purchases again in fiscal quota restrictions on december   quota restrictions expired on the importing of apparel to the united states from foreign countries which are members of the world trade organization 
the effect this quota expiration will have on global sourcing patterns is uncertain  but is likely to cause further retail price deflation 
management believes it can adjust to potential shifts in the availability of apparel following the expiration of these quotas 
however  the company s sourcing operations may be adversely effected by trade limits or political and financial instability resulting in the disruption of trade from exporting countries 
quarterly results and seasonality the company s sales reflect seasonal variation as sales in the third and fourth quarters  which include the fall and holiday seasons  generally have been higher than sales in the first and second quarters 
sales and operating income generated during the fall and holiday seasons have a significant impact on the company s annual results of operations 
quarterly results may fluctuate significantly depending on a number of factors including timing of new store openings  adverse weather conditions  shifts in the timing of certain holidays and customer response to the company s seasonal merchandise mix 
inflation although the operations of the company are influenced by general economic conditions  the company does not believe that inflation had a material effect on the results of operations during fiscal  and recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
r  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
the original effective date for adoption of sfas no 
r for the company was august  however  in april the securities and exchange commission sec announced the adoption of a new rule that amends the effective date for sfas no 
r 
the sec now allows companies to implement sfas no 
r at the beginning of their next fiscal year  instead of the next reporting period  that begins after june  the company adopted sfas no 
r effective for its fiscal year  which commenced on february   using the modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized for all share based payments granted after february  and all share based payments granted on or prior to february  that remain unvested as of such date 
the impact of sfas no 
r on the company s consolidated statements of income in fiscal and beyond will depend upon various factors  including the amount of awards granted and the fair value of those awards at the time of grant 
the company currently anticipates that the estimated impact of adopting sfas no 
r for fiscal will result in pre tax stock based compensation expense of approximately million  or approximately per diluted share on an after tax basis 
sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow  rather then as an operating cash flow as had previously been required under the applicable literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in the periods after adoption 
the company cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend upon  among other things  when employees exercise stock

is expected to have no impact on the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the market risk inherent in the company s financial instruments and in its financial position represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates 
the company s results of operations could be negatively impacted by decreases in interest rates on its short term investments 
the company is potentially exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates relating to its revolving credit and security agreement with wells fargo bank 
loans under the wells fargo revolver bear interest at wells fargo s fluctuating base rate  as of february   plus 
however  the company had no revolving credit loan borrowings under the wells fargo revolver during fiscal or fiscal and  given its existing liquidity position  does not expect to utilize the wells fargo revolver in the future except for its continuing use of the import letter of credit facility 
the company enters into certain purchase obligations outside the united states  which are denominated settled in us dollars 
therefore  the company has only minimal exposure to foreign currency exchange risks 
the company does not hedge against foreign currency risks and believes that its foreign currency exchange risk is immaterial 
the company does not have any derivative financial instruments and does not hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes
