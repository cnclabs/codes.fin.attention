net sales for fiscal totaled million compared to million in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
net sales for fiscal were up from million in fiscal this increase in net sales was primarily due to the acquisitions collegiate pacific completed during fiscal  and  as well as organic growth from the sale of the company s existing products 
gross profit percentage decreased slightly to in fiscal from in fiscal and in fiscal the decrease in our gross profit percentage in fiscal was due primarily to our acquisition of sport supply group ssg  which experienced a gross profit margin of and included a lower margin of million for goods acquired in connection with the purchase of ssg 
the decrease in gross profit margin for fiscal  compared to fiscal  was mainly due to the increase in sales of soft goods from the recently acquired companies  other than ssg 
operating profit for fiscal increased to million  or of net sales  compared to operating profit of million  or of net sales  in fiscal and operating profit of million  or of net sales  in fiscal the increase in operating profit reflects higher sales volume  partially offset by higher selling and general and administrative expenses 
the decline in operating profit as a percentage of sales was due to the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal  which was primarily attributable to

table of contents this new source of capital provides collegiate pacific more opportunity and flexibility to make progress toward its strategic objectives 
fiscal acquisitions and related developments on july   we completed the acquisition of of the outstanding capital stock of ssg from emerson radio corp and emerson radio hong kong limited for million in cash 
ssg is a direct marketer and bb e commerce supplier of sporting goods and physical education equipment to the institutional and youth sports market 
the acquisition of of ssg was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and  accordingly  the net assets and results of operations of ssg have been included in the company s consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition 
the purchase price was allocated to assets acquired of approximately million  plus identifiable intangible assets acquired  which included million for non compete agreements  million for customer relationships  thousand for a customer database  thousand for significant contracts  thousand for contractual backlog  thousand for photo library and thousand for bid database calendar  and liabilities assumed based on their respective estimated fair values of approximately million at the date of acquisition 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired has been recorded as goodwill in the amount of approximately million 
on september   the company announced it entered into an agreement and plan of merger the merger agreement pursuant to which the company would have acquired the remaining of the outstanding capital stock of ssg that it did not already own 
under the terms of the merger agreement  each ssg stockholder would have receive shares of the company s common stock for each share of ssg common stock  which valued each ssg share at per share  which is the same per share price the company paid in cash for its purchase of of the outstanding capital stock of ssg on july  on november   however  the company announced it had entered into an agreement with ssg to terminate the merger agreement after determining the merger was unlikely to close in a timely fashion under previously contemplated terms 
under the terms of the termination agreement  dated november   the company agreed to reimburse ssg for up to thousand for the fees and expenses incurred by ssg in connection with the merger agreement 
on november   the company announced its purchase of  shares of ssg  or an additional of ssg s outstanding common shares  for approximately million in cash from an institutional holder  representing a purchase price of per share  as well as purchased an additional  shares of ssg in open market transactions at an average price of per share

albert messier  one of the former principal stockholders of salkeld  for approximately million in cash and the issuance of  shares of the company s common stock to mr 
messier  which were valued at approximately thousand

the company entered into a lease with mr 
messier for his thousand square foot screen print and distribution facility in bourbonnais  illinois 
the term of the lease runs through july  and the monthly rental rate is approximately thousand 
the company s wholly owned subsidiary  salkeld  employs mr 
messier 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired has been recorded as goodwill in the amount of million 
matters affecting comparability collegiate pacific s operating results for fiscal include the operating results of tomark and kesslers  both of which we acquired in fiscal  dixie  which we acquired during the first quarter of fiscal  ots  which we acquired during the second quarter of fiscal  salkeld  which we acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal  ssg and team print  each since their respective acquisition 
table of contents date 
however  the consolidated statement of income for fiscal does not include the operating results for the ssg and team print acquisitions since those acquisitions were completed after june  further  the consolidated statement of income for fiscal does not include the operating results for the dixie  ots or salkeld acquisitions since those acquisitions were completed after june  for income tax purposes  only the goodwill associated with the company s acquisition of kesslers  ots and team print is deductible over a period of years 
the goodwill acquired by the company in connection with the other acquisitions is not deductible for income tax purposes because the company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of those targets 
although the acquisition of ots was an acquisition of stock  the parties to the transaction made a section h election under the internal revenue code to tax the transaction as if it was an acquisition of assets 
consolidated results of operations the following table sets forth selected financial data and certain ratios and relationships calculated from the consolidated statements of income for the fiscal years ended june   and fiscal vs

net sales for fiscal totaled million compared to million in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
net sales grew by a combined million from the businesses we acquired during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  and the growth in our existing catalog operations of approximately million 
we expect the net sales from kesslers  dixie  ots and salkeld to continue to increase in fiscal as we continue with our ongoing efforts to direct a selection of our traditional catalog customers to our acquired road sales professionals 
during fiscal  these efforts contributed to the growth in net sales for our acquired businesses due to the shift in net sales from our traditional catalog operations to our newly acquired businesses 
we believe if we can successfully service a selection of our traditional catalog customers in specific regions of the united states with our road sales professionals  we will continue to grow our net sales through greater account penetration and retention 
the increase in sales for our existing catalog operations was due to our expanded product offerings and the overall growth in our customer base 
although we believe future net sales will continue to rise from current levels  no assurances can be made that any future increases in net sales will be at the same rate 

table of contents historically  sales of our sporting goods have experienced seasonal fluctuations 
this seasonality causes our financial results to vary from quarter to quarter  which usually results in lower net sales and operating profit in the second quarter of our fiscal year october through december and higher net sales and operating profit in the remaining quarters of our fiscal year  especially the first and fourth quarters of our fiscal year july through september and april through june  respectively 
we attribute this seasonality primarily to the budgeting procedures of our customers and the seasonal demand for our products  which have historically been driven by spring and summer sports 
generally  between the months of october and december of each fiscal year  there is a lower level of sports activities at our non retail institutional customer base  a higher degree of adverse weather conditions and a greater number of school recesses and major holidays 
we believe the acquisitions of our team dealers kesslers  dixie  ots  and salkeld  which have a greater focus on fall and winter sports  have reduced the seasonality of our financial results 
ssg  which follows the selling pattern of the company s traditional catalog operations  may impact our financial results by decreasing our net sales and operating profit in the second quarter of our fiscal year and increasing our net sales and operating profit in the third and fourth fiscal quarters

the increase in our gross profit was due to the increase in our net sales during fiscal we continue to direct a selection of our traditional catalog customers to our road sales professionals 
we believe these efforts have contributed to the growth in our net sales volume and anticipate this trend will continue in future periods as our road sales professionals continue to expand the number of face to face sales calls to our traditional non retail institutional customers 
although we do from time to time adjust the selling price of our products  we do not believe any price adjustments during fiscal contributed to our increase in net sales 
the decrease in gross profit margin for fiscal  compared to fiscal  was primarily due to the acquisition of ssg 
ssg experienced a gross profit margin of for fiscal  which included a lower margin of million for goods acquired in connection with the purchase of ssg and was the result of the application of statement of financial accounting standards no 
business combinations 
we expect to see an increase in our gross profit margin in the future as we complete our field training efforts with our road sales professionals and benefit from the results of those efforts in the form of increased sales of our sporting goods equipment 
prior to working for the company  our road sales professionals primarily sold soft goods and only a small percentage of their overall sales were attributable to sales of sporting goods equipment 
as our road sales professionals continue to increase their sales of our sporting goods equipment  along with our soft goods  we anticipate our gross profit margin will continue to be positively impacted to the extent our sales of sporting goods and equipment increase at a faster rate than our sales of soft goods

either the company or ssg may experience periods of higher borrowing under the senior secured credit facility and the ssg credit facility  as the case may be  due to the seasonal nature of their respective business cycles

risk factors affecting collegiate pacific s business and prospects there are numerous risk factors that affect our business and the results of our operations 
these risk factors include general economic and business conditions  the level of demand for our products and services  the level and intensity of competition in the sporting goods industry  our ability to timely and effectively manage the introduction of new products and the market s acceptance of those products  our ability to develop new and enhance our existing relationships with customers and suppliers  our ability to effectively manage our growth  and the effect of armed hostilities and terrorism on the economy generally  on the level of demand for our products and services  and our ability to manage our supply and delivery logistics in such an environment 
for a discussion of these and other risk factors affecting collegiate pacific s business and prospects  see item a risk factors 
critical accounting policies collegiate pacific s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
discussed below are several significant accounting policies  which require the use of judgments and estimates that may materially affect the consolidated financial statements 
the estimates described below are reviewed from time to time and are subject to change if the circumstances so indicate 
the effect of any such change is reflected in results of operations for the period in which the change is made 
inventories 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market value 
cost is determined using the standard cost method which approximates average cost for items manufactured by us and the weighted average cost method for items purchased for resale 
we record adjustments to our inventories for estimated obsolescence or diminution in market value equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value  based on market conditions from time to time 
these adjustments are estimates  which could vary significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from actual experience if future economic conditions  levels of customer demand or competitive conditions differ 
table of contents from expectations 
because valuing our inventories at lower of cost or market requires significant management judgment  we believe the accounting estimate related to our inventories is a critical accounting estimate 
management of the company has discussed this critical accounting estimate with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed the company s disclosure relating to it in this annual report on form k 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we evaluate the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where there is knowledge of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  a specific allowance is provided to reduce the net receivable to the amount that is reasonably believed to be collectable 
for all other customers  allowances are established based on historical bad debts  customer payment patterns and current economic conditions 
the establishment of these allowances requires the use of judgment and assumptions regarding the potential for losses on receivable balances 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required resulting in an additional charge to expenses when made 
because estimating our uncollectible accounts requires significant management judgment  we believe the accounting estimate related to our allowance for doubtful accounts is a critical accounting estimate 
management of the company has discussed this critical accounting estimate with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed the company s disclosure relating to it in this annual report on form k 
at june   our total allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately million  compared to million as of june  and thousand as of june  the increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts for fiscal was primarily attributable to the increase in the company s overall sales volume at june  see note in notes to consolidated financial statements 
goodwill  intangibles and long lived assets 
we assess the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill  intangibles and long lived assets periodically 
if circumstances suggest that long lived assets may be impaired  and a review indicates the carrying value will not be recoverable  the carrying value is reduced to its estimated fair value 
as of june   the balance sheet includes approximately million of goodwill and intangible assets  net  million of fixed assets  net  and million of deferred debt issuance costs 
the company has concluded that no impairment exists 
because estimating the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets requires significant management judgment and our use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used would have an impact on our reported net long lived assets  we believe the accounting estimates related to our impairment testing are critical accounting estimates 
management of the company has discussed this critical accounting estimate with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed the company s disclosure relating to it in this annual report on form k 
accounting for business combinations 
whenever we acquire a business  significant estimates are required to complete the accounting for the transaction 
we hire independent valuation experts familiar with purchase accounting issues and we work with them to ensure that all identifiable intangibles are properly identified and assigned appropriate values 
impact of inflation and changing prices the inflation rate  as measured by the us consumer price index  has been relatively low in the last few years and  therefore  pricing decisions by collegiate pacific have largely been influenced by competitive market conditions 
depreciation expense is based on the historical cost to collegiate pacific of its fixed assets and  therefore  is considerably less than it would be if it were based on current replacement cost 
while buildings  machinery and equipment acquired in prior years will ultimately have to be replaced at significantly higher prices  it is expected this will be a gradual process over many years

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates collegiate pacific is exposed to interest rate risk in connection with its borrowings under the senior secured credit facility  which bear interest at floating rates based on london inter bank offered rate libor or the prime rate plus an applicable borrowing margin 
for our million of notes  interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
conversely  for variable rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value but do impact future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
as of june   collegiate pacific had million in principal amount of fixed rate debt represented by the notes and million of variable rate debt represented by borrowings under the senior secured credit facility 
based on the balance outstanding under the variable rate facilities as of june   an immediate change of one percentage point in the applicable interest rate would have caused an increase or decrease in interest expense of approximately thousand on an annual basis 
at june   up to million of variable rate borrowings were available under collegiate pacific s revolving facility 
there were no borrowings at june   under the ssg credit facility 
based on the average borrowings against the ssg credit facility during fiscal  an immediate change of one percentage point in the applicable interest rate would have caused an increase or decrease in interest expense of approximately thousand on an annual basis 
we may use derivative financial instruments  where appropriate  to manage our interest rate risks 
however  as a matter of policy  collegiate pacific does not enter into derivative or other financial investments for trading or speculative purposes 
at june   collegiate pacific had no such derivative financial instruments outstanding 
foreign currency and derivatives we do not use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency risk related to the procurement of merchandise inventories from foreign sources and we do not earn income denominated in foreign currencies 
we recognize all of our revenue and pay all of our obligations in us dollars
