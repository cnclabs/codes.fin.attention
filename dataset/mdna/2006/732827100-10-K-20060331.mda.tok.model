item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  the company reevaluated its decision to close the midway sawmill and on january   the company announced that it would continue to operate the midway sawmill on a reduced basis after march  pulp business the pulp business comprises three pulp mills  located in halsey  oregon  and in nanaimo and mackenzie  british columbia  with approximately  metric tons of total annual capacity and the ability to offer customers a variety of pulp products 
nbsk pulp produced in the pacific northwest and british columbia is generally considered to be a premium pulp product because it is made from northern softwood trees whose long fibers give it superior strength characteristics relative to other grades of pulp 
the company s mill locations provide cost efficient access to northern softwood fiber 
canadian operations nanaimo mill operations and fiber supply with a current annual capacity of approximately  metric tons  the nanaimo mill is the fifth largest producer of market pulp in canada  according to pricewaterhousecoopers llp s market pulp benchmarking study of the nanaimo mill manufactures a wide range of high quality nbsk pulp made from custom blends of western hemlock  balsam  western red cedar and douglas fir 
the nanaimo mill is located on a deep water harbor on vancouver island that provides cost effective access to overseas customers in europe and asia 
the company s nanaimo pulp mill s long term fiber supply agreement with weyerhaeuser company limited weyerhaeuser was assumed by cascadia forest products ltd cascadia  a wholly owned subsidiary of brascan corporation  in may  concurrent with the sale of weyerhaeuser s coastal sawmill and timberlands 
the contract allows the company to acquire up to million cubic meters of fiber per year through  which represents approximately percent of the nanaimo mill s fiber requirements 
under this contract fiber is purchased at market prices determined under a formula intended to reflect market value of the fiber and which takes into account the net sales value of pulp sold by the nanaimo mill 
the company has entered into arrangements with other independent fiber suppliers to provide wood chips incremental to that provided by cascadia 
to a limited degree  the nanaimo pulp mill also has the ability to acquire wood chips from the company s canadian sawmills 
in  the company purchased percent of its fiber requirements from independent fiber suppliers other than cascadia or weyerhaeuser 
mackenzie mill operations and fiber supply located in northern british columbia  the mackenzie pulp mill is known for producing a particularly fine grade of nbsk pulp from chips and sawdust 
a synergistic fit with the company s existing nanaimo and halsey pulp mills  the mackenzie facility provides the company the ability to offer customers additional types of products 
the mackenzie mill has an annual production capacity of approximately  metric tons 
the company s mackenzie pulp mill purchased approximately percent of its fiber requirements in from sawmills primarily located in mackenzie  british columbia and currently operated by canfor corporation canfor  primarily under long term  evergreen contracts 
under these contracts  fiber is purchased at market prices  or at prices determined under a formula intended to reflect the fair market value of the fiber  and which takes into account the net sales value of pulp sold by the mackenzie mill 
the company has entered into arrangements with other independent fiber suppliers to provide fiber incremental to that provided by canfor 
the company believes there is an abundance of fiber resources available within an economic radius of the mill that will be adequate for the mackenzie pulp mill s requirements 
the wood chip supply availability in the northern interior of british columbia increased significantly in due to the high operating rates of the region s sawmills resulting from the area s mountain pine beetle 
table of contents epidemic 
the company s mackenzie pulp mill and fort st 
james sawmill operate in this area 
in the third quarter  certain chip suppliers implemented a revised chip pricing formula in the region 
chip prices were reduced by approximately us per bone dry unit  or percent 
us operations halsey mill operations and fiber supply the halsey mill  with an annual capacity of approximately  metric tons  produces nbsk pulp that is sold in various forms to printing and writing paper  tissue  and newsprint manufacturers in the pacific northwest  asia  and european markets 
in addition  halsey s unbleached pulp is utilized in the production of cement fiber board 
substantially all of the company s wood chip and sawdust requirements for the halsey pulp mill are satisfied through purchases from third parties 
the company has long term chip and sawdust supply arrangements and also has established supplier relationships with sawmills and veneer plants in the pacific northwest 
the company has the capability of using both sawdust and wood chips as a raw material 
sawdust has historically been less expensive than softwood chips as a raw material for pulp production 
in  approximately percent of halsey s production was sawdust pulp 
additionally  the company continues to use an expanded geographic base to maintain an adequate supply of chips for the portion of the halsey pulp mill s production which is based on softwood chips 
the company believes that  based on existing wood chip and sawdust availability both within the willamette valley region of oregon and from other sources  fiber resources will be adequate for the company s requirements at the halsey pulp mill for the foreseeable future 
marketing and distribution the company s pulp is marketed globally through sales offices in portland  oregon and brussels  belgium and through agency sales offices around the world 
in  approximately percent of the pulp segment s revenues were derived from sales to europe  percent to north america  percent to asia and percent to other markets 
the company sold pulp products to numerous customers during  none of which accounted for more than percent of consolidated revenues 
in  approximately percent of the company s pulp was sold to customers at market prices under long term or evergreen contracts  renewable each year 
approximately percent was sold to other repetitive customers without contract  with the balance sold on a spot basis 
by establishing and maintaining long term contractual relationships  the company is better able to forecast and regulate production 
backlog the company s pulp customers enter into contracts for periods of one to three years or purchase pulp on a spot basis 
the contractual customers provide the company with annual estimates of their requirements  followed by periodic orders based on more definitive information 
at december   the company s backlog of orders believed to be firm for both contractual and non contractual customers was million compared with million at december  the backlog of pulp orders at year end represents orders which are expected to be filled in the first quarter of the following year 
competition the pulp industry is highly competitive  with a substantial number of competitors having extensive financial resources  manufacturing expertise  and sales and distribution organizations  many of which are larger than the company  but none of which is believed to be dominant 
canada and the nordic countries produce substantially more market pulp than they consume  with the surplus being sold in northern europe  the united states  japan and other asian countries 
canada  finland  norway and sweden are the principal suppliers of northern bleached softwood kraft pulp to world markets 
the united states is a large exporter of hardwood and southern softwood pulp 
latin america also exports both hardwood and softwood pulp 

table of contents the principal methods of competition in the pulp market are price  quality  volume  reliability of supply and customer service 
the company s competitive advantages include the strength of its northern softwood fiber  and the variety and consistent quality of the pulp it produces 
in addition  nanaimo has the operational flexibility provided by its three separate production lines in combination with the three principal species of fiber available in the region 
for further information regarding amounts of revenue  operating profit and loss and other financial information attributable to the pulp business  see item  note  segment information of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
wood products business the company s wood products business involves the manufacture and sale of dimension lumber and boards 
at december   the wood products business  with current estimated annual capacity of approximately billion board feet  operated four sawmills in british columbia and one sawmill in the black hills region of south dakota 
the company is a significant manufacturer of machine stress rated msr lumber  a premium lumber used in roof trusses 
long length lumber  wide width lumber and premium pine appearance grade lumber are also manufactured by the company 
these specialty products command premium prices to standard lumber 
wood chips and other by products of the company s lumber operations are also sold 
during the last three years  revenues from lumber sales were percent or more of total wood products revenues with the balance being wood chips  other residuals and logs 
logs  which are raw material for the company s wood products operations  are obtained through long term cutting licenses on public lands  open log market purchases  competitive bidding from federal agencies and long term contracts on private lands 
canadian operations approximately percent of the company s current lumber capacity is located in british columbia 
the company operates the fort st 
james  castlegar  midway  and grand forks sawmills as well as the fort st 
james  arrow lakes and boundary timber forestry operations in british columbia 
fort st 
james is the company s largest lumber producer  with capacity of over million board feet per production day of primarily spf spruce pine fir 
castlegar also produces a large amount of spf as well as offering a broad mix of western canadian species in various widths and lengths up to feet 
the grand forks and midway mills are significant producers of machine stress rated msr lumber 
approximately percent of the timber requirements for the canadian mills in were obtained from the provincial government of british columbia under long term cutting licenses operating on million acres of public lands with the remaining percent purchased in competitive open log markets 
approximately percent of all timberlands in british columbia are owned by the province of british columbia and administered by the ministry of forests 
a stumpage charge is assessed by the province of british columbia on all government timber that is harvested 
the base stumpage rate charged is determined to meet revenue targets set by the provincial government 
the base rate is adjusted quarterly by the ministry of forests for various factors including recent lumber prices  timber quality  harvesting costs and species mix 
timber harvesting operations are regulated under both the forest and range practices act and under the forest act  which empowers the ministry of forests to grant various forms of timber tenures  including tree farm licenses tfls  timber supply areas tsas  forest licenses fls and timber sale licenses 
the forest and range practices act act  which superseded the forest practices code of british columbia act  became law in january the new act replaced certain administrative requirements involved in forest planning with a results based system that allows licensees to be more flexible in their approach  while achieving required forest responsibilities 
the annual allowable cut aac for timber tenures is determined by the ministry of forests on a sustained yield basis and reflects timber growing conditions  regional and local economic and social interests  and 
table of contents environmental considerations 
cut control periods may not exceed five years 
there are currently no annual minimum cut requirements  however  penalties are applied if the maximum aac for the cut control period generally five years is exceeded by more than ten percent 
the company s aac in increased million cubic meters with the acquisition of fort st 
james and was reduced by million cubic meters from timber take back under the forestry revitalization plan at the beginning of the company s aac is approximately million cubic meters in a tfl is an area based tenure granted for a term of years that is generally replaced every five to ten years for a further year term  subject to satisfactory performance by the licensee of its obligation to manage the area on a sustained yield basis as determined by the ministry of forests 
approximately percent of the company s aac in was derived from two tfls tfl and tfl operating on million acres of timberland 
tfls are considered the most secure form of timber tenure 
the company s two tfls were both replaced effective march  with year terms 
new replacement licenses are expected in march provincial government timberlands that are not designated as tfls are organized into tsas 
fls are issued within each tsa with the overall harvest for the tsa managed by the ministry of forests on a sustained yield basis 
fls are volume based tenures that authorize a specified volume of timber to be cut within a specific tsa 
fls have a term of years and are generally replaceable every five to years for a further year term  subject to satisfactory performance by the licensee of its forest management obligations as determined by the ministry of forests 
the company has two fls that provided approximately percent of the company s aac in the boundary fl  covering a total of  acres  was replaced on december  for a year term 
the fort st 
james fl  covering a total of  acres was obtained on april  for a term of approximately eight and one half years 
the company is in compliance in all material respects with the terms of its forest tenures 
in march  the government of british columbia crown introduced the forestry revitalization plan plan that provides for significant changes to crown forest policy and to the existing allocation of crown timber tenures to licensees 
the changes prescribed in the plan include the elimination of minimum cut control regulations  the elimination of existing timber processing regulations  and the elimination of restrictions limiting the transfer and subdivision of existing licenses 
in addition  the crown legislated that licensees  including the company  were required to return to the crown percent of their annual allowable cut aac in excess of  cubic meters 
the plan stated that approximately half of this volume will be redistributed to open up opportunities for woodlots  community forests and first nations  and the other half will be available for public auction 
the company s aac was reduced by  cubic meters as of the beginning of with a further reduction of  cubic meters expected at the beginning of the timber tenure acquired in with the fort st 
james sawmill had already been reduced under the plan and is not subject to further reduction 
the company expects the reductions in its aac will be made up through market purchases of logs at costs generally consistent with the cost of logs acquired under tenures 
accordingly  the company expects its historical mix of approximately percent tenure acquired logs and percent open market log purchases to shift to a mix of approximately percent tenure acquired logs and percent open market log purchases 
the crown has stated that licensees will be fairly compensated for lost harvesting rights and improvements on crown land  such as roads and bridges  based on the remaining term of the license 
compensation discussions for the loss of harvesting rights were completed in december the company received million for the loss of these rights and recorded a million gain on the transaction 
an advance of million was also received to compensate for the value of the loss of improvements and for costs expected to be incurred for certain deactivation activities on areas taken 
negotiations are ongoing with respect to these items 
in addition  as part of the plan  the crown has proposed to introduce a market based timber pricing system for stumpage fees in the british columbia interior 
the market based timber pricing system was originally targeted to be implemented in  however  it now appears that the provincial government is re evaluating this system with no specific implementation date 
while the company generally believes that a new market based system would result in some increase in stumpage fees compared to the existing system  the company cannot estimate the amount of the potential impact 

table of contents the company s canadian forest operates under an environmental management system and has certification under iso  which is an international standard for environmental systems 
this system provides third party verification that the company is committed to environmental protection of its operating areas  as well as the continual improvement of its performance with regard to the environment 
the company s iso re registration  required every three years  was completed in in  the company was certified to the upgraded iso standard as part of the annual periodic assessment 
furthermore  the company s canadian forest operations  as the result of a rigorous third party audit  were certified that the company has met all of the requirements of the american forest paper association s af pa sustainable forestry initiative sfi program 
the company s sfi program re registration audit for certification was completed in for a five year period 
the sfi program standard includes a land stewardship ethic that integrates the managing  growing  nurturing  harvesting and reforesting and replanting of trees with the conservation of soil  air and water quality  wildlife and fish habitat and aesthetics 
support for and conformity to the sfi program is mandatory for af pa member companies 
us operations approximately percent of the company s current lumber capacity is located in the black hills region of south dakota 
the company s spearfish  south dakota sawmill is the largest producer of lumber in south dakota 
the spearfish mill obtains its timber supply from both public and private lands in the black hills region and is also a participant in american forest and paper association s sustainable forestry initiative sfi program 
the mill produced million board feet of ponderosa pine lumber in  including premium pine appearance grade lumber 
of that volume  approximately percent was dimension lumber and the other percent was pine boards 
from the dimension lumber  the spearfish mill also produces specialty products like exterior log cabin siding and interior paneling 
the spearfish sawmill also produces various by products such as wood chips  bark  sawdust and shavings that are sold to other manufacturers 
at the spearfish site  the company also operates the heartland wood pellet facility 
this facility produces wood pellets for wood pellet stoves and pet bedding 
sales of this product totaled  tons in  compared with  tons in in the black hills  the company obtained approximately percent of its timber requirements in from public sources under long term timber harvesting contracts  percent from private sources under long term harvesting contracts and percent was purchased in competitive open log markets 
canada us trade issues approximately percent of the company s current lumber capacity is located in british columbia  canada 
between april and april  exporters of softwood lumber from canada to the us were subject to tariffs on lumber volumes in excess of defined tariff free volumes under the canada us softwood lumber agreement sla 
upon expiration of the sla on april   petitions for the imposition of antidumping duties add and countervailing duties cvd on softwood lumber from canada were filed with the us department of commerce doc and the us international trade commission itc  by certain us industry and trade groups 
in response to the petitions  the itc conducted an investigation and  in may  determined that the lumber industry in the united states was threatened with material injury by reason of softwood lumber imports from canada 
also in may  the doc determined the cvd deposit rate to be percent and the add deposit rate applicable to the company to be percent  resulting in a combined duty deposit rate of percent on the company s lumber imports from may  to december  as a result of the itc and doc rulings  on may   the company began expensing and making cash deposits of import duties at the combined percent deposit rate  and incurred duties of million in the balance of the company continued to incur import duties in and for nearly all of at the percent deposit rate  and its results included duty costs of million in and million in in december  the doc lowered the duty rates and the company incurred duties for nearly all of at a combined percent rate and its results included duty costs of million in accordingly  the 
table of contents company has made total cash deposits of million with respect to lumber imported into the us from may  to december  a summary of the cvd and add liabilities recorded at december   and and changes during the years then ended is presented as follows thousands beginning balance duties accrued duties deposited ending balance the rulings of the itc and the doc have been appealed by canadian authorities to panels under the north american free trade agreement nafta and of the world trade organization wto 
in august  a nafta panel ruled for the third time that the itc s determination of a threat of material injury from subsidized and dumped imports of canadian softwood lumber was not supported by substantial evidence  and this time remanded the case to the itc with explicit instructions to issue a final determination consistent with the panel s findings 
in september  the itc complied with the nafta panel s order and issued a final decision that the us softwood industry is not threatened with material injury by reason of subject imports from canada 
in so doing  the itc stated for the record that it believed that the nafta panel had exceeded its authority  violated nafta  seriously departed from fundamental rules of procedure  and committed legal error 
in november  the united states government filed an appeal of this final decision with the extraordinary challenge committee ecc provided for under nafta and on august   the ecc upheld the nafta panel ruling 
this decision should have had the effect of invalidating the duties on canadian softwood lumber and requiring the refund of all duties deposited to date  however  the united states continues to dispute the applicability of this decision and canada has filed another lawsuit in the us court of international trade challenging the united states position 
under us law  the add and cvd deposit rates were determined based on historical government subsidies and dumping practices  but the final rates for duties payable on imports during any particular period must be based on government subsidies and dumping during that period 
accordingly  in june  the doc began conducting administrative reviews to determine the cvd and add rates to be applied retroactively to canadian lumber imports during the first review periods  consisting of the period from may  to march  for the cvd and from may  to april  for the add 
similar administrative reviews will be conducted for each subsequent month period 
depending on the results of the administrative reviews  the company may receive refunds of excess cvd and add deposits or be required to make additional cvd and add payments 
doc s finally determined cvd and add rates in any administrative review then become the new deposit rates for subsequent lumber imports 
in december  the doc determined the cvd rate to be percent and the add rate applicable to the company to be percent or a percent combined rate for the first administrative review periods 
this new rate was effective for cash deposits on company shipments beginning december  on january   the doc further reduced the add rate applicable to the company to percent and on february   the doc further reduced the cvd rate to percent  resulting in a combined cash deposit rate for the company of percent 
cash deposits paid by the company on lumber imports during the first administrative review period totaled million in excess of the duties payable at the new rates determined for these periods 
in december  the doc determined the cvd rate to be percent and the add rate applicable to the company to be percent or a combined rate of percent for the second administrative review periods consisting of the period from april  to march  for the cvd and may  through april  
table of contents for the add 
this new rate was effective for cash deposits on company shipments beginning december  cash deposits paid by the company on lumber imports during the second administrative review period totaled million in excess of the duties payable at the new rates determined for these periods 
the canadian government has appealed the first administrative review of the cvd determination to a nafta dispute settlement panel with us industry and trade groups having appealed the add determination to the us court of international trade 
the canadian government has filed a complaint with the nafta secretariat to appeal the results of the second administrative review to a nafta dispute settlement panel 
while the appeals are pending  no refunds of excess cvd or add payments will be made 
the appeal process is likely to take at least two years from initiation to completion  assuming no earlier settlement 
given the uncertainties of the appeal process and ultimate payment of refunds  the company has not recorded a receivable for any potential refunds of duties paid 
various nafta and wto rulings  including those discussed above  have been issued to date  but none of these rulings have become final 
in the event that final rates differ from the deposit rates  ultimate costs will be higher or lower than those recorded to date 
beginning in the second quarter of  both the cvd and add orders will be automatically reviewed in a sunset proceeding to determine whether dumping or a countervailing subsidy would be likely to continue or recur 
the ultimate outcome or effect of nafta and wto reviews  or whether a settlement between the canadian and us governments may be reached  cannot be predicted 
marketing and distribution in  approximately percent of the company s lumber products were sold to wholesalers and distributors  with the remainder sold to remanufacturers and builders 
wood chips produced by the company s sawmills are sold to manufacturers of pulp in the us and canada 
approximately four percent of logs acquired in were sold to other canadian forest products companies 
selling and marketing of the company s wood products is centralized in its portland  oregon office 
although the company does not have distribution facilities at the retail level  the company utilizes several reload facilities around the us to assist in moving the product closer to the customer and holds inventory in a number of customer distribution yards 
the company sold wood products to numerous customers during  none of which accounted for more than percent of consolidated revenues 
backlog the company normally maintains four to six weeks of lumber inventory 
at december   lumber orders were approximately million compared with approximately million at december  this backlog represented an order file for the company that generally would be shipped within a month or is in transit in the us competition the wood products industry is highly competitive  with a large number of companies producing products that are reasonably standardized 
there are numerous competitors of the company that are of comparable size or larger  none of which is believed to be dominant 
the principal means of competition in the company s wood products business are pricing and the ability to satisfy customer demands for various types and grades of lumber

table of contents environmental matters the company is subject to federal  state  provincial and local air  water and land pollution control  solid and hazardous waste management  disposal and remediation laws and regulations in all areas where it has operations 
compliance with these laws and regulations generally requires operating costs as well as capital expenditures 
it is difficult to estimate the costs related solely to environmental matters of many capital projects which have been completed in the past or which may be required in the future 
changes required to comply with environmental standards will affect other areas such as facility life and capacity  production costs  changes in raw material requirements and costs and product value 
the company s estimates of future environmental compliance expenditures are based on its understanding of current standards 
however  the ultimate outcome of future compliance is uncertain due to various factors such as the interpretation of environmental laws  potential introduction of new environmental laws and evolving technologies 
canadian operations the major environmental issues for pulp producers in british columbia are the management of wastewater  air emissions and solid waste in compliance with an extensive body of applicable environmental protection laws and regulations 
the nanaimo and mackenzie mills have comprehensive environmental management programs in place  including modern pollution abatement and control technologies  detailed operating procedures and practices  early warning systems  scheduled equipment inspections and emergency response planning 
regular independent audits ensure that the environmental programs are being implemented effectively and that all regulated requirements are being met 
the mackenzie pulp mill is subject to new particulate emission standards that the british columbia ministry of environment expects the mill to comply with by the fourth quarter of the company performed a feasibility study in to determine the appropriate control devices and equipment configuration necessary to reduce particulate emissions from the mill s power boiler 
the cost of the equipment required to reduce particulate emissions to the new regulatory standard is estimated to be approximately million 
the company has delayed capital spending on this project as a third party is planning to build a co generation wood waste fired power plant in the mackenzie area  subject to obtaining a long term power supply contract from the british columbia hydro and power authority bc hydro 
a decision from bc hydro is expected in the second quarter of and if the contract is approved  this facility is expected to be operational by if built  this facility would allow the company to reduce the operating levels of its power boiler to comply with the new emissions standards while buying the additional required steam from the new facility  thereby eliminating the need for the company to invest in the emissions control equipment 
the company has met with the ministry of environment on this matter  and believes that it will obtain relief from the deadline for compliance with the new emissions standards if bc hydro approves the co generation power contract 
if the co generation project is not approved and if the company does not otherwise obtain relief from compliance  the company can comply with the new emissions standard until it installs the necessary emissions control equipment either by substituting natural gas for a portion of the wood waste component of the power boiler s fuel supply or by curtailing production  depending on the relative economics of pulp and natural gas prices 
legislation has been enacted in british columbia governing the review of operating sites for potential contamination 
if a triggering event occurs in respect of any property that has been used for industrial or commercial purposes the regulations require  among other things  a site profile to be prepared in order to determine whether the site in question is potentially contaminated  in which case remediation may be required under government supervision 
pulp mills are subject to these regulations and past and present owners or operators of mill sites may face remediation costs if contaminated areas are found 
triggering events include the sale of the property or the decommissioning of the mill

the company s exposure to these regulations relates to the company s halsey pulp mill 
compliance with certain portions of the cluster rules was required in and  with other portions required in the epa also promulgated maximum achievable control technology mact requirements for pulp mill combustion sources which required installation of modified particulate emission control equipment 
the installation of this equipment was completed at the halsey mill in at a cost of million 
in  the company completed the installation of equipment required to comply with the portion of the cluster rules that become effective in at a cost of million 
in september  the epa published rules for industrial boiler combustion mact requirements with compliance required by these rules could have affected the company s sawmill located in spearfish  south dakota  where such a boiler is operated

risk factors cautionary language regarding forward looking statements 
this report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these statements include the discussion of our business strategies and expectations concerning future operations  margins  profitability  liquidity and capital resources 
in addition  in certain portions of this report  the words anticipate  believe  estimate  may  will  expect  plan and intend and similar expressions  as they relate to us or our management  are intended to identify forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results  performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward looking statements 
these statements are based upon the current expectations and assumptions of  and on information available to  our management 
further  investors are cautioned that  unless required by law  we do not assume any obligation to update forward looking statements based on unanticipated events or changed expectations 
in addition to specific factors that may be described in connection with any particular forward looking statement  factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward looking statements include but are not limited to the following we have required waivers to maintain compliance with financial covenants and must refinance our halsey pulp mill leases  and could face defaults if we are unable to do so 
certain of our debt agreements contain customary conditions to borrowing  including compliance with financial covenants relating to maximum leverage ratios  net worth tests  minimum interest coverage ratios and minimum liquidity amounts 
as of december   we would have been in violation of two financial covenants under our halsey pulp mill leases  except that on december   we entered into amendments pursuant to which the other parties to the halsey leases waived compliance with the covenants 
the halsey leases include early repurchase options pursuant to which we may repurchase the halsey mill on january  for an aggregate repurchase price of million 
under the lease amendments signed on december   the covenant waivers expire as of september  if we haven t given irrevocable notice of exercise of the early repurchase options by that date 
accordingly  we face likely defaults if we do not refinance the million repurchase price by january  as of march   we expect to be out of compliance with a covenant under our canadian revolving credit facility and  accordingly  on march   we obtained a waiver from the lenders 
this facility expires in july and  unless renewed or replaced  will convert into two term loans at that time and be unavailable for further revolving borrowings 
we also expect to be out of compliance with covenants under our us revolving credit facility at march   and therefore have obtained a waiver from that lender as well 
compliance with covenants under our revolving credit facilities  or waivers  is necessary for 
table of contents us to comply with the new quarterly million minimum liquidity covenant under the halsey leases 
while we do not expect to be out of compliance with financial covenants at june   if our second quarter financial results are worse than expected  we could be out of compliance 
any failure by us to comply with applicable covenants and early purchase obligations  or to obtain waivers therefrom  would result in an event of default with respect to  and could result in the acceleration of  a portion of our debt  which  in turn  could lead to our inability to pay our debts 
our independent auditors have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
in connection with our financial statements our independent registered public accounting firm issued an unqualified opinion containing an explanatory paragraph that states that we have significant borrowings which require compliance with financial covenants subject to quarterly measurement and have suffered recurring losses  which raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
our financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern  which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business 
the financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and the amount and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern 
the fact that this opinion has been issued could have material adverse effects on our business  results of operations and cash flows  by causing parties we deal with to question our financial ability to perform our obligations 
for example  one or more of our suppliers could decide not to sell to us or impose restrictive sales terms 
financial uncertainty also could affect our relationships with customers  employees and others 
our indebtedness could reduce our ability to use cash flow for purposes other than debt service or otherwise restrict our activities 
our total debt as a percentage of total capitalization at december  was percent 
this leverage  or higher leverage if we were to incur additional indebtedness  could have important consequences 
for example  it could make it difficult to obtain any necessary future financing for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service requirements or other purposes 
our high level of leverage requires a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to satisfy debt service requirements  thereby reducing our ability to use cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures  development projects  acquisitions  dividends and other general corporate purposes 
high leverage also limits flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in business and increases vulnerability to a downturn in the business and general adverse economic and industry conditions 
exchange rate fluctuations have harmed and could continue to harm our operating results and cash flows 
although our sales are made primarily in us dollars  the majority of our operating costs and expenses are incurred in canadian dollars 
significant variations in relative currency values  particularly a significant increase in the value of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar  adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 
a substantial portion of our pulp customer base is in europe  asia and other non us markets 
as such  the value of the us dollar as compared to foreign currencies directly affects our customers ability to pay and our relative competitive cost position with other regions pulps 
any significant exchange rate fluctuation could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operation 
for example  a change in the canadian to us dollar translation rate from to would decrease pre tax income as measured in us dollars by an estimated million on an annual basis 
fluctuations in our product prices and demand could harm our operating results and cash flows 
our financial performance depends primarily on the prices we receive for our products 
prices for both pulp and lumber products are highly cyclical and have fluctuated significantly in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future 
increases or decreases in production capacity  increases or decreases in operating rates and changes in customer consumption patterns will cause changes in product prices 
the economic climate of each region where our products are sold has a significant impact on the demand  and therefore the prices  for pulp 
table of contents and lumber 
changes in regional economies can cause fluctuation in prices and sales volumes and  as a result  directly affect our profitability and cash flows 
the continued uncertainties in the economic conditions of the united states and other international markets could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 
the amount of downtime that our mills take fluctuates based on changes in pricing and demand for our products 
any future downward fluctuation in prices could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our markets are highly competitive 
our products are sold primarily in the united states  europe  canada and asia 
the markets for our products are highly competitive on a global basis  with a number of major companies competing in each market with no company holding a dominant position 
for both lumber and pulp  a large number of companies produce products that are reasonably standardized  therefore  the traditional basis for competition has been price 
other competitive factors are quality of product  reliability of supply and customer service 
in recent years  we have experienced increased competition and pricing pressure from new low cost hardwood pulp producers in south america 
because of greater resources  many of our competitors may be able to make greater investments in technology or other cost cutting improvements  adapt more quickly to industrial changes or devote greater resources to the sale of their products 
we cannot assure that we will be able to compete successfully against such competitors 
we face significant fees on lumber imports into the united states 
in may  the us international trade commission  or itc  imposed duties on certain types of softwood lumber imported into the united states from canada after determining that imports of certain types of softwood lumber from canada threatened us softwood lumber mill operators 
based on findings of the us department of commerce  or doc  regarding subsidies and dumping margins  the itc s decision has subjected our imports of certain types of softwood lumber from canada  on or after may   to these duties which have had a material adverse effect on our wood products business results of operations and cash flows 
various nafta and wto rulings have been issued to date in canada s appeals of these duties  and these rulings are subject to further appeals 
in the event that final rates differ from the depository rates  ultimate costs may be higher or lower than those recorded to date 
the ultimate outcome or effect of nafta and wto reviews  or whether a settlement between the canadian and us governments may be reached  cannot be predicted 
our operations require substantial capital  and we may not have adequate capital resources to meet all of our capital requirements 
our businesses are capital intensive  and we regularly incur capital expenditures to expand our operations  maintain our equipment  increase our operating efficiency and comply with environmental laws 
our total capital expenditures were approximately million in  and we expect to spend approximately million on capital expenditures during if we require additional financing to fund capital expenditures  we may not be able to obtain it on favorable terms  or at all 
in addition  our debt service obligations reduce our available cash flows 
if we cannot maintain or upgrade our equipment or ensure environmental compliance  we could be required to cease or curtail some of our manufacturing operations  or we may become unable to manufacture our products at costs or quality that can compete effectively in one or more of our markets 
we are subject to extensive environmental regulation 
our pulp and lumber operations are subject to a variety of national and local laws and regulations  many of which deal with the environment 
these laws and regulations impose stringent standards on our operations regarding  among other things  air emissions  water discharges  use and handling of hazardous materials  use  handling and disposal of waste and remediation of environmental contamination 
changes in these laws or regulations have in the past  and could in the future  require us to make substantial expenditures in order to comply  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and cash flows 

table of contents we may be subject to environmental liabilities that could require substantial expenditures 
we are currently participating in the investigation and remediation of environmental contamination at two sites on which we previously conducted business 
in addition  we are working with the ministry of environment in british columbia regarding environmental contamination at the mackenzie mill 
we may also be required to investigate and remediate environmental conditions at other sites if contamination  presently unknown to us  is discovered 
the ultimate cost to us for site remediation and monitoring of these sites cannot be predicted with certainty due to the difficulties in estimating the ultimate cost of remediation and determining the extent to which contributions will be available from other parties 
expenditures that may be required in connection with these sites could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the availability and pricing of the raw materials we use are subject to fluctuations  which could increase our expenses 
logs  wood chips and sawdust  the principal raw materials used in the manufacture of our products  are purchased in highly competitive  price sensitive markets 
these raw materials have historically exhibited price and demand cyclicality 
supply and price of these raw materials are dependent upon a variety of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
changes in the pricing of logs under british columbia s current stumpage system as the result of negotiations to resolve the us canada lumber import duty issue could affect the cost of logs for our canadian sawmills 
other factors include changing environmental and conservation regulations and natural disasters  such as forest fires  infestations  wind storms or other extreme weather conditions 
a decrease in the supply of logs  wood chips and sawdust can cause higher raw material costs and  as a result  material fluctuations in our results of operations and cash flows 
our nanaimo pulp mill s long term fiber supply agreement with weyerhaeuser was assumed by cascadia forest products ltd cascadia  a wholly owned subsidiary of brascan corporation  in may  concurrent with the sale of weyerhaeuser s coastal sawmill and timberlands 
the contract allows us to acquire million cubic meters of fiber per year through our mackenzie pulp mill purchases approximately percent of its fiber requirements from sawmills primarily located in mackenzie  british columbia and operated by canfor 
fiber is purchased at market or at prices determined under a formula intended to reflect market value of the fiber 
the failure by cascadia or canfor to produce the required fiber pursuant to these contracts could have a material adverse effect on us 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain an adequate supply of softwood fiber for our pulp operations from these or alternate suppliers 
we are subject to canadian forest management policies and regulations that could harm our supply and cost of logs 
in march  the government of british columbia  or crown  introduced the forestry revitalization plan  or plan  that provides for significant changes to crown forest policy and to the existing allocation of crown timber tenures to licensees 
the changes prescribed in the plan include the elimination of minimum cut control regulations  the elimination of existing timber processing regulations  and the elimination of restrictions limiting the transfer and subdivision of existing licenses 
in addition  the crown has legislated that licensees  including us  are required to return to the crown percent of their annual allowable cut or aac  in excess of  cubic meters 
as a result  we anticipate that our historical mix of approximately percent tenure acquired logs and percent open market log purchases will shift to a mix of approximately percent tenure acquired logs and percent open market log purchases 
our aac has been reduced by  cubic meters as of the beginning of and we expect a further reduction of  cubic meters at the beginning of the timber tenure acquired in with the fort st 
james sawmill had already been reduced under the plan and is not subject to further reduction 
although we expect the reductions in our aac to be made up through market purchases of logs at costs generally consistent with the cost of logs acquired under tenures  and our average purchased log costs have been slightly lower than our tenure acquired log costs for the last three years  there is uncertainty as to the impact our aac reduction will have on the supply and cost of purchased logs available to us 
accordingly  
table of contents we cannot assure you that our increased dependence on purchased logs will not have an adverse affect on our results of operations and cash flows 
in addition  as part of the plan  the crown has proposed to introduce a market based timber pricing system for stumpage fees in the british columbia interior 
the market based timber pricing system was originally targeted to be implemented in  however  it now appears that the provincial government is re evaluating this system with no specific implementation date 
while we generally believe that a new market based system would result in some increase in stumpage fees compared to the existing system  we cannot estimate the amount of the potential impact 
we depend on third parties for transportation services 
we rely primarily on third parties for transportation of the products we manufacture and distribute  as well as for delivery of our raw materials 
in particular  a significant portion of the goods we manufacture and raw materials we use are transported by railroad  trucks  and ships 
if any of our third party transportation providers were to fail to deliver the goods we manufacture or distribute in a timely manner  we may be unable to sell those products at full value  or at all 
similarly  if any of these providers were to fail to deliver raw materials to us in a timely manner  we may be unable to manufacture our products in response to customer demand 
in addition  if any of these third parties were to cease operations or cease doing business with us  we may be unable to replace them at reasonable cost 
any failure of a third party transportation provider to deliver raw materials or finished products in a timely manner could harm our reputation  negatively impact our customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 
a material disruption at one of our facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand  reduce our sales and negatively impact our net income 
one or more of our major pulp mills or sawmills  or one of its larger machines within an otherwise operational facility  could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events  including prolonged power failures  an equipment failure  a chemical spill or release  explosion of a boiler  the effect of a drought or reduced rainfall on water supply  disruptions in the transportation infrastructure  including roads  bridges  railroad tracks and tunnels  fires  floods  earthquakes  or other catastrophes  terrorism or threats of terrorism  labor difficulties  or other operational problems 
any such downtime or facility damage could prevent us from meeting customer demand for our products and or require us to make unplanned capital expenditures 
if our relationships with our union employees were to deteriorate  we could be faced with labor shortages  disruptions or stoppages  which could adversely affect our business and reduce operating margins and income 
approximately percent of our employees are paid on an hourly basis and most of these employees are covered under collective bargaining agreements 
if we were unable to reach agreement on the terms of any collective bargaining agreement with any group of our employees  we could be subject to work slowdowns or stoppages 
an increase in the cost of our purchased energy would lead to higher manufacturing costs  which could adversely affect our operating results 
energy is vital to our operations and is one of our significant raw materials 
we estimate that energy comprised approximately ten percent of the cost of sales of the pulp segment and approximately three percent of the cost of sales of the wood products segment during and energy prices  particularly for electricity and natural gas  have been volatile in recent years and currently exceed historical averages 
these fluctuations impact our manufacturing costs and contribute to earnings volatility 
increases in the cost of purchased energy have adversely affected  and further increases in such costs could further adversely affect  our operating results and cash flows 

table of contents our forest operations may be adversely affected by first nations people s claims to canadian land 
our canadian forest operations are primarily carried out on public forestlands under forest licenses 
many of these lands are subject to the constitutionally protected treaty or common law rights of the first nations people of canada 
first nations groups in british columbia have made claims of ownership or interests in substantial portions of land in the province and are seeking compensation from the government with respect to these claims 
the supreme court of canada has held that the first nations groups have a spectrum of aboriginal rights in lands that have been traditionally used or occupied by their ancestors 
the court s decision did not apply to any particular lands and was stated in general terms 
the court held that aboriginal rights and title are not absolute and may be infringed upon by government in furtherance of a legislative objective  including forestry  subject to meeting a justification test and being consistent with the fiduciary relationship between government and first nations groups 
to address the claims of the first nations groups  the governments of canada and british columbia instituted a negotiation process under the administration of a treaty commission 
in july  the voting public approved a referendum of principles for treaty making 
this gave provincial negotiators the authority to negotiate and make commitments on topics that are consistent with the referendum principles and for which current policies exist 
any settlements that may result from the negotiation process may involve a combination of cash and resources and grants of conditional rights to gather food on public lands and some rights of self government 
the issues surrounding aboriginal rights and title are not likely to be resolved by the canadian governments in the near future 
in november  the supreme court of canada confirmed that the crown has a duty to consult with first nations when the crown has knowledge  real or constructive  of the potential existence of an aboriginal right or title and contemplates conduct that might adversely impact it 
the consultation process required by the court is currently not clearly defined  creating some uncertainty regarding crown processes for grants and renewals of timber tenures 
if significant areas of canada are found by the courts to be subject to aboriginal title  the company s forest tenures and its ability to harvest timber from those tenures could be materially adversely affected 
a reduction in the timber supply could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  cash flows and results of operations

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company s financial performance declined in as a result of lower market prices for both pulp and lumber and a weaker us dollar which increased reported pulp and wood products manufacturing costs that are incurred primarily in canadian dollars 
import duties on canadian softwood lumber continued to adversely affect results  but at lower rates than experienced in in addition  the company recorded a valuation allowance against its us deferred tax assets resulting in a million expense in the fourth quarter of the company lost million in on revenues of million  compared with net income of million in on revenues of million and a net loss of million in on revenues of million

financial leverage the company s total debt to total capitalization ratio was percent at december  compared with percent at december  and percent at september  the increases in the debt ratio were primarily due to an increase in total debt of million during and million during the fourth quarter of the company s primary cash requirements in included million for the purchase of the fort st 
james sawmill  million for capital expenditures  million for operating activities and million for the payment of cash dividends 
cash requirements in the fourth quarter of included million for capital expenditures  a million net reduction in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities  and a million seasonal increase in log inventories at the company s sawmills 
as of december   the company would have been in violation of two financial covenants under its halsey pulp mill leases  except that on december   the company entered into amendments pursuant to which the other parties to the halsey leases waived compliance with the covenants 
the halsey leases include early repurchase options pursuant to which the company may repurchase the halsey mill on january  for an aggregate repurchase price of million 
under the lease amendments signed on december   the covenant waivers expire as of september  if the company hasn t given irrevocable notice of exercise of the early repurchase options by that date 
accordingly  the company likely faces defaults if it does not refinance the million repurchase price by january  the lease amendments also impose a new liquidity covenant under which the company must have cash balances plus borrowing availability under credit facilities of at least million as of the end of each quarter 
to meet this liquidity requirement at march   the company expects to rely on borrowing availability under its revolving credit agreement with a us lender 
borrowing availability under that credit agreement is dependent on compliance with quarterly maximum leverage ratio and minimum net worth covenants 
the company does not expect to be in compliance with these covenants at march   and therefore has obtained a waiver of these covenants from the lender 
in addition  the company and the lender agreed to modify these covenants so that on june  and future quarterly compliance dates  the company will be required to have a maximum ratio of total debt to total capitalization of percent and a minimum consolidated stockholders equity of million 
the company s canadian revolving credit agreement requires  among other things  that the company s canadian subsidiaries maintain a ratio of adjusted ebitda to interest expense of at least to measured at the end of each quarter for the four quarter period then ended 
for the year ended december   this ratio for the canadian subsidiaries was to  and the company does not expect to satisfy this covenant requirement for the period ending march  accordingly  on march   the company obtained a waiver of compliance with this covenant as of march  from its canadian banks 
this waiver was conditioned on the company s agreement to forthwith pledge its unencumbered canadian sawmills as additional security 
in addition  the canadian 
table of contents revolving credit facility expires on july  and  if not renewed or repaid  outstanding borrowings at that time will convert into two term loans payable in one year 
the company is in negotiations with certain institutional lenders to refinance its halsey pulp mill leases and existing canadian and us revolving credit facilities 
the company expects more of any refinanced debt to be term debt at long term rates  and that the average interest rate on any new debt will be substantially higher than the average rate paid on the debt being refinanced 
the company cannot provide any assurance that it will be successful in obtaining new debt financing on acceptable terms or at all

the company s board of directors believes it desirable for the company to issue additional common stock to improve its capital structure and  subject to market conditions  the company may offer common stock in the future under the shelf registration 
exchange rate fluctuations the majority of the company s pulp and wood products businesses are managed within the company s canadian subsidiaries 
the company s sales of pulp and lumber are made primarily in us dollars and the vast majority of its canadian subsidiaries expenses are incurred in canadian dollars 
a weakening us dollar relative to the canadian dollar increases the reported pulp and wood products manufacturing costs of the canadian subsidiaries 
the canadian to us dollar average exchange rate of for the year was eight percent higher and percent higher than the and rates for the years and  respectively 
the company estimates that the change in the canadian to us dollar exchange rate from to increased cost of goods by approximately million and the change in the canadian to us dollar exchange rate from to increased cost of goods by approximately million 
the company manages a portion of its exposure to the effects of a fluctuating currency exchange rate between the us and canadian dollar by using foreign exchange contracts  but historically has not entered into long term contracts with respect to exposure from its operations in canada and the amount hedged at year end was not material 
fees on lumber imports into the united states with approximately percent of the company s current lumber capacity located in british columbia  the contentious issues surrounding the importation of softwood lumber from canada into the us have had a significant impact on the results of operations and cash flows from the company s wood products business 
during the five year period ending march   the company conducted business under the quota based canada us softwood lumber agreement 
shortly after expiration of that agreement  the us department of commerce doc instituted countervailing and anti dumping duties on softwood lumber produced by canadian mills and imported into the us cash deposits of duties began in may  and the company has deposited a total of million with respect to lumber imported into the us from may  to december  the cash deposit rate for the company s lumber imports from may  to december  was percent 
as a result of an administrative review by the doc completed in december  the company s cash deposit rate on lumber imports for most of was reduced to percent 
a second administrative review by the doc completed in december further reduced the cash deposit rate on the company s lumber imports to percent effective december  lumber import duties totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively  and are expected to decline significantly in as a result of the reduced duty rate

table of contents cyclical product pricing one of the most significant factors in the company s financial performance is the price it receives for its products 
the company s pulp products are sold primarily in europe  north america and asia  and prices are affected by many factors such as global economic conditions  producer inventory levels  existing and future production capacity and currency fluctuations 
improved economic conditions  a weakening us dollar  relatively balanced nbsk producer inventory levels and an increase in pulp consumption by china led to a steady rise in pulp sales prices in which continued through the first half of pulp prices decreased in the second half of and further declined in until stabilizing in the fourth quarter of the following chart illustrates the annual average gross real prices of nbsk pulp delivered into northern europe for the last years logo from near cyclical lows in  lumber prices significantly improved and peaked in the third quarter of and then declined until the fourth quarter of when prices began to improve 
prices for the company s lumber products  sold primarily in the us  are affected by factors such as the general economic climate in the us  the level of interest rates  the rate of housing starts and level of remodeling activity in the us  and production capacity relative to demand in the lumber industry 
the company has continued a program of focusing on value added products which obtain premium prices in the market for lumber products 
despite record levels of housing starts in the us during  lumber prices were low primarily due to excess lumber production capacity in north america  until the pickup in us economic growth that occurred in the second half of and continued through interest rates in and were at historically low levels 
the federal reserve systematically increased short term interest rates in and 
table of contents the following chart illustrates the annual average real prices of western spruce pine fir spf lumber for the last years logo the company s earnings are highly leveraged to pulp and lumber prices and could be significantly affected by future price fluctuations 
for example  assuming other costs remain constant  using s shipments of approximately  metric tons of pulp  a per metric ton price improvement would result in annual additional pre tax income of approximately million 
similarly  using s lumber shipments of approximately  thousand board feet and assuming other costs remain constant  a per thousand board feet price improvement would result in additional annual pre duty and pre tax income of approximately million 
in the first quarter of  both pulp and lumber prices have increased over fourth quarter levels 
cost management the company continues to focus on efforts to improve its cost structure through targeted cost reduction programs and disciplined capital spending

on january   the company announced that it would continue to operate the midway sawmill on a reduced basis after march  estimated costs of the original closure plan totaled approximately million and have been significantly reduced 
as a result of the changed plans  the company recorded million of employee termination costs and million of accelerated depreciation in wood products cost of sales in the fourth quarter of in february  the company reached an agreement with the union regarding early retirement or other severance benefits for hourly employees

this taxable gain will be offset by us net operating loss carryforwards that otherwise would have expired in and  resulting in a million decrease in the company s balance of us deferred tax assets 
because of the inter company nature of the sale  the million in income tax expense for book purposes was deferred and recorded as a deferred charge on the balance sheet as of december  this deferred charge will be amortized over the book life of the transferred assets  which is estimated to be years 
the sale also resulted in a million increase in the basis of the transferred assets for the canadian subsidiary 
as that increased basis is depreciated in canada over the life of the assets  there will be an annual benefit that is expected to approximately offset the deferred charge amortization each year 
accordingly  this transaction is expected to result in an overall minimal effect on the company s earnings over time while effectively utilizing us deferred tax assets in results of operations compared with pulp revenues from the company s pulp business totaled million in compared with million in  an increase of percent

another significant factor affecting wood products cost of sales was the average exchange rate used to translate operating costs of the company s canadian lumber operations from canadian dollars to us dollars 
the company estimates that the increase in the average daily canadian to us dollar exchange rate from to resulted in an approximately million increase in wood products cost of sales  or a five percent increase in the average cost per thousand board feet of lumber sold in the remaining increase in the average cost of lumber sold related to higher plant production and freight costs and to higher log and logging costs primarily as the result of logs acquired under higher priced timber contracts in the us lumber operations

the state tax adjustments in were related to the company s recognition of deferred state tax liabilities on undistributed earnings of one of its canadian subsidiaries and the release of related state tax valuation allowances and tax reserves 
during the course of the audit of the company s financial statements  it was determined that the company had miscalculated the required deferred taxes on undistributed earnings of its canadian subsidiaries for the years through accordingly  the company recorded a deferred state income tax liability of million on all undistributed earnings of a canadian subsidiary and made an assessment that previously recorded valuation allowances and tax reserves related to its ability to realize state net operating loss carryforwards totaling million were no longer required  for a net credit to the tax provision of million 
the amounts relating to prior years were recorded in the fourth quarter of as those amounts were determined to be immaterial to all affected periods

net cash used for operating activities was million in the fourth quarter of total inventory decreased by million in the quarter as the company managed its inventories to conserve cash 
decreases in finished pulp and lumber inventories and pulp raw material inventories were partially offset by a million seasonal increase in log inventories at the company s sawmills 
the normal seasonal pattern for the company requires a build of log inventories during the fourth and first quarters to allow the company s sawmills to operate without interruption during the break up period each spring when northern forests thaw and muddy conditions curtail logging operations for one to two months 
also contributing to the use of cash for operating activities in the fourth quarter were a million pre tax loss for the quarter including million of non cash depreciation and amortization  a million increase in accounts receivable due to higher volumes and prices  and a million net reduction in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities due to the payment in the fourth quarter of accrued costs for the annual maintenance shutdowns of the mackenzie and halsey pulp mills and accrued interest on the outstanding notes and debentures and otherwise generally due to the timing of settlements of accounts payable

financial outlook on november   the company s board of directors suspended the quarterly dividend to conserve the company s net worth and cash balances 
the company is also managing its working capital  including inventories and accounts payable  to conserve cash 
while the company expects to incur a net loss in the first quarter of  cash flow in to date is benefiting from higher pulp and lumber prices and reduced duty payments  offset by the further strengthening of the canadian dollar 
however  as discussed above  the company does not expect to be in compliance with certain covenants under its canadian and us revolving credit facilities at march   and has obtained waivers of these covenant violations from its lenders 
the company does not currently expect to be out of compliance with covenants under its revolving credit facilities at june   however  if second quarter financial results are worse than expected  covenant compliance could become an issue 
without compliance with or waivers of financial covenants under its revolving credit facilities  the company will be unable to meet its million liquidity requirement under the halsey leases 
in their opinion on the company s financial statements  the company s independent registered public accounting firm expressed substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern  due to the company s recent losses and inability to comply with financial covenants  combined with uncertainty over the company s ability to refinance or renew maturing debt and comply with financial covenants in future periods 
to address the refinancing and existing covenant issues  the company is in negotiations with certain institutional lenders to refinance its halsey pulp mill leases and existing canadian and us revolving credit facilities 
the company expects that the new credit facility will not include net worth or leverage covenants  but will include minimum ebitda covenants 
the company also expects more of any refinanced debt to be term debt at long term rates  and that the average interest rate on any new debt will be substantially higher than the average rate paid on the debt being refinanced 
the company is seeking flexibility to use any duty refunds it may ultimately receive to prepay portions of any such debt without penalty 
if the current negotiations are not successful  the company will pursue other sources of debt financing believed to be available 
if necessary  the company will seek additional waivers of covenant requirements which it believes will continue to be granted as long as prospects for a refinancing remain positive 
however  the company cannot provide any assurance that it will be successful in obtaining new debt financing on acceptable terms or at all 
the company will also consider possible asset sales to generate cash and reduce debt  or potential equity issuances to generate cash and improve the balance sheet 
in considering alternatives  the company is also cognizant of the possibility of a negotiated settlement of the canada us softwood lumber dispute which could result in the refund to the company of a substantial portion of the cash import duties deposited by the company since million as of december  
the company s continuation as a going concern is ultimately dependent upon its future financial performance  which will be affected by general economic  competitive and other factors  including those discussed under item a risk factors  many of which are beyond the company s control 
there can be no assurance that the company s plans to ensure continuation as a going concern will be successful

table of contents critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are disclosed in item  note  accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
the company s management routinely makes judgments and estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
as the number of variables and assumptions affecting the probable future resolution of the uncertainties increase  these judgments become even more subjective and complex 
the company has identified certain accounting policies  described below  which are important to the portrayal of the company s current financial condition and results of operations and require subjective judgments in the application thereof 
deferred taxes deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences  net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards if it is more likely than not that the tax benefits will be realized 
judgment is applied in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part 
the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for valuation allowances 
the company has recorded a valuation allowance to reduce its us deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in the event the company was to determine that it would be able to realize its us deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to decrease the valuation allowance would increase income in the period in which such determination was made 
also  if the company was to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to increase the valuation allowance on such net deferred tax assets would be charged to expense in the period such determination was made 
the company has implemented certain tax planning strategies to generate taxable income in the us to utilize net operating loss carryforwards that might otherwise expire 
the principal tax planning strategy involves the potential future repatriation from a canadian subsidiary of income taxed at a rate in canada lower than us tax rates 
this strategy depends on the generation over time of sufficient income by canadian operating subsidiaries 
the strategy would also be disadvantaged if ongoing losses are incurred in the us which prevent the company from using the repatriated earnings to realize available net operating loss carryforwards 
at december   the company had total deferred tax assets of million 
included in this total were us federal and state deferred tax assets of million 
us net operating losses are the most significant component of the us deferred tax assets 
as a result of cumulative losses at the canadian subsidiaries over the last three years  the company cannot determine that it is more likely than not that it will generate sufficient income to utilize all of the deferred tax assets 
therefore a valuation allowance was established at december  this resulted in a reduction of the net balance of deferred tax assets from million to million and reduced the net balance of us federal and state deferred tax assets from million to million 
the realization of the remaining deferred tax asset is not assured  and the need to record additional valuation allowances against us deferred tax assets could result if the estimated benefits realizable from tax planning strategies are reduced 
impairment of long lived assets the company periodically evaluates long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in performing the review of recoverability  the company estimates future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
the estimates of future cash flows  based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections  require management s subjective judgments 
the time periods for estimating future cash flows is often lengthy  which increases the sensitivity to assumptions made 
changes in any of these estimates could have a material effect on the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the long lived asset 
to date  these evaluations have not resulted in an impairment charge for any of the company s assets 

table of contents the key assumptions in estimating these cash flows are future pricing of commodity products  future estimates of expenses to be incurred  future foreign exchange rates and future capital expenditures 
the assumptions regarding pricing are based on price projections estimated from information gathered from industry research firms  research reports published by investment analysts and other published forecasts 
the company s estimates of future expenses are based on internal planning models and the expectation that the company will generally continue to reduce production costs that will offset the effects of inflation 
due to the numerous variables associated with the company s judgments and assumptions relating to the estimates of future cash flows and the effects of changes in circumstances affecting the valuation of assets  both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates are subject to the uncertainties discussed above 
as additional information becomes available  the company may be required to change the estimates it uses in subsequent impairment evaluations 
pension and other postretirement benefits the company sponsors several qualified and nonqualified pension and postretirement benefit plans for its employees 
the company uses a september measurement date for plan assets and liabilities 
key assumptions used to determine the amounts recorded in the company s financial statements include the discount rate  the expected return on plan assets  anticipated trends in health care costs  assumed increases in salaries  mortality rates and other factors 
the company s discount rate assumption is based on the rates of return on high quality bonds with maturities that are consistent with projected future plan cash flows 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is based on historical and projected average rates of return for current and planned asset classes in the plan s investment portfolios 
these assumptions are reviewed with external actuaries annually on the plan measurement date and are updated as appropriate 
actual experience that differs from the assumptions could have a significant effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
at december   the company had a prepaid pension cost asset of million related to its us pension plan 
at september   the fair value of us pension plan assets exceeded the company s accumulated benefit obligation abo by million 
if the fair value of plan assets were to fall below the plan s calculated abo and the company chose not to make a cash contribution to plan assets at least equal to the difference between the abo and the fair value of plan assets  this prepaid pension cost asset would be written off  net of taxes  by a direct charge to shareholders equity  with no impact on earnings or cash 
the most significant variables that could cause this to occur are the actual return on plan assets and the discount rate used on the measurement date to value plan liabilities 
at september   the company reduced its expected rate of return used for its canadian plans  with the weighted average rate of return on plan assets for us and canadian plans decreasing to percent from percent at september  each percent reduction in the expected return on assets is expected to increase estimated pension expense by approximately million 
at september   the company also reduced the discount rate used for its us and canadian plans  with the weighted average discount rate decreasing to percent from percent at september  pension and postretirement benefit costs for will be based on the percent assumed discount rate 
based on estimated expenses  each percent reduction in the assumed discount rate is expected to increase pension and postretirement benefit costs by approximately million 
environmental matters the company is required to make estimates of the costs of remediation for certain contaminated former and currently operated mill sites 
the ultimate costs to the company for the investigation  remediation and monitoring of these sites cannot be predicted with certainty due to the often unknown magnitude of the pollution or the necessary cleanup  the varying costs of alternative cleanup methods  the amount of time necessary to obtain 
table of contents regulatory approvals and to accomplish such cleanups and the evolving nature of cleanup technologies and governmental regulations 
due to the numerous variables  some of which are beyond the company s control  associated with these judgments and assumptions  both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates of the related contingencies are subject to substantial uncertainties 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  when the estimate of a probable loss is a range  the minimum amount in the range is accrued when no estimate within the range is better than another 
in making these judgments and assumptions  the company considers  among other things  the activity to date at particular sites and information obtained through consultation with applicable regulatory authorities and third party consultants and contractors 
the company has also considered the obligation or willingness and ability of third parties to bear an allocated or proportionate share of the cost of these activities  but currently assumes it will bear the entire cost of remediation at these sites 
the company has recognized liabilities for environmental remediation costs for these sites in amounts that it believes are probable and reasonably estimable 
the company regularly monitors its exposure to environmental loss contingencies and  as additional information becomes available  the estimates may change 
the company has recognized environmental remediation expense benefit of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the company spent million  million and million on environmental remediation in  and  respectively  which amounts were charged against the environmental reserves accrued 
as of december   the company had recorded estimated liabilities totaling million for environmental matters 
in each case  amounts are based on the assumption that the remedial actions currently proposed by the company will be approved by the applicable government agency or are otherwise sufficient to remediate the sites 
based on currently available information and analysis  the company estimates that for one site where a remediation plan has not been approved by the regulatory agency  it is reasonably possible that up to million of additional remediation costs could be incurred if further site testing reveals more extensive environmental contamination or if the regulatory agency otherwise requires more extensive remediation 
reforestation approximately percent of the company s current lumber capacity is located in the canadian province of british columbia 
the company primarily obtains its timber from the provincial government of british columbia under timber harvesting licenses 
under these licenses  the company is responsible for all reforestation costs such as site preparation  planting  fertilizing  thinning and herbicide application until the harvested land requires no further reforestation activity prior to the next harvest 
the company estimates reforestation costs based on its substantial experience in reforestation in british columbia under the province s forestry regulations 
a significant portion of the reforestation costs occur during the first five years after harvest 
the remaining costs are incurred until the harvested land is free to grow  generally seven to twelve years after initial planting 
whereas it is possible to reasonably estimate the costs of labor and materials required for reforestation activities  it is not possible to predict the impact of natural disasters  such as windstorms  droughts and forest fires  or the possibility of changes in the province s regulations 
due to the numerous variables associated with these judgments and assumptions  and the effects of governmental regulation  weather and forest fires  both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates of the related liabilities are subject to uncertainties 
as additional information becomes available  the estimates may change 
at december   the company s total reforestation liability was million 
the company recognized expenses related to reforestation activities of million  million and million for the years  and  respectively 
cash expenditures for reforestation activities totaled million  million and million for the same periods 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial market risk the company s exposure to market risk for interest rates relates primarily to short and long term debt 
the company s investment in marketable securities at december  and was not significant 
the company s debt is percent fixed rate with percent of total debt at variable rates at december   and therefore  interest expense could be affected when market interest rates change 

table of contents the company has exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk due to its significant operations in canada 
for the company  a weakening of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar has a positive effect on the cost of operating in canada but has a negative foreign currency translation effect on the company s net investment in canadian operations 
the company s net investment in canadian subsidiaries is not hedged 
the net assets of canadian subsidiaries translated into us dollars using the period end exchange rates were approximately million at december  the potential change in fair value resulting from a hypothetical percent change in the canadian to us exchange rate would be approximately million at december  any gain or loss in fair value would be reflected as a cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment 
the change in fair value would not affect cash flows or reported net income or loss of the company  but would increase or decrease accumulated other comprehensive income which is a component of stockholders equity 
the company is exposed to foreign currency transaction gains and losses primarily in the translation of us dollar denominated cash and accounts receivable of its canadian subsidiaries 
the company periodically uses foreign exchange contracts to manage a portion of its exposure to foreign currency transactions 
the notional value of foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding at december  and was million and million  respectively 
the company utilizes well defined financial contracts in the normal course of its operations as a means to manage certain commodity price risks 
the majority of these contracts are either fixed price or index priced contracts for future purchases of energy  primarily natural gas and electricity 
when contracts do not meet the amended definition of normal purchases or normal sales they are recorded at fair value 
as of december   the company had purchased forward natural gas contracts at market indexed prices representing approximately percent of its first quarter anticipated natural gas usage for its mills 
historically the company s forward purchase contracts for electricity and natural gas cover periods of twelve months or less 
the company buys forward percent of its electricity requirements for its halsey pulp mill  and at december   had purchased forward electricity through january at market indexed prices
