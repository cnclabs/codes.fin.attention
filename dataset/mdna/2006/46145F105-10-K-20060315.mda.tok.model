overall market volumes were up on nyse and were flat on nasdaq  while itg us volumes were up in  outpacing the market 
volatility picked up slightly as measured by the vix index cboe volatility index after remaining below normal levels for the last two years 
program trading as a percentage of nyse traded volume continued to rise  averaging 
this increase in program trading further intensified the competition for execution only commissions  with the remainder of order flow allocated for fundamental research commitments to full service brokers or soft dollar obligations

critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us in many instances  the application of such principles requires management to make estimates or to apply subjective principles to particular facts and circumstances 
a change in the estimates or a variance in the application  or interpretation of accounting principles generally accepted in the us could yield a materially different accounting result 
below is a summary of the company s critical accounting policies and estimates where we believe that the estimations  judgments or interpretations that we made  if different  would have yielded the most significant differences in our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  for a summary of all of our significant accounting policies  see note  summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
accounting for business combinations  goodwill and other intangibles determining the fair value of certain assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
for initial valuations  we retain valuation experts to provide us with independent fair value determinations of goodwill and other intangibles 
in addition  we perform valuations based on internally developed models 
specifically  a number of different methods are used in estimating the fair value of acquired intangibles as well as testing goodwill and other intangibles for impairment 
such methods include the income approach and the market approach 
significant estimates and assumptions applied in these approaches include  but are not limited to  projection of future cash flows  the applicable discount rate  perpetual growth rates  and adjustments made to assess the characteristics and relative performance of similar assets 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which became effective january   we discontinued the amortization of goodwill 
sfas no 
requires goodwill to be assessed no less than annually for impairment 
as of the most recent impairment test  we determined that the carrying value of goodwill for each reporting unit was not impaired 
other intangibles with definite lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives and are assessed for impairment on an annual basis or sooner when events or circumstances indicate a possible impairment pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
and sfas no 
 accounting for long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
amortization expense related to other intangibles for the years ended december    and was as follows amortization expense millions other intangibles as is the normal practice in our industry  the values we report for exchange seats  which are included within other assets in our financial statements  are valued at cost or a lesser amount if there is an other than temporary impairment in value 
the fair value of these seats was determined by referencing actual nyse seat sales occurring during our assessment of the nature and extent of impairment of the nyse seats requires considerable judgment by management with respect to evaluating external factors 
the following table indicates our sensitivity to potential future impairment charges from potential declines in the fair value of our goodwill potential future impairment in millions goodwill us operations international operations soft dollar programs we permit institutional customers to allocate a portion of their gross commissions to pay for research products and other services provided by third parties 
the amounts so allocated for those purposes are commonly referred to as soft dollar arrangements 
we are accounting for the cost of independent research and directed brokerage arrangements on an accrual basis 
commission revenue is recorded when earned on a trade date basis 
our accounting for commission revenues includes the guidance contained in emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 reporting revenues gross versus net  and accordingly  payments relating to soft dollars are netted against the commission revenues 
prepaid soft dollar research balances are included in receivables from brokers  dealers and other and accrued soft dollar research payable balances are classified as accounts payable and accrued expenses in our consolidated statements of financial condition 
we continuously monitor our customer account balances and maintain an allowance for soft dollar advances which is comprised of a general reserve based on historical collections performance plus a specific reserve for certain known customer issues 
if actual bad debts are greater than the reserves calculated based on historical trends and known customer issues  we may be required to record additional bad debt expense  which could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the periods in which such additional expense would occur 
soft dollar revenues and related prepaid and accrued soft dollar research balances for the years ended december    and were as follows millions net soft dollar commissions prepaid soft dollar research  gross allowance for prepaid soft dollar research prepaid soft dollar research  net of allowance accrued soft dollar research payable stock based compensation effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  prospectively to all awards granted  modified  or settled after january  under this method of adoption  compensation expense is recognized based on the fair value of stock options  employee stock purchase plan shares and restricted stock granted for fiscal year and future years over the related service period 
the company grants both time based and performance based equity awards 
the latter is based on a cumulative three year performance metric 
we have recorded stock based compensation expense for these awards in every year since the adoption of sfas no 
under the fair value approach  management employs considerable judgment in estimating  on the date of grant  the options expected life and expected volatility 
additionally  management estimates the number of options that are expected to vest based on the expected outcomes of the performance related conditions 
fair value securities owned  at fair value  securities sold  not yet purchased  at fair value  and investments in limited partnerships in the consolidated statements of financial condition are carried at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value  with the related unrealized gains or losses recognized in our results of operations 
the fair value of these instruments is the amount at which these instruments could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties  other than in a forced liquidation 
where available  we use the prices from independent sources such as listed market prices  or broker or dealer quotations 
for investments in illiquid and privately held securities that do not have readily determinable fair values  we use estimated fair values as determined by management 
at december   we held shares of archipelago holdings inc  acquired under an equity entitlement program  which held its initial public offering in august prior to its ipo  these shares were held at a fair value of zero as determined by management since a market price had not been observable or measurable 
although a market price was available at december   we were prohibited from selling our shares through february accordingly  following the specialized accounting practices available for broker dealers  the restriction on trading in archipelago holdings was considered in arriving at the appropriate fair value of the shares  which value was reduced from the quoted market value of million at december   to million 
all of the shares we held at december  were sold during the second half of resulting in a gain of million 
during  a technology venture capital fund in which we had invested million in ceased operations 
based upon our mark to market assessment of its portfolio  we wrote off most of this investment in  as most of its portfolio companies had ceased operations 
in and  we received distributions from the fund as part of its liquidation process which exceeded our carrying value by million and million  respectively 
income taxes sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes 
the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns 
judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
fluctuations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position or results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity our liquidity and capital resource requirements result from our working capital needs as well as our regulatory capital needs 
a substantial portion of our assets are liquid  consisting of cash and cash equivalents or assets readily convertible into cash 
we generally invest our excess cash in money market funds and other short term investments that mature within days or less 
additionally  securities owned  at fair value include mutual fund investments  common stock and warrants 
at december   cash and cash equivalents and securities owned  at fair value amounted to million and net receivables from brokers  dealers and other due within days totaled million 
in addition  we held million of total cash in restricted or segregated bank or clearing broker accounts at december  in asia  we maintain working capital facilities with a bank relating to our clearing and settlement activities 
these facilities are in the form of overdraft protection totaling approximately million and are supported by million in restricted cash deposits 
we also invest a portion of our excess cash balances in cash enhanced strategies  which we believe should generally yield higher returns without significant effect on risk 
as of december   we had investments in limited partnerships totaling million  all of which were invested in marketable securities 
operating activities cash flows provided by operating activities were million in as compared to million in the million increase was primarily attributable to increased earnings and changes in working capital 
the working capital changes include the impact of a million decrease in investments in state and municipal government securities during  which are classified on the consolidated statements of financial condition as securities owned  at fair value 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities reflects i our acquisitions of e crossnet and the of the posit joint venture that we did not already own  ii additional contingent purchase price consideration related to the acquisition of radical on march   and iii investments in premises and equipment and capitalizable software development projects  partially offset by proceeds from the sale of some of our investments in limited partnerships  the sale of state and municipal government securities  as well as archipelago holdings common stock which were classified in the consolidated statements of financial condition as securities owned  at fair value 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities reflects million in cash provided by common stock issued in connection with our employee stock purchase plan  employee stock option plan  and other equity based compensation and the related tax benefit of million 
regulatory capital under the sec s uniform net capital rule  our brokerage subsidiaries are required to maintain at all times at least the minimum level of new capital required under rule c at december   itg inc  alternet and itg execution services had net capital of million  million and million  respectively  of which million  million and million  respectively  was in excess of required net capital 
in addition  our canadian  australian  european  hong kong and japanese operations had regulatory capital in excess of the minimum requirements applicable to each business as of december  of approximately million  million  million  million and million  respectively 
loan facilities in connection with the macgregor and plexus acquisitions on january   we entered into a credit agreement with several banks the credit agreement which provided a five year term loan of million term loan to finance a portion of the purchase price 
the credit agreement also provides an available million revolving credit facility revolving loan that can be drawn upon to meet working capital needs should they arise 
as of the filing date of this annual report on form k  we have not borrowed any funds under the revolving loan 
the current borrowings under the term loan will bear interest based on the three month london interbank offered rate libor plus a margin 
our fixed charges principal repayment and interest on the term loan are projected to be approximately million for  however this estimate would be affected by changes in libor as well as our interest rate hedging activities see below 
we will also pay a commitment fee of per year on the average daily amount of the unused commitment of the revolving loan 
pursuant to the terms of the credit agreement  we will be required to maintain certain financial ratios and operating statistics  and will also be subject to certain operational limitations  including limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness  to make certain fundamental company changes such as mergers  acquisitions and dispositions of assets  to make dividends and distributions on our capital stock and to undertake certain capital expenditures 
pursuant to the credit agreement  in march we entered into interest rate swap agreements which effectively fix our interest rate on one half of the outstanding term loan principal at plus a margin for a period of three years 
the credit agreement also requires mandatory prepayments with the proceeds of certain offerings of capital stock  the incurrence of indebtedness  and sales of assets 
we may also voluntarily prepay borrowings without premium or penalty 
following potential events of default by us as specified in the credit agreement  the full amount of the borrowings may become immediately due 
for further information on the credit agreement see note  subsequent events to the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resource outlook historically  cash from operations has met all working capital and investment activity requirements  except for the macgregor and plexus acquisitions  which required external financing as described above 
we believe that our cash flow from operations  existing cash balances and the available revolving loan will be sufficient to meet our operating cash and regulatory capital needs  while also complying with the terms of the credit agreement 
off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business  we are involved in the execution of various customer securities transactions 
securities transactions are subject to the credit risk of counterparties or customer nonperformance 
in connection with the settlement of non us securities transactions  investment technology group  inc has provided third party financial institutions with guarantees in amounts up to a maximum of million 
in the event that a customer of itg s subsidiaries fails to settle a securities transaction  or if the related itg subsidiaries were unable to honor trades with a customer  investment technology group  inc would be required to perform for the amount of such securities up to the million cap 
however  transactions are collateralized by the underlying security  thereby reducing the associated risk to changes in the market value of the security through settlement date 
therefore  the settlement of these transactions is not expected to have a material effect upon our financial statements 
it is also our policy to review  as necessary  the credit worthiness of each counterparty and customer 
aggregate contractual obligations as of december   our contractual obligations and other commercial commitments amounted to million in the aggregate and consisted of the following dollars in millions payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years millions operating lease obligations minimum compensation employment agreements purchase obligations total other business combinations on september   we acquired hoenig group inc  which  through its operating affiliates  provides trade execution  independent research and other services to alternative investment funds and money managers globally 
under the terms of the transaction  hoenig group inc stockholders received approximately million  or per share  of which approximately million  or per share  were placed into an escrow account 
such escrow requirement relates to the pursuit  by the contingent payment rights committee cprc established at the time of acquisition on behalf of hoenig group inc shareholders  of certain insurance and other claims in connection with the million pre tax loss announced by hoenig group inc on may  as a result of unauthorized trading in foreign securities  by a former employee of hoenig company limited  in violation of hoenig s policies and procedures 
in december  the cprc completed its pursuit of these claims on behalf of the former hoenig shareholders and distributed million or approximately cents per share in cash to such shareholders 
we anticipate that in january  determinations will be available with respect to tax liabilities associated with the amounts recovered by the cprc 
in the event that such tax liabilities are less than the amounts remaining in the escrow  such remaining amounts will be distributed to the former hoenig group  inc shareholders 
while the amount of any such payment remains to be determined  we expect that it will not exceed per hoenig share or approximately 
in the event a second payment is made  it will represent the full and final distribution from the escrow 
on march   we acquired the remaining of radical corporation radical that we did not already own for million in cash 
the radical business augments our product offerings for the active trading community 
the total purchase price of million includes a purchase price adjustment of million  which was paid in and was based upon performance over the one year period following our february  call option exercise 
on february  we acquired morgan stanley capital international inc msci and barra inc s barra ownership interest in the posit joint venture for million plus a contingent component payable over years equal to of the revenues from the business of the posit joint venture 
as a result of the posit transaction we became the owner of all rights  title and interest  including all proprietary software of the posit joint venture 
the initial million purchase price was allocated among goodwill million  and intangible assets million consisting of the posit trade name and proprietary software 
through december   the contingent component of the purchase price approximated million  which was recorded as additional goodwill 
goodwill was assigned to the us operations and international operations segments in the amounts of million and million  respectively of which million is expected to be deductible for us tax purposes over years 
prior to the closing of the posit transaction  pursuant to license agreements with the posit joint venture  we paid quarterly royalties to the posit joint venture equal to specified percentages of the transaction fees we charge on each share crossed through posit 
through january   we incurred royalties to the posit joint venture of million  compared with royalties of million and million incurred during and  respectively 
on february   we acquired e crossnet limited e crossnet to offer professional investors in europe an integrated european equities crossing system with access to an expanded liquidity pool 
the consolidated financial statements include the results of operations of the above businesses from their respective dates of acquisition 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued a revision to sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  titled sfas no 
r  share based payment 
as a result  the fair value based method of accounting for stock based payments will be required on a modified prospective basis  meaning any previously granted but unvested awards will be recorded as an expense on a prorated basis over the remaining vesting period 
we voluntarily adopted the fair value method approach january  on a prospective basis and therefore  the impact the revised statement will have on our results of operations  financial position and cash flows will be minimal 
sfas no 
r is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  in march  the securities and exchange commission sec released sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payment sab 
sab provides the sec staff position regarding the application of sfas r 
sab contains interpretive guidance related to the interaction between sfas r and certain sec rules and regulations  as well as provides the staff s views regarding the valuation of share based payment arrangements for public companies 
sab also highlights the importance of disclosures made related to the accounting for share based payment transactions 
we are currently evaluating sab and we will be incorporating it as part of our adoption of sfas r 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections sfas  which supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting changes and sfas no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
sfas changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of changes in accounting principle 
the statement requires the retroactive application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principles  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
sfas does not change the guidance for reporting the correction of an error in previously issued financial statements or the change in an accounting estimate 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
in march  the fasb issued interpretation fin  accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations 
this clarifies the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  and provides guidance to ensure consistency in recording legal obligations associated with long lived tangible asset retirements 
we do not believe adoption of fin will have a material effect on our financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
certain factors that may affect our results of operations our results of operations may be materially affected by many factors including conditions in the us and international financial markets  general economic and political conditions  decreases in trading volumes or equity prices  competitive conditions  technological changes and events  systems infrastructure problems  legislative  legal and regulatory developments  third party credit risk and failure to provide key services  employee errors or misconduct  and intellectual property infringement

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk refers to the potential for adverse changes in the value of a company s financial instruments as a result of changes in market conditions 
we are exposed to market risk associated with changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices to the extent we own such instruments in our portfolio 
we do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions  nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
we continually evaluate our exposure to market risk and oversee the establishment of policies  procedures and controls to ensure that market risks are identified and analyzed on an ongoing basis 
we have performed sensitivity analyses on different tests of market risk as described in the following sections to estimate the impacts of a hypothetical change in market conditions on the fair value of securities owned and the us dollar value of us dollar based revenues associated with our international operations 
estimated potential losses assume the occurrence of certain adverse market conditions 
such estimates do not consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors and also do not represent management s expectations of projected losses in fair value 
we do not foresee any significant changes in the strategies used to manage interest rate risk  foreign currency risk or equity price risk in the near future 
interest rate risk our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to interest sensitive financial instruments in our investment portfolio and to interest on our term loan and revolving loan 
interest sensitive financial instruments in our investment portfolio will decline in value if interest rates increase 
our interest bearing investment portfolio primarily consists of short term  high credit quality money market funds 
the aggregate fair market value of our portfolio was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
our interest bearing investments are not insured and because of the short term high quality nature of the investments are not likely to fluctuate significantly in market value 
in connection with our acquisitions of macgregor and plexus  we borrowed million  pursuant to our credit agreement  on january  the credit agreement also provides an available million revolving loan that can be drawn upon to meet working capital needs should they arise 
as of the filing date of this annual report on form k  we have not borrowed any funds under the revolving loan 
the current borrowings under the term loan will bear interest based on the three month libor plus a margin of 
additionally  under certain circumstances specifically related to our financial ratios under the credit agreement  this margin could increase to as discussed above  our interest rate risk on debt will be affected by changes in libor and maintenance of financial ratios  as well as our interest rate hedging activities 
we are required by the terms of the credit agreement to maintain swap agreements that seek to provide that at least of the term loan will have an interest rate that is effectively fixed for at least three years 
in march  we entered into interest rate swap agreements which effectively fix our interest rate on one half of the outstanding term loan principal at plus a margin of for a period of three years 
we estimate that a hypothetical basis point increase in weighted average interest rates for would result in an approximately million increase in interest expense on the unhedged principal of the term loan 
foreign currency risk we currently operate and continue to expand globally in a variety of ways  including through our operations in canada  australia  europe  hong kong and japan  and through the development of specially tailored versions of our services 
additionally  we maintain development facilities in israel 
our investments and development activities in these countries expose us to currency exchange rate fluctuations primarily between the us dollar and the british pound sterling  euro  australian dollar  canadian dollar  hong kong dollar  japanese yen and israeli new shekel 
when the us dollar strengthens against these currencies  the us dollar value of us dollar based revenue decreases 
to the extent that our international activities recorded in local currencies increase in the future  our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates will correspondingly increase 
we have not engaged in derivative financial instruments as a means of hedging this risk 
non us dollar cash balances held overseas are generally kept at levels necessary to meet current operating and capitalization needs 
approximately and of our revenues for the years ended december  and were denominated in non us dollar currencies 
for the years ended december  and  we estimated that a hypothetical adverse change in foreign exchange rates would have resulted in a decrease in net income from our international operations of million and million  respectively 
equity price risk equity price risk results from exposure to changes in the prices of equity securities 
at times  we do hold positions overnight due to client or company errors 
equity price risk can arise from liquidating such positions 
accordingly  we maintain policies and procedures regarding the management of our errors and accommodations proprietary trading accounts 
it is our policy to attempt to trade out of all positions arising from errors and accommodations immediately while balancing our exposure to market risk 
certain positions may therefore be liquidated over a period of time in an effort to minimize market impact 
we manage equity price risk associated with open positions through the establishment and monitoring of trading policies and through controls and review procedures that ensure communication and timely resolution of trading issues 
our operations and trading departments review all open trades daily 
additionally  our clearing broker notifies us of all known trade discrepancies on the day following the trade date 
we have also established approval policies that include review by a supervisory principal of any proprietary trading activity 
our cash management strategy seeks to optimize excess liquid assets by preserving principal  maintaining liquidity to satisfy capital requirements  minimizing risk and maximizing our after tax rate of return 
our policy is to invest in high quality credit issuers  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer and invest in tax efficient strategies 
our first priority is to reduce the risk of principal loss 
we seek to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk  and re investment risk 
we attempt to mitigate default risk by investing in high quality credit securities that we believe to be low risk and by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to reductions in the credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor that we believe is adverse to our investment strategy 
for working capital purposes  we invest only in money market instruments 
cash balances that are not needed for normal operations are invested in a tax efficient manner in instruments with appropriate maturities and levels of risk to correspond to expected liquidity needs 
to the extent that we invest in marketable equity securities  we ensure portfolio liquidity by investing in marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
at december  and  our cash and cash equivalents and securities owned were approximately million and million  respectively 
our investments in limited partnership funds require approval of executive management and or the board of directors 
as of december   we had investments in limited partnerships totaling million  all of which were invested in marketable securities 
the limited partnerships employ either a hedged convertible strategy or a long short strategy to capitalize on short term price movements
