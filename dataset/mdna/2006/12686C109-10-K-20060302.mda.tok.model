cablevision systems corporation management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations summary our future performance is dependent  to a large extent  on general economic conditions including capital market characteristics  the effectiveness of direct competition  the amount of outstanding indebtedness  our ability to manage our businesses effectively  and our relative strength and leverage in the marketplace  both with suppliers and customers 
telecommunications services our telecommunications services segment derives revenues principally through monthly charges to subscribers of our video  high speed data and voice services 
these monthly charges include cable television programming  as well as  in many cases  equipment rental  pay per view and video on demand charges  high speed data and voice services 
revenue increases are derived from rate increases  increases in the number of subscribers to these services  upgrades by video customers in the level of programming package to which they subscribe  and additional services sold to our existing subscribers 
we also derive revenues from the sale of advertising time available to cable television systems 
revenues from advertising vary based upon the number and demographics of our subscribers who view the programming carried on our cable television systems 
our cable television video services  which accounted for of our consolidated revenues for the year ended december   face competition from the direct broadcast satellite business 
there are two major providers of dbs service in the united states  each with significantly higher numbers of subscribers than we have 
we compete with these dbs competitors by bundling our service offerings with products that the dbs companies cannot efficiently provide at this time  such as high speed data service and voice service carried over the cable distribution plant  as well as by providing interactive and on demand services that are currently unavailable to a dbs subscriber  such as interactive gaming and video on demand 
as discussed in greater detail below  if and when telephone companies such as verizon and at t  inc begin to provide video services on a broad scale in our service areas  they could also present a serious competitive challenge to our video services 
our high speed data services business  which accounted for of our consolidated revenues for the year ended december   faces competition from dsl providers 
these providers have become increasingly aggressive in their pricing strategies in recent years  and customers may decide that a reduced price is more important to them than the superior speed that cable modems provide 
in addition  with approximately of our basic video subscribers now subscribing to our high speed data service  opportunities to expand that base at the current pace may be limited 
the recent gains in cable modem penetration may therefore not be indicative of the results we achieve in the future 
our consumer voice offering  which accounted for approximately of our consolidated revenues for the year ended december   is competitive with incumbent offerings primarily on the basis of pricing  where unlimited united states  canada and puerto rico long distance  regional and local calling  together with certain features for which the incumbent providers charge extra  are offered at one low price 
to the extent the incumbents  who have financial resources that exceed those of the company  decide to meet our pricing and or features or reduce their pricing  future growth and success of this business may be impaired 
the regulatory framework for cable modem service and voice service is being developed and changes in how we are regulated  including increased regulation  may affect our competitive position 
the telephone companies continue constructing systems designed to provide video programming as well as voice and data services to residential customers in parts of our service area  and have announced plans for construction in additional parts 
verizon has obtained authorizations to provide video programming in several localities in new york and has begun doing so in some areas 
at t has announced its intent to provide video programming services in connecticut and is seeking an exemption from the state s cable franchise and other cable regulatory requirements 
the existence of a new  broadly deployed network with the capability of providing video  voice and data services  particularly one subject to a lesser regulatory burden  could present a significant competitive challenge to the company 
lightpath  our commercial telephone and commercial broadband business  operates in the most competitive business telecommunications market in the country and competes against the very largest telecommunications companies both incumbent local exchange companies  other competitive local exchange companies and long distance companies 
to the extent that dominant market leaders decide to reduce their prices  future success of the company may be impaired 
the trend in business communications has been shifting from a wired voice medium to a wireless  data medium 
should this trend accelerate dramatically  future growth of lightpath may be negatively impacted 
rainbow in our rainbow segment  which accounted for of our consolidated revenues for the year ended december   we earn revenues in two principal ways 
first  we receive affiliate fee payments from operators of cable television systems and direct broadcast satellite operators 
these revenues are generally on a per subscriber basis and earned under multi year affiliation agreements with those companies 
the specific affiliate fees we earn vary from operator to operator and also vary among our networks 
the second principal source of revenues in this segment is from advertising 
under our agreements with cable and satellite operators  we have the right to sell a specific amount of advertising time on our programming networks 
our advertising revenues are more variable than affiliate fees 
this is because most of our advertising is sold on a short term basis  not under long term contracts 
our advertising revenues also vary based upon the popularity of our programming as measured by rating services 
we seek to grow our revenues in the rainbow segment by increasing the number of distributors that carry our services and the number of subscribers to cable systems and satellite services that receive our programming 
we refer to this as our penetration 
amc  which is widely distributed  has less ability to increase its penetration than newer  less penetrated services 
in negotiating for increased carriage  we may be subject to requests by distributors to make upfront payments in exchange for additional subscribers or to waive or accept lower subscriber fees if certain numbers of additional subscribers are provided 
we also may help fund the distributors efforts to market our channels or we may permit distributors to offer limited promotional periods without payment of subscriber fees 
as we continue our efforts to add subscribers  our subscriber revenue may be negatively affected by subscriber acquisition fees  discounted subscriber fees and other payments  however  we believe that these transactions generate a positive return on investment over the contract period 
we seek to increase our advertising revenues through intensified marketing and by airing an increased number of minutes of national advertising but  ultimately  the level of our advertising revenues are directly related to the overall distribution  penetration of our services and the popularity including within desirable demographic groups of our services as measured by rating services 
the principal goals in this segment are to increase our affiliation fee revenues and our advertising revenues by increasing distribution and penetration of our national services 
to do this we must continue to contract for and produce high quality  attractive programming 
our greatest challenge arises from the increasing concentration of subscribers in the hands of a few cable television operators and satellite providers 
this increased concentration increases the power of those operators and providers  and could adversely affect our ability to increase the penetration of our services or even result in decreased penetration 
in addition  this concentration gives those distributors greater leverage in negotiating the pricing and other terms of affiliation agreements 
moreover  as a result of this concentration the potential impact of a loss of any one of our major affiliate relationships would be more significant 
in december  regional programming partners completed the acquisition of the interests in fox sports net bay area and fox sports net chicago that it did not already own in a transaction that was accounted for as a purchase 
as a result  as of december   we began consolidating the results of fox sports net bay area and fox sports net chicago 
the consolidation increased the revenues and expenses in our rainbow segment in  although the amount of revenues that the rainbow segment received from fox sports net chicago declined in as a result of the termination by two of its significant customers that declined to carry fox sports net chicago and to payments not being made to us due to an ongoing dispute over an existing affiliation agreement with another cable operator 
in april  the company restructured its regional programming partnership with news corporation 
as a result of the restructuring  the company now owns of madison square garden and no longer owns interests in fox sports net ohio  fox sports net florida  national sports partners or national advertising partners 
the company now also owns of fox sports net chicago as well as of fox sports net new england 
the company continues to own of fox sports net bay area 
in addition  the million promissory notes payable to news corporation and accrued interest of million on those notes incurred in connection with regional programming partners acquisition of the interests in fox sports net chicago and fox sports net bay area were contributed by news corporation to regional programming partners for no additional consideration and were cancelled without any payment being made on them 
in connection with the restructuring  the company no longer consolidates the operating results or the assets and liabilities of fox sports net ohio and fox sports net florida 
the assets and liabilities of fox sports net ohio and fox sports net florida are reflected on the company s consolidated balance sheets as of december  as assets held for sale and liabilities held for sale 
the operating results of these businesses  excluding certain allocations of general and administrative costs from the company that were not eliminated upon the sale of these businesses  have been reported in discontinued operations in the company s consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented 
beginning in the first quarter of  the voom hd networks have been included in the rainbow segment 
these channels were previously included in the rainbow dbs segment which was discontinued 
prior period segment information has been reported on a comparable basis 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements for a discussion regarding agreements entered into with echostar relating to the launch and operation of the company s voom hd networks 
madison square garden madison square garden msg  which accounted for of our consolidated revenues for the year ended december   consists of professional sports teams principally the new york knicks of the national basketball association nba and the new york rangers of the national hockey league nhl  along with the hartford wolf pack of the american hockey league and the new york liberty of the women s national basketball association  the msg networks sports programming business  and an entertainment business 
it also operates the madison square garden arena  radio city music hall  the hartford civic center and rentschler field sports and entertainment venues in connecticut  and faces competitive challenges unique to these activities 
we derive revenues in this segment primarily from the msg networks see below  the sale of tickets  including luxury box rentals  to sporting and entertainment events  from rental rights fees paid to this segment by promoters that present events at our entertainment venues and the sports teams share of league wide distributions of national television rights fees and royalties 
we also derive revenue from the sale of advertising at our venues  from food  beverage and merchandise sales at our venues and from the licensing of our trademarks 
msg networks derives its revenues from affiliate fees paid by cable television and satellite providers  sales of advertising  and from rights fees paid to this segment by broadcasters and programming services that telecast events of third party sports teams which are under contract with msg networks 
this segment s financial performance is related to the performance of all the teams presented and the attractiveness of its entertainment events 
msg s short term agreement with time warner cable  inc expired on march  and time warner cable discontinued carriage of msg network and fsn new york at such time 
on may   madison square garden and time warner cable reached a multiyear agreement on key rate and positioning terms for carriage of msg network and fsn new york and the parties subsequently entered into definitive documentation reflecting such agreement  which was retroactive to january  in  msg networks entered into a new contract with another affiliate which was also retroactive to january  the combined retroactive impact on madison square garden s revenues in for these contracts was approximately million 
our sports teams financial success is dependent on their ability to generate advertising sales  paid attendance  luxury box rentals  and food  beverage and merchandise sales 
to a large extent  the ability of the teams to build excitement among fans  and therefore produce higher revenue streams  depends on the teams winning performance  which generates regular season and playoff attendance and luxury box rentals  and which supports increases in prices charged for tickets  luxury box rentals  and advertising placement 
each team s success is dependent on its ability to acquire highly competitive personnel 
the governing bodies of the nba and the nhl have the power and authority to take certain actions that they deem to be in the best interest of their respective leagues  which may not necessarily be consistent with maximizing the professional sports teams results of operations 
effective september  the nhl commenced a lockout of the players in support of its attempt to reach a new collective bargaining agreement with the national hockey league players association nhl players association 
the parties failed to reach an agreement after several negotiating sessions and on february   the nhl announced that it had cancelled the season 
on july   the nhl and nhl players association executed a year collective bargaining agreement nhl cba ending the lockout 
the nhl players association has the right to terminate the nhl cba after years or extend it to years 
the new nhl cba includes an automatic salary reduction for existing player contracts and establishes a team salary cap for each season based on a percentage of hockey related revenues 
the team salary cap for the season is approximately million 
the new nhl cba also provides for a revenue sharing system by which the top ten teams in terms of gross preseason and regular season revenue as defined in the nhl cba  will be required to contribute to a fund which will be distributed to other teams under certain circumstances 
the company currently expects that its nhl team will be one of the top ten revenue teams in the nhl in and will be required to contribute approximately million to the revenue sharing fund 
on july   the nba and the national basketball players association entered into a new year collective bargaining agreement nba cba with the nba s option to extend it to years 
among other changes  the new nba cba changed the way luxury tax on player salaries is calculated 
under the expired nba cba  if the relationship of league wide player salaries to defined league wide basketball related income bri exceeded a specified percentage  teams whose salaries exceeded this specified percentage of bri team tax trigger were required to pay a dollar for dollar luxury tax to the extent its salaries exceeded the team tax trigger 
under the new nba cba  teams will pay a dollar for dollar luxury tax each year in which they exceed the team tax trigger  regardless of the relationship of league wide player salaries to bri 
while madison square garden did not pay a luxury tax for the season  it did pay approximately million for the season 
based on the new nba cba  madison square garden anticipates paying a luxury tax for the season the amount is currently estimated to be approximately million 
in the third quarter of  madison square garden accrued million in luxury tax for a player who had previously been waived but whose salary for the and seasons will nevertheless be subject to luxury tax under the new nba cba 
when the season began  in the fourth quarter of  madison square garden began accruing its estimated luxury tax for its other players for the season 
the success of our msg networks sports programming business is affected by our ability to secure desired programming of professional sports teams  in addition to our proprietary programming 
the continued carriage and success of the teams that are telecast by us will impact our revenues from distribution and from the rates charged for affiliation and advertising  as well as the ability to attract advertisers 
in the second quarter of  the new york mets gave notice of termination of its broadcast rights agreement with msg networks 
the termination of the rights agreement was effective after the end of the baseball season 
although the termination of the rights agreement will have a negative impact on madison square garden s revenue  we do not believe that it will have a significant impact on madison square garden s results of operations 
our entertainment business is largely dependent on the continued success of our radio city christmas spectacular and our touring christmas shows  as well as availability of  and our venues ability to attract  concerts  family shows and events 
the dependence of this segment s revenues on its sports teams and christmas shows make it seasonal with a disproportionate share of its revenues and operating income being derived in the fourth quarter of each year 
critical accounting policies in preparing its financial statements  the company is required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that it believes are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
the significant accounting policies which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following impairment of long lived and indefinite lived assets the company s long lived assets at december  include excess costs over fair value of net assets acquired goodwill of approximately billion  approximately billion of other intangible assets million of which are indefinite lived intangibles and approximately billion of property  plant and equipment 
such assets accounted for approximately of the company s consolidated total assets 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  the company is required to determine goodwill impairment using a two step process 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill that would be recognized in a business combination 
the impairment test for other indefinite lived intangible assets consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value 
if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
for other long lived assets  including intangibles that are amortized  the company evaluates assets for recoverability when there is an indicator of potential impairment 
if the undiscounted cash flows from a group of assets being evaluated is less than the carrying value of that group of assets  the fair value of the asset group is determined and the carrying value of the asset group is written down to fair value 
in assessing the recoverability of the company s goodwill and other long lived assets  the company must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge 
estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows and comparable market transactions 
these valuations are based on estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows  discount rate  determination of appropriate market comparables and the determination of whether a premium or discount should be applied to comparables 
for the telecommunications services segment  these valuations also include assumptions for average annual revenue per customer  number of homes passed  operating margin and market penetration as a percentage of homes passed  among other assumptions 
for the madison square garden and rainbow segments  these valuations also include assumptions for projected average rates per basic and viewing subscribers  number of events msg segment only  access to sports programming and film rights and the cost of such programming and film rights  amount of programming time that is advertiser supported  number of advertising spots available and the sell out rates for those spots  average fee per advertising spot  and operating margins  among other assumptions 
if these estimates or material related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record additional impairment charges related to our long lived assets 
in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations of the company s reporting units on the impairment calculation for indefinite lived intangibles  the company applied a hypothetical decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit 
this hypothetical decrease would have no impact on the impairment analysis for any of the company s reporting units 
rights to feature film inventory acquired under license agreements along with the related obligations are recorded at the contract value when a license agreement is executed or the license period has begun 
costs are amortized to technical and operating expense on the straight line basis over the respective license periods 
we periodically review the programming usefulness of our feature film inventory based on a series of factors  including ratings  type and quality of program material  standards and practices  and fitness for exhibition based on the programming of the individual programming service 
if we determine that substantially all of the films in a film license agreement have no future programming usefulness and will no longer be exploited  we would record a write off for the portion of the unamortized cost of the film license agreement that was attributed to those films 
in  the company recorded impairment losses totaling approximately million related to its decision to seek strategic alternatives for the rainbow dbs segment of its operations 
the company recorded impairment charges of million included in depreciation and amortization expense relating to long lived assets and other indefinite lived intangible assets and million included in technical and operating expenses representing the write down of certain film and programming contracts relating to its voom hd networks programming service 
in addition  the company recorded an impairment charge relating to the rainbow dbs satellite distribution business of million reflecting the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value of long lived assets and goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets and a charge of million representing the write off of equipment inventory and deposits which have been recorded in discontinued operations 
in addition to the rainbow dbs segment impairment losses  we recorded impairment losses of approximately million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively  included in technical and operating expense  representing the impairment of certain film and programming contracts and million and million in and  respectively  included in depreciation and amortization related to certain other long lived assets and intangibles primarily within our theater operations and rainbow segment 
useful lives of finite lived intangible assets the company has recognized intangible assets for affiliation relationships  affiliate agreements  advertiser relationships  season ticket holder relationships and suite holder contracts and relationships as a result of the regional programming partners restructuring transaction with news corporation in april in addition  the company has also recognized intangible assets for affiliate agreements and advertiser relationships as a result of the july repurchase of mgm s interest in each of amc  we and ifc and the repurchase of nbc s interests in rainbow media holdings in various transactions in and the company has determined that such intangible assets have finite lives and has estimated those lives to be to years for affiliate agreements  years for affiliation relationships  to years for advertiser relationships  to years for season ticket holder relationships and to years for suite holder contracts and relationships 
at december   the carrying values  net of accumulated amortization  were million for affiliate agreements and affiliation relationships  million for broadcast rights and other agreements  million for advertiser relationships  million for season ticket holder relationships  million for suite holder contracts and relationships and million for other intangibles 
the amount we originally allocated in purchase accounting to the affiliate agreements and affiliation relationships finite lived intangibles in our consolidated financial statements is the estimated aggregate fair value of those affiliate agreements  affiliation relationships and the related customer relationships 
the useful lives for the affiliate agreements were determined based upon an analysis of the weighted average lives of existing agreements the company had in place with its major customers at the time that purchase accounting was applied  plus an estimate for renewals of such agreements 
the company has been successful in renewing its affiliate agreements and maintaining customer relationships in the past and believes it will be able to renew its major affiliate agreements and maintain those customer relationships in the future 
however  it is possible that the company will not successfully renew such agreements as they expire or that if it does  the net revenue earned may not equal or exceed the net revenue currently being earned  which could have a significant adverse impact on our business 
in light of these facts and circumstances  the company has determined that an estimated useful life of to years for affiliate agreements and years for affiliation relationships is appropriate depending on the nature of the underlying intangible asset 
there have been periods when an existing affiliate agreement has expired and the parties have not finalized negotiations of either a renewal of that agreement or a new agreement for certain periods of time 
in substantially all these instances  the affiliates continued to carry and pay for the service under oral or written interim agreements until execution of definitive replacement agreements or renewal 
in one case during  there was a day period in which an affiliate was restricted from carrying certain of the company s sports and entertainment networks because the parties had not reached agreement on contract renewal terms 
we reached a short term agreement with the affiliate at the end of the day period and that affiliate continuously carried the networks pursuant to successive subsequent short term agreements through march  however  we were unable to reach an agreement with this affiliate at expiration on march   and this affiliate discontinued carriage of certain of the company s sports networks 
on may   we reached a multi year agreement on key rate and positioning terms for carriage of these sports networks and the parties subsequently entered into definitive documentation reflecting such agreement 
see impairment of long lived and indefinite lived assets above 
if an affiliate were to cease carrying the service on an other than temporary basis  the company would record an impairment charge for the then remaining carrying value of that affiliate agreement 
if the company were to renew an affiliate agreement at rates that produced materially less net revenue compared to the net revenue produced under the previous agreement  the company would evaluate the impact on its cash flows and  if necessary  would further evaluate such indication of potential impairment by following the policy described above under impairment of long lived and indefinite lived assets for the asset group containing that intangible 
the company also would evaluate whether the remaining useful life of the affiliate agreement remained appropriate 
based on december  carrying values  if the estimated life of all affiliate agreements and affiliation relationships were shortened by  the effect on amortization in the year ending december  would be to increase our annual amortization expense by approximately million 
valuation of deferred tax assets deferred tax assets have resulted primarily from the company s future deductible temporary differences and net operating loss carry forwards 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the company s ability to realize its deferred tax assets depends upon the generation of sufficient future taxable income to allow for the utilization of its net operating loss carry forwards and deductible temporary differences and tax planning strategies 
if such estimates and related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record additional valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
management evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets and the need for additional valuation allowances quarterly 
at this time  based on current facts and circumstances  management believes that it is more likely than not that the company will realize benefit for its gross deferred tax assets  except those deferred tax assets against which a valuation allowance has been recorded 
in  and  the company recorded increases in the valuation allowance of million  million and million  respectively  relating to certain state net operating loss carry forwards 
during  certain state net operating loss carry forwards expired prior to utilization 
the deferred tax asset corresponding to the expired net operating loss carry forwards had been fully offset by a valuation allowance 
the deferred tax asset and valuation allowance were both reduced by million 
plant and equipment costs incurred in the construction of the company s cable television system  including line extensions to  and rebuild of  the company s hybrid fiber coaxial infrastructure and costs incurred in the construction of the company s headend facilities are capitalized 
these costs consist of materials  subcontractor labor  direct consulting fees  and internal labor and related costs associated with the construction activities 
the internal costs that are capitalized consist of salaries and benefits of company employees and the portion of facility costs  including rent  taxes  insurance and utilities  that supports the construction activities 
these costs are depreciated over years based on the estimated life of the plant  and headend facilities are depreciated over the estimated life of the specific component  ranging from years for certain electronics to years for tower sites 
costs of operating the plant and the technical facilities  including repairs and maintenance and call completion fees  are expensed as incurred 
costs incurred to connect businesses or residences that have not been previously connected to the infrastructure or digital platform are also capitalized 
these costs include materials  subcontractor labor  internal labor to connect  provision and provide on site and remote technical assistance and other related costs associated with the connection activities 
in addition  on site and remote technical assistance during the provisioning process for new digital product offerings are capitalized 
the departmental activities supporting the connection process are tracked through specific metrics  and the portion of departmental costs that is capitalized is determined through a time weighted activity allocation of costs incurred based on time studies used to estimate the average time spent on each activity 
new connections are amortized over years or years for residence wiring and feeder cable to the home  respectively 
the portion of departmental costs related to reconnection  programming service up and down grade  repair and maintenance  and disconnection activities are expensed as incurred 
certain of these capitalized costs are based on estimates of activity levels and other historical statistics 
these estimates are evaluated at least semi annually  and any changes that result  which may be significant  are reflected in the results of operations in the period in which the evaluations are performed 
benefit plans the company utilizes actuarial methods required by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for pensions  to account for the company s choice cash balance retirement plan the csc plan and the madison square garden retirement plan the msg plan collectively  the plans 
the actuarial methods for the plans require numerous assumptions to calculate the net periodic pension benefit expense and the related pension benefit obligation for the plans 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions  including the discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
material changes in the pension costs of the plans may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions  changes in the number of the csc plan participants the msg plan is frozen and no longer admits new participants  changes in the level of benefits provided  changes in asset levels and changes in legislation 
our assumptions reflect our historical experience and management s best judgment regarding future expectations 
since pension liabilities are measured on a discounted basis  the discount rate is a significant assumption 
the discount rate is subject to change each year  consistent with changes in applicable high quality  long term corporate bond indices 
based on the expected duration of the benefit payments for the plans  we refer to applicable bond yields such as moody s aaa baa corporate bonds and the buck consultants discount rate model which is developed by examining the yields on selected highly rated corporate bonds  to select a rate at which we believe the plans benefits could be effectively settled 
based on the published rates and the results from the buck consultants discount rate model as of december   we used a discount rate of  a decline of basis points from the rate used as of december  for the plans 
for the year ended december   this had the effect of increasing the csc plan s projected pension benefit obligation by approximately million and for  this has the effect of increasing pension service cost for the csc plan by approximately million 
for the year ended december   this had the effect of increasing our projected pension benefit obligation by approximately million for the msg plan and for  this has the effect of increasing pension service cost for the msg plan by approximately million 
the expected long term rate of return on the plans assets should  over time  approximate the actual long term returns on plan assets 
the expected long term rate of return on the plans assets is selected by taking into account the targeted asset mix of the plans  and whether the plans assets are actively managed 
the forward looking assumptions underlying our expected long term rate of return are developed by our actuary and reviewed by us for reasonableness 
the return and risk assumptions consider such factors as historical and anticipated long term performance of individual asset classes  risk premium for active management based on qualitative and quantitative analysis and correlations of the asset classes that comprise the asset portfolio 
the expected rate of return on the plans assets will remain unchanged at for a basis point change in the expected long term rate of return would result in approximately a million and million change in the csc plan s and msg plan s expense  respectively 
generally accepted accounting principles include mechanisms that serve to limit the volatility in our earnings which otherwise would result from recording changes in the value of plan assets and benefit obligations in our consolidated financial statements in the periods in which those changes occur 
for example  while the expected long term rate of return on the plans assets should  over time  approximate the actual long term returns  differences between the expected and actual returns could occur in any given year 
these differences contribute to the deferred actuarial gains or losses  which are then amortized over time 
during years and for the csc plan and in for the msg plan  the plans did not achieve their expected rate of return on assets  causing expected returns to exceed actual returns 
declining discount rates  and these lower than anticipated asset returns resulted in a lower than expected funded position for the plans 
at december   the csc plan had a projected benefit obligation of million and assets of million  after taking into account million in contributions made in contributions of million will be required for the csc plan in the company currently expects to contribute the minimum required contribution in pension expense was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively for the csc plan 
pension expense for the csc plan for is estimated to be approximately million 
the pension expense estimate incorporates the assumptions described above  as well as the impact of increased csc plan assets resulting from our anticipated contributions of million to be made in at december   the msg plan had a projected benefit obligation of million and assets of million  after taking into account million in contributions made in fiscal the company is currently not required to make a minimum contribution to the msg plan in  however we expect to make a discretionary contribution of million to reduce future contribution requirements 
pension expense was million and million for years and  respectively for the msg plan 
pension expense for is estimated to be approximately million 
the pension expense estimate incorporates the assumptions described above  as well as the impact of increased msg plan assets resulting from our anticipated contributions of million to be made in certain transactions the following transactions occurred during the periods covered by this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
transactions 
in april  the company and news corporation restructured the regional programming partnership 
as a result  the company now owns of madison square garden and no longer owns interests in fox sports net ohio  fox sports net florida  national sports partners or national advertising partners 
the company also owns of fox sports net chicago as well as of fox sports net new england and continues to own of fox sports net bay area

this decrease was primarily due to a reduction in costs attributable to the cancellation of the nhl season 
other factors contributing to this decrease were lower costs associated with events held outside the company s venues  the absence of the costs for a christmas carol due to the discontinuation of this show  as well as lower operating costs at msg networks 
the impact of these favorable results  aggregating million  was substantially offset by a net increase of million 
the main drivers of this net increase were higher provisions for knicks active roster luxury tax and for certain team transactions  higher team compensation  a credit recorded in the first quarter of reflecting the reversal of a luxury tax provision attributable to a certain player who was previously waived due to a career ending injury  as well as increased costs associated with favorable revenue items discussed above

liquidity and capital resources overview cablevision has no operations independent of its subsidiaries 
cablevision s outstanding securities consist of cablevision ny group class a and cablevision ny group class b common stock and billion of debt securities 
funding for the debt service requirements of our debt securities is provided by our subsidiary operations  principally csc holdings  as permitted by the covenants governing subsidiary credit agreements and public debt securities 
funding for our subsidiaries is generally provided by cash flow from operations  cash on hand  and borrowings under bank credit facilities made available to the restricted group as later defined and to rainbow national services and the proceeds from the issuance of notes and debentures in the capital markets 
the company has also accessed the debt markets for significant amounts of capital over the last several years and may do so from time to time 
csc holdings and those of its subsidiaries which conduct our video  high speed data service operations as well as our commercial telephone and high speed data service throughout the new york metropolitan area and  effective as of december   our residential voice services operations comprise the restricted group since they are subject to the covenants and restrictions of the restricted group s credit facility and the indenture governing the notes and debentures issued by csc holdings and cablevision 
the restricted group funded in and i requirements of the telecommunications services segment  ii requirements of certain rainbow media holdings programming businesses primarily our fuse subsidiary and our regional news operations  and iii certain other general corporate requirements 
in addition  in  the restricted group also funded certain rainbow dbs expenditures planned for  but not funded  during in  the restricted group funded the shutdown costs of the rainbow dbs satellite distribution business and received the net proceeds related to the sale of the satellite to echostar as a distribution from rainbow media enterprises a wholly owned subsidiary of rainbow media holdings which received such proceeds through a loan from rainbow dbs 
in august  rns  our wholly owned subsidiary which owns the common equity interests in the company s amc  we women s entertainment and ifc programming operations issued million of senior and senior subordinated notes and entered into a million senior secured credit facility million of which is a revolving credit facility and million of which is a term loan facility 
rns cash from operations and proceeds from borrowings available to it provided funding for the rainbow dbs satellite distribution business which was shut down in and the voom hd networks programming business 
madison square garden s funding requirements had traditionally been primarily provided through cash from operations and previous borrowings under a million credit facility 
in march  borrowings under the madison square garden credit facility were repaid in full with proceeds from a million equity contribution from regional programming partners and the credit facility was terminated 
the following table summarizes our outstanding debt and present value of capital leases as well as interest expense and capital expenditures as of and for the year ended december  cablevision restricted group rainbow national services other entities total dollars in thousands bank debt capital leases notes payable senior notes and debentures senior subordinated debentures collateralized indebtedness relating to stock monetizations total debt interest expense capital expenditures total amounts payable by the company and its subsidiaries in connection with its outstanding obligations during the five years subsequent to december  and thereafter  including capital leases  the value deliverable at maturity under monetization contracts and the  of outstanding bank debt as of december  reflected on a pro forma basis in the table below under the payment requirements of the new credit facility entered into on february   are as follows cablevision restricted group rainbow national services other entities total dollars in thousands thereafter total cablevision has the option  at maturity  to deliver the shares of common stock underlying the monetization contracts along with proceeds from the related derivative contracts in full satisfaction of the maturing collateralized indebtedness or obtain the required cash equivalent of the common stock through new monetization and derivative contracts 
the amounts included in the table are  in   in and  in restricted group as of december   csc holdings and those of its subsidiaries which conduct our cable television video operations including approximately million digital video subscribers and high speed data service which encompassed approximately million subscribers and our residential voice services operations which encompasses approximately  subscribers as well as our commercial telephone and high speed data service throughout the new york metropolitan area comprise the restricted group since they are subject to the covenants and restrictions of the credit facility and the indentures governing the notes and debentures securities issued by csc holdings 
in addition  the restricted group is also subject to the covenants of the debt issued by cablevision 
sources of cash for the restricted group include primarily cash flow from the operations of the businesses in the restricted group  borrowings under its bank credit agreement and issuance of notes and debentures in the capital markets 
in addition  during the second quarter of  excess cash balances totaling approximately million held by rainbow media enterprises and various other entities were distributed to csc holdings and used to repay outstanding borrowings under the restricted group revolver 
the restricted group s principal uses of cash include capital spending  in particular the capital requirements associated with the growth of its services such as digital video  high speed data and voice  debt service  including distributions made to cablevision to service interest expense on its debt securities  other corporate expenses and changes in working capital  as well as investments that it funds from time to time  including investments to fund certain rainbow programming operations 
on february   the restricted group entered into a new billion credit facility with a group of banks which facility consists of a billion revolver that is undrawn  a billion term a facility and a million term a facility 
approximately billion of the billion received from the term loans under the new credit facility was used to repay the outstanding borrowings and accrued interest under the prior restricted group credit facility that was scheduled to mature in june  and fees and expenses 
we currently expect that the net funding and investment requirements of the restricted group will be met with cash generated by operating activities and borrowings under the restricted group s new bank credit facility and that the restricted group s available borrowing capacity under that facility will be sufficient to meet these requirements for the next months 
the company announced on january  that it expects its board of directors to begin reconsideration of a special dividend at its regularly scheduled meeting in march there can be no assurance that the board will decide to move forward with a special dividend 
if the board of directors of cablevision declares a special dividend  all of the funds to pay that dividend will have to be raised from the incurrence of additional debt 
the new credit facilities at csc holdings permit the incurrence of an additional billion of senior secured debt with the first million being used to repay the new term a loan 
aside from the billion revolver  there are no commitments from the lenders to fund any additional borrowings 
we are already highly leveraged 
the incremental borrowings would increase our leverage substantially and reduce our borrowing capacity and financial flexibility 
in addition  these additional borrowings would increase our interest expense and our other debt service requirements  which are already substantial 
the three components of the new restricted group credit facility are direct obligations of csc holdings  which are guaranteed by most restricted group subsidiaries and secured by the pledge of the stock of most restricted group subsidiaries 
each of the revolving credit facility and the two term loans have a six year maturity 
the revolver has no interim amortization while the billion term a loan has amortization payments of in year one  in each of years two and three  in each of years four and five  and in the final year 
the million term a loan is subject to quarterly amortization payments totaling each year 
principal financial covenants include i maximum total leverage of times cash flow through september  stepping down on october  to times in the event that csc holdings pays a dividend to cablevision funded in whole or in part by at least billion of additional debt special dividend or times in the event no special dividend is made with  in either case  subsequent stepdowns over the life of the facility  ii maximum senior secured leverage of times cash flow through december  with annual stepdowns thereafter the maximum ratio in effect is further reduced by 
times after september  if a special dividend is not paid  and iii minimum ratios for cash flow to interest expense of initially  increasing to if the special dividend is not paid on and after july   iv a minimum ratio of cash flow less cash taxes to total debt expense defined to include interest expense  certain payments of principal and dividends paid by csc holdings to cablevision to permit cablevision to pay interest and certain principal payments on its debt of these covenants and restrictions on the permitted use of borrowed funds may limit our ability to utilize all of the undrawn revolver funds 
additional covenants include limitations on liens and the issuance of additional debt 
there are generally no restrictions on investments that the restricted group may make  provided it is not in default 
the restricted group can make distributions or other restricted payments so long as csc holdings is not in default but there is a limitation initially million on restricted payments during any period when the cash flow leverage ratio is greater than times times after september  
the limitation does not apply to restricted payments used by cablevision to make scheduled payments of principal or interest on its indebtedness 
our ability to make restricted payments is also limited by provisions in the indentures covering our notes and debentures 
csc holdings  a member of the restricted group  has also issued senior and senior subordinated notes and debentures  which also contain financial and other covenants  though they are generally less restrictive than the covenants contained in the restricted group s bank credit facility 
principal covenants include a limitation on the incurrence of additional indebtedness based upon a maximum ratio of total indebtedness to cash flow as defined in the indentures of and limitations on dividends and distributions 
the indentures governing the cablevision note and debenture issuances contain similar covenants and restrictions  including a limitation on additional debt incurrence based on a debt to cash flow ratio 
there are no covenants  events of default  borrowing conditions or other terms in the restricted group s credit facility or in any of csc holdings or cablevision s other debt securities that are based on changes in the credit ratings assigned by any rating agency  other than an increase in the interest rate of up to 
for the term a facility if it has not been refinanced or repaid and the ratings are one notch lower than the current rating by june  cablevision s and csc holdings future access to the debt markets and the cost of any future debt issuances are also influenced by their credit ratings  which are provided by moody s investors service and standard poor s 
in february  standard and poor s and moody s investors service announced the ratings on the new billion credit facility 
standard poors rated the new credit facilities at bb  upgraded the company s corporate credit rating to bb from bb and upgraded all ratings for cablevision one notch except the unsecured debt at csc holdings 
moody s rates the new credit facilities at ba and left the company s other ratings unchanged 
both agencies changed the ratings outlook to stable 
if the million term a facility is not refinanced by june  and the ratings on this debt were to drop below the current ratings discussed above  the spread of libor on this facility would increase by basis points 
any future downgrade to the cablevision and or csc holdings credit ratings by either rating agency could increase the interest rate on future debt issuances and could adversely impact their ability to raise additional funds 
rainbow media holdings on august   rainbow media holdings then existing million credit facility was repaid and terminated with a distribution from the proceeds of the rns financing described below 
on the same date  the commitment from a bank to provide up to million of senior subordinated funding to rainbow media holdings which was to be guaranteed by amc  we women s entertainment and ifc was also terminated 
rainbow national services rns  our wholly owned subsidiary which owns the common equity interests in the company s amc  we women s entertainment and ifc programming operations  generated positive cash from operations in and its cash  plus proceeds from borrowings available to it  may provide funding to other rainbow developing programming services  including the voom hd networks  subject to the applicable covenants and limitations contained in rns financing agreements 
we currently expect that the net funding and investment requirements of these other rainbow programming entities will be funded by distributions from rns 
the rns credit facility is a million senior secured credit facility  comprised of a million term loan and a million revolving credit facility secured by the assets and common equity interests of amc  we women s entertainment and ifc  guaranteed by rainbow programming holdings  rns s direct parent and all of the other direct and indirect subsidiaries of rns 
the term loan requires quarterly amortization payments of of the original outstanding balance million beginning june  through march  and of the original outstanding balance million for each quarter thereafter through maturity on march  the revolving credit facility will be reduced quarterly commencing december  and through september   by million  and for each quarter ending december  through september  by million 
outstanding borrowings under the term loan were million as of february   with million in undrawn revolver commitments 
financial covenants include i a maximum total leverage ratio of total debt to annualized cash flow as defined based on the cash flows of amc  we and ifc on a consolidated basis of times  through december  with periodic reductions thereafter to times as of january   ii a maximum senior debt leverage ratio as defined to annualized cash flow of times through march  decreasing to times through december   with periodic reductions thereafter to times as of january   and iii minimum ratios for cash flow to interest expense of times during the term of the agreement and cash flow to debt service of times through december  increasing to times for the remainder of the agreement 
these covenants and restrictions on the permitted use of borrowed funds may limit our ability to utilize all of the undrawn funds available 
additional covenants include limitations on liens  the issuance of additional indebtedness and distributions and investments 
rns is permitted to make investments and distributions up to million annually with a cumulative limit of million for general discretionary purposes and  subject to having a maximum ratio of total debt to annualized cash flow of times  distributions and investments of up to million from the proceeds of permitted future debt offerings 
rns s notes outstanding consist of million face amount of senior notes due september   and million face amount of senior subordinated notes due september  these issuances are guaranteed by substantially all of rns s subsidiaries 
principal covenants include a limitation on the incurrence of additional indebtedness based upon a maximum ratio of total indebtedness to cash flow as defined in the indentures of  reducing to after january   limitations on dividends and distributions  investments and liens 
rns s future access to the debt markets and the cost of any future debt issuances are also influenced by its credit ratings  which are provided by moody s investors service and standard and poor s 
on february   standard and poor s announced that rns s corporate credit rating was changed to bb from bb  the senior secured bank loan rating to bb from bb and the senior and senior subordinated unsecured debt to b from b 
the ratings outlook was changed to stable from developing 
moody s ratings are b for the corporate family rating  ba for the senior secured bank loan  b for the senior unsecured debt and b for the senior subordinated debt and the ratings outlook is stable 
any future downgrade to rns s credit ratings by either rating agency could increase the interest rate on future debt issuances and could adversely impact rns s ability to raise additional funds 
madison square garden traditionally  madison square garden s primary source of liquidity had been its cash flow from operations and a previous million revolving credit facility

the company received waivers from the lenders under these agreements and certain technical and clarifying amendments have been made to the rns credit facility agreement

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risks from changes in certain equity security prices and interest rates 
our exposure to changes in equity security prices stems primarily from the comcast  at t  charter communications  general electric  leapfrog enterprises and adelphia communications common stock held by us 
we have entered into prepaid forward contracts consisting of a collateralized loan and an equity collar to hedge our equity price risk and to monetize the value of these securities other than million shares of adelphia communications common stock 
these contracts  at maturity  are expected to offset declines in the fair value of these securities below the hedge price per share  while allowing us to retain upside appreciation from the hedge price per share to the relevant cap price 
the contracts actual hedge prices per share vary depending on average stock prices in effect at the time the contracts were executed 
the contracts actual cap prices vary depending on the maturity and terms of each contract  among other factors 
in the event of an early termination of any of these contracts  we would be obligated to repay the collateralized indebtedness less the sum of the fair value of the underlying stock and the fair value of the equity collar  calculated at the termination date 
the underlying stock and equity collars are carried at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet and the collateralized indebtedness is carried at its accreted value 
as of december   the fair value and the carrying value of our holdings of comcast  at t  charter communications  general electric  leapfrog and adelphia communications common stock aggregated million 
assuming a change in price  the potential change in the fair value of these investments would be approximately million 
as of december   the net fair value and the carrying value of the equity collar component of the prepaid forward contracts entered into to hedge the equity price risk of these securities aggregated million  a net receivable position 
the maturity  number of shares deliverable at the relevant maturity  hedge price per share  and the lowest and highest cap prices received for each security monetized via a prepaid forward contract are summarized in the following table cap price security of shares deliverable maturity hedge price per share low high comcast at t charter communications general electric leapfrog represents the price below which we are provided with downside protection and above which we retain upside appreciation 
also represents the price used in determining the cash proceeds payable to us at inception of the contracts 
represents the price up to which we receive the benefit of stock price appreciation 
in november  sbc communications corp 
merged with at t corp 
as a result of this merger  at t shares were exchanged with shares of the newly merged company at t inc at an exchange rate of 
the impact of this merger changed the number of at t inc shares issued to the company  as well as adjusted the hedge price and cap price per share the company monetizes 
in october  the company received million in cash in exchange for all million shares it owned of at t wireless common stock  representing the share price paid in consideration of the merger between at t wireless and cingular wireless llc 
the shares and resultant cash exchanged for such shares had previously been pledged in support of the repayment of the collateralized debt 
as a result of that exchange  the company s prepaid forward contracts relating to its shares of at t wireless were terminated 
the termination provisions under the prepaid forward contracts required the company to repay the fair value of the collateralized indebtedness less the sum of the fair value of the underlying stock and equity collars 
the company recognized a loss on the extinguishment of debt of approximately million representing the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the collateralized indebtedness 
at december   the company had settled certain collateralized indebtedness with a fair value of million by releasing to the counterparty cash proceeds from the related prepaid forward contract totaling million and the cash from the merger transaction of million both of which had been pledged in settlement of the debt 
the company received the net difference of million in cash 
the remaining collateralized indebtedness related to the at t wireless shares was settled in february and accordingly  the balance sheet at december  reflects the redemption value of the collateralized indebtedness of million  the fair value of the prepaid forward contracts of million and restricted cash of million 
the company received net cash proceeds of million in february upon settlement of this obligation 
our exposure to interest rate movements results from our use of floating and fixed rate debt to fund our working capital  capital expenditures  and other operational and investment requirements 
to manage interest rate risk  from time to time we have entered into interest rate swap contracts to adjust the proportion of total debt that is subject to variable and fixed interest rates 
such contracts fix the borrowing rates on floating rate debt to provide an economic hedge against the risk of rising rates and or convert fixed rate borrowings to variable rates to provide an economic hedge against the risk of higher borrowing costs in a declining interest rate environment 
in addition  from time to time we may utilize short term interest rate lock agreements to hedge the risk that the cost of a future issuance of fixed rate debt may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates 
we do not enter into interest rate swap contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
in addition  at december   the company had other investment securities with a carrying value of million 
assuming a change in the price of the securities  the potential change in the fair value of these investments would be approximately million 
fair value of debt based on the level of interest rates prevailing at december   the fair value of our fixed rate debt of  million was less than the carrying value of  million by approximately million 
the fair value of these financial instruments is estimated based on reference to quoted market prices for these or comparable securities 
our floating rate borrowings bear interest in reference to current libor based market rates and thus approximate fair value 
the effect of a hypothetical basis point decrease in interest rates prevailing at december  would increase the estimated fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately million to  million 
this estimate is based on the assumption of an immediate and parallel shift in interest rates across all maturities 
interest rate derivative contracts as of december   we had outstanding interest rate swap contracts to convert fixed rate debt to floating rate debt covering a total notional principal amount of million 
as of december   the fair market value and carrying value of these interest rate swap contracts was approximately million  a net liability position  as reflected under derivative contracts in our consolidated balance sheet 
assuming an immediate and parallel shift in interest rates across the yield curve  a basis point increase in interest rates from december  prevailing levels would increase our liability under these contracts to million 
in addition  we had outstanding prepaid interest rate swap contracts with a notional value of million entered into in connection with our monetization transactions 
as of december   such contracts had a fair market value and carrying value of million  a net liability position  reflected as liabilities under derivative contracts in our consolidated balance sheet 
assuming an immediate and parallel shift in interest rates across the yield curve  a basis point increase in interest rates from december  prevailing levels would increase our liability under these derivative contracts by approximately million to a liability of million
