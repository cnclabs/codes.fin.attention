 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations fin 
fin clarifies that a company is required to recognize a liability for a conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred if the fair value of the obligation can be reasonably estimated 
this interpretation further clarified conditional asset retirement obligations  as used in sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  as a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
fin is effective for companies no later than the end of their first fiscal year ending after december  the adoption of fin did not have any significant impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  net sales and expenses 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and materially impact the carrying value of the assets and liabilities 
the company believes the following accounting policies are critical to the company s business operations and the understanding of the company s results of operations and financial condition 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company s accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may be uncollectible in the future 
in circumstances where the company is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  a specific reserve for bad debts is recorded against the accounts receivable balance to reduce the amount due to the net amount reasonably expected to be collected 
additionally  a general percentage of past due receivables is reserved  based on the company s past experience of collectibility 
if circumstances change ie  higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligations  estimates of the recoverability of amounts due could be reduced by a material amount 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market value 
cost is determined using the last in  first out lifo method for the majority of the company s inventories 
in valuing inventory  management is required to make assumptions regarding the level of reserves required to value potentially obsolete or slow moving items to the lower of cost or market value 
inventory reserves are established taking into account inventory age and frequency of use or sale 
while calculations are made involving these factors  significant management judgment regarding expectations for future events is involved 
future events that could significantly influence management s judgment and related estimates include general economic conditions in markets where the company s products are sold  as well as new products and design changes introduced by the company 
accrued warranty the company establishes reserves related to the warranties provided on its products 
specific reserves are maintained for programs related to known machine safety and reliability issues 
when establishing specific reserves  estimates are made regarding the size of the population  the type of program  costs to be incurred and estimated participation 
additionally  general reserves are maintained based on the historical percentage relationships of warranty costs to machine sales and applied to current equipment sales 
if these estimates and related assumptions change  reserve levels may require adjustment 
accrued product liability the company records a general reserve for potential product liability claims based on the company s prior claim experience and specific reserves for known product liability claims 
specific reserves for known claims are valued based upon the company s prior claims experience  including consideration of the jurisdiction  circumstances of the accident  type of loss or injury  identity of plaintiff  other potential responsible parties  analysis of outside counsel  and analysis of internal product liability counsel 
actual product liability costs could be different due to a number of variables  including decisions of juries or judges 
goodwill impairment in connection with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  the company is required to perform goodwill impairment reviews  at least annually  using a fair value based approach 
the company performs its annual impairment review as of december as part of the annual impairment review  an estimate of the fair value of the company s construction equipment segment the entire carrying amount of goodwill is allocated to the construction segment  primarily by using a discounted cash flow analysis  is performed 
significant assumptions used in this analysis include expected future revenue growth rates  operating profit margins  working capital levels and a weighted average cost of capital 
changes in assumptions could significantly impact the estimate of the fair value of the construction equipment segment  which could result in a goodwill impairment charge and could have a significant impact on the results of the construction equipment segment and the consolidated financial statements 
pension and postretirement benefits pension and postretirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent on assumptions used in calculation of these amounts 
these assumptions  used by actuaries  include discount rates  expected return on plan assets for funded plans  rate of salary increases  health care cost trend rates  mortality rates and other factors 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are accumulated and amortized to future periods and therefore affect recognized expense and recorded obligations in future periods 
while the company believes that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may materially effect its financial position or results of operations 
outlook the company s markets for compact equipment continued to show strong demand throughout the fourth quarter of orders in the fourth quarter increased over compared to the prior year  driven largely by the company s introduction of its new e series skid loader line and the continuing strength of rental industry demand for telescopic handlers 
backlog at december   of million  increased over from year end based on forecasted market growth for compact equipment in north america  as well as the company s recent order rate  backlog position and production capacity  the company expects net sales to be in the range of million to million  an increase of between and over levels 
operating margins are expected to continue to improve as the result of initiatives to tightly manage costs and improve efficiencies throughout the organization 
provided general economic conditions continue to be favorable  input prices remain stable  and the availability of product from the company s suppliers is sufficient to meet demand  the company expects to earn in the range of to per share in expected earnings per share include an estimated 
per share of compensation expense related to the company s adoption  in the first quarter of  of sfas r  which requires companies to recognize compensation expense for all stock based awards

the reference day libor rate was at december  the variable to fixed interest rate swap is an effective cash flow hedge 
the fair value of the swaps will be recorded on the balance sheet  with changes in fair value included in other comprehensive income loss 
swap gains or losses included in other comprehensive income loss are reclassified into earnings at the time the related interest expense is recognized or settlement of the obligation occurs 
a increase or decrease in the average cost of the company s variable rate debt would result in a change in pre tax interest expense of approximately  based on borrowings outstanding at december  commodity risk the company is exposed to fluctuations in market prices for commodities  especially steel 
the company has established arrangements to manage the negotiations of commodity prices and  where possible  to limit near term exposure to fluctuations in certain raw material prices

from time to time the company has entered into contracts to hedge a portion of its currency risk associated with supply agreements which do not contain currency risk sharing mechanisms 
the company was not a party to any currency hedging contracts at december
