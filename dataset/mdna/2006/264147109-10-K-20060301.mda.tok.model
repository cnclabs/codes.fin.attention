critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that can have a significant impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations  and that require the use of subjective estimates based upon past experience and management s judgment 
because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates  actual results may differ from these estimates 
below are those policies applied in preparing our financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions 
for additional accounting policies  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  collection is reasonably assured and delivery of products has occurred or services have been rendered 
revenue is recognized under long term contracts on the same basis as other sale transactions 
provision for estimated losses on contracts the company records provisions for estimated losses on contracts in the period in which such losses are identified 
the provisions for estimated losses on contracts require management to make certain estimates and assumptions  including with respect to the future revenue under a contract and the future cost to complete the contract 
management s estimate of the future cost to complete a contract may include assumptions as to improvements in manufacturing efficiency and reductions in operating and material costs 
if any of these or other assumptions and estimates are not recognized in the future  the company may be required to record additional provisions for estimated losses on contracts 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses from the inability of customers to make required payments 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is evaluated periodically based on the aging of accounts receivable  the financial condition of customers and their payment history  historical write off experience and other assumptions 
the determination of the allowance for doubtful accounts requires management to make estimates as to these and other factors on the ultimate realization of accounts receivable 
these estimates historically have not resulted in material adjustments in subsequent periods when the estimates were adjusted to actual amounts 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined on a first in  first out basis 
inventoried costs include raw materials  outside processing  direct labor and allocated overhead  but do not include any selling  general and administrative expense 
costs 
table of contents under long term contracts are accumulated into  and removed from  inventory on the same basis as other contracts 
the company assesses the inventory carrying value and reduces it if necessary to its net realizable value based on customer orders on hand  and internal demand forecasts using management s best estimates given information currently available 
the company s customer demand is highly unpredictable  and can fluctuate significantly caused by factors beyond the control of the company 
the company maintains an allowance for inventories for potentially excess and obsolete inventories and inventories that are carried at costs that are higher than their estimated net realizable values 
if market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  such as an unanticipated decline in demand not meeting expectations  inventory write downs may be required 
goodwill the company s business acquisitions have typically resulted in goodwill  which affects the amount of possible impairment expense that the company may incur 
the determination of the value of goodwill requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company performs goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis in the fourth quarter and between annual tests  in certain circumstances  whenever events may indicate an impairment may have occurred 
goodwill is tested for impairment utilizing a two step method 
in the first step  the company determines the fair value of the reporting unit using expected future discounted cash flows and other market valuation approaches 
if the net book value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value  the company would then perform the second step of the impairment test which requires allocation of the reporting unit s fair value of all of its assets and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  with any residual fair value being allocated to goodwill 
the fair value of the goodwill is then compared to the carrying amount to determine impairment 
an impairment charge will be recognized only when the implied fair value of a reporting unit  including goodwill  is less than its carrying amount 
in assessing the recoverability of the company s goodwill  management must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
in the event that a goodwill impairment charge is required  it would adversely affect the operating results and financial condition of the company
