the company experienced both price increases and supply limitations affecting several oil derived raw materials in  which is expected to carry forward into  but to date the company is receiving sufficient quantities of such materials to meet its reasonably foreseeable production requirements 
it is impossible to predict future shortages of raw materials or the impact any such shortages would have 
hurricanes katrina and rita resulted in tight supply conditions and significant increases in energy costs  fuel surcharges and prices for certain natural gas and petroleum related raw materials and their derivatives 
m has avoided disruption to its manufacturing operations through careful management of existing raw material inventories and development and qualification of additional supply sources 
m manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts  price protection agreements and forward physical contracts 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates also impact results  although the company minimizes this effect through hedging about half of this impact 
m will also continue  as it has for many years  to incur expenses insured and uninsured in managing its litigation and environmental contingencies

cumulative effect of accounting change as of december   the company adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations fin 
this accounting standard applies to the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and where the liability can be reasonably estimated 
conditional asset retirement obligations exist for certain of the company s long term assets 
the fair value of these obligations is recorded as liabilities on a discounted basis 
over time the liabilities are accreted for the change in the present value and the initial capitalized costs are depreciated over the useful lives of the related assets

 employers accounting for pensions and sfas no 
 employer s accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  which require that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
pension benefits associated with these plans are generally based primarily on each participant s years of service  compensation  and age at retirement or termination 
two critical assumptions  the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets  are important elements of expense and liability measurement 
the assumed health care trend rate is the most significant postretirement health care assumption 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in determining pension and postretirement health care liabilities and expenses 
the company determines the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities as of the december measurement date for the us pension and postretirement benefit plans 
the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the associated liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year 
in estimating this rate  the company looks at rates of return on fixed income investments of similar duration to the liabilities in the plan that receive high  investment grade ratings by recognized ratings agencies 
using these methodologies  the company determined a discount rate of to be appropriate as of december   which is a reduction of percentage points from the rate used as of december  as of december   the company converted to the rp retirement plans mortality table for calculating the year end us pension and postretirement obligations and expense 
the impact of this change increased the year end us projected benefit obligations for pension by million  the year end us accumulated benefit obligations for pension by million and the us accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by million 
this change will also increase pension expenses for by million and postretirement expenses by million 
a significant element in determining the company s pension expense in accordance with sfas no 
is the expected return on plan assets  which is based on historical results for similar allocations among asset classes 
for the us pension plan  the company s assumption for the expected return on plan assets was for and will remain at for refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for information on how this rate is determined 
the difference between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred and  under certain circumstances  amortized over future years of service 
therefore  the net deferral of past asset gains losses ultimately affects future pension expense 
this is also true of changes to actuarial assumptions 
as of december   the company had net unrecognized pension actuarial losses of billion and million for the us and international pension benefit plans  respectively  and billion for the postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plan 
these amounts represent potential future pension and postretirement expenses that would be amortized over average future service periods 
the average remaining service periods for us and international pension plans and the postretirement plans are years  years and years  respectively 
for the year ended december   the company recognized total consolidated pre tax pension expense after settlements  curtailments and special termination benefits of million  up from million in pension expense before settlements  curtailments and special termination benefits is anticipated to decrease to approximately million in for the pension plans  holding all other factors constant  an increase decrease in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets by percentage points would decrease increase us pension expense by approximately million for us pension plans and approximately million for international pension plans 
also  holding all other factors constant  an increase decrease in the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities by percentage points would decrease increase pension expense by approximately million for us pension plans and approximately million for international pension plans 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for details of the impact of a one percentage point change in assumed health care trend rates on the postretirement health care benefit expense and obligation 
potential asset impairment issues m net property  plant and equipment totaled approximately billion at december  management makes estimates and assumptions in preparing the consolidated financial statements for which actual results will emerge over long periods of time 
this includes the recoverability of long lived assets employed in the business  including assets of acquired businesses 
these estimates and assumptions are closely monitored by management and periodically adjusted as circumstances warrant 
for instance  expected asset lives may be shortened or an impairment recorded based on a change in the expected use of the asset or performance of the related business reporting unit 
m goodwill totaled approximately billion at december   which  based on impairment testing  is not impaired 
impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level 
reporting units are one level below the business segment level  but can be combined when reporting units within the same segment have similar economic characteristics 
m had reporting units at december  the majority of goodwill relates to and is assigned directly to a specific reporting unit 
an impairment loss generally would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using earnings for the reporting unit multiplied by a price earnings ratio for comparable industry groups  or by using a discounted cash flow analysis 
new accounting pronouncements as of december   the company adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations fin 
this accounting standard applies to the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and where the liability can be reasonably estimated 
conditional asset retirement obligations exist for certain of the company s long term assets 
the fair value of these obligations is recorded as liabilities on a discounted basis 
over time the liabilities are accreted for the change in the present value and the initial capitalized costs are depreciated over the useful lives of the related assets 
the adoption of fin resulted in the recognition of an asset retirement obligation liability of million and an after tax charge of million  which is reflected as a cumulative change in accounting principle in the consolidated statement of income 
the pro forma effect of applying this guidance in all prior periods presented was determined not to be material 
effective january   m adopted sfas no 
revised  share based payment  which requires m to expense stock based compensation expense 
the company is adopting sfas no 
r using the modified retrospective method 
all prior periods will be adjusted to give effect to the fair value based method of accounting for awards granted in fiscal years beginning on or after january  stock based compensation disclosures in note reflect pro forma expense of 
cents per diluted share in the impact of adopting sfas no 
r is estimated to be approximately 
per diluted share with an estimated per diluted share cost in the first quarter  an estimated per diluted share cost in the second quarter  and an estimated per diluted share cost in both the third and fourth quarters 
the pro forma impact of stock based compensation on net income and earnings per share provided in note for the years ended december   and  was recognized over the nominal vesting period  whereby if an employee retired before the end of the vesting period  the company would recognize any remaining unrecognized compensation cost at the date of retirement 
sfas no 
r requires recognition under a non substantive vesting period approach  requiring compensation expense recognition when an employee is eligible to retire 
m employees in the us are eligible to retire beginning at age and after having completed five years of service 
approximately to of the number of stock based compensation awards are made to this population 
the company will change to the non substantive vesting period approach for new stock compensation grants made after the company s adoption of sfas no 
r on january  therefore  primarily beginning in may with the annual management stock ownership program grant  immediate expensing of those stock based compensation awards granted to employees eligible to retire will result in a higher compensation expense than historically recognized in comparable prior periods 
the total expense in and beyond will depend on several variables  including the number of share based awards granted  the fair value of those awards  and the period the vesting of those awards is recognized over  therefore the actual expense may be different from this estimate 
additional information regarding these and other accounting pronouncements is included in note to the consolidated financial statements

the company uses various working capital measures that place emphasis and focus on certain working capital assets and liabilities 
these measures are not defined under us generally accepted accounting principles and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies 
one of the primary working capital measures m uses is a combined index  which includes accounts receivables  inventory and accounts payable

committed credit facilities of million are in place across several international subsidiary locations 
the company believes it is unlikely that its access to the commercial paper market will be restricted 
cash and cash equivalents and certain other current assets could provide additional liquidity to meet near term obligations  if necessary 
at year end  certain debt agreements million of dealer remarketable securities and million of esop debt had ratings triggers bbb baa or lower that would require repayment of debt 
the company currently has aa aa debt ratings 
in addition  the million  five year credit agreement requires m to maintain a capitalization ratio at no more than to at the end of each quarter

off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations as of december   the company had not utilized special purpose entities to facilitate off balance sheet financing arrangements 
m s accrued product warranty liabilities  recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as part of current and long term liabilities  are estimated at approximately million 
m does not consider this amount to be material 
the fair value of m guarantees of loans with third parties and other guarantee arrangements are not material 
in addition to guarantees  m  in the normal course of business  periodically enters into agreements that require m to indemnify either major customers or suppliers for specific risks  such as claims for injury or property damage arising out of m products or the negligence of m personnel  or claims alleging that m products infringe third party patents or other intellectual property 
while m s maximum exposure under these indemnification provisions cannot be estimated  these indemnifications are not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
a summary of the company s significant contractual obligations as of december   follows contractual obligations payments due by year after millions total long term debt  including current portion note interest on long term debt operating leases note capital leases note unconditional purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations long term debt payments due in include million of dealer remarketable securities final maturity and million of medium term notes final maturity 
these securities are classified as current portion of long term debt as the result of put provisions associated with these debt instruments 
the next date on which investors can require repurchase of the convertible notes is  thus in the above schedule this is considered due in final maturity 
unconditional purchase obligations are defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on the company 
included in the unconditional purchase obligations category above are certain obligations related to take or pay contracts  capital commitments  service agreements and utilities 
these estimates include both unconditional purchase obligations with terms in excess of one year and normal ongoing purchase obligations with terms of less than one year 
many of these commitments relate to take or pay contracts  in which m guarantees payment to ensure availability of products or services that are sold to customers 
the company expects to receive consideration products or services for these unconditional purchase obligations 
the purchase obligation amounts do not represent the entire anticipated purchases in the future  but represent only those items for which the company is contractually obligated 
the majority of m s products and services are purchased as needed  with no unconditional commitment 
for this reason  these amounts will not provide a reliable indicator of the company s expected future cash outflows on a stand alone basis 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company does not have a required minimum pension contribution obligation for its us plans in thus  company contributions to its us and international pension plans are expected to be largely discretionary in and future years 
contractual capital commitments are also included in the preceding table  but these commitments represent a small part of the company s expected capital spending in and beyond 
financial instruments the company enters into contractual derivative arrangements in the ordinary course of business to manage foreign currency exposure  interest rate risks and commodity price risks 
a financial risk management committee  composed of senior management  provides oversight for risk management and derivative activities 
this committee determines the company s financial risk policies and objectives  and provides guidelines for derivative instrument utilization 
this committee also establishes procedures for control and valuation  risk analysis  counterparty credit approval  and ongoing monitoring and reporting 
the company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts  options and swaps to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies and certain intercompany financing transactions 
in  the company increased the amount and duration of its foreign currency hedges to help lessen year over year impacts and to improve the predictability of future earnings 
however  this hedging program does not make m immune to currency impacts 
the company manages interest rate risks using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt 
to help manage borrowing costs  the company may enter into interest rate swaps 
under these arrangements  the company agrees to exchange  at specified intervals  the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional principal amount 
the company manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts  price protection agreements and forward physical contracts 
a variance co variance statistical modeling technique was used to test the company s exposure to changes in currency and interest rates and assess the risk of loss in after tax earnings of financial instruments  derivatives and underlying exposures outstanding at december  the model third party bank dataset used a confidence level over a month time horizon 
based on this analysis of the company s interest rate risks  possible increases in interest rates would not have a material adverse effect on after tax earnings million at december  and million at december  
a decrease in interest rates would have increased after tax earnings by million at december  based on this analysis of the primary foreign exchange risks  possible changes in foreign exchange rates would have adversely impacted after tax earnings by million at december  million at december  
a positive change in exchange rates would have benefited after tax earnings by million at december  when including certain commodity risks  possible changes in commodity rates would have adversely impacted after tax earnings by an additional million at december  an additional million at december  
a positive change in commodity rates would not have materially impacted after tax earnings at december  the model used analyzed over different currencies and five commodities  but does not purport to represent what actually will be experienced by the company 
this model does not include certain hedge transactions  because the company believes their inclusion would not materially impact the results 
the global exposures related to purchased components and materials are such that a one percent price change would result in a pre tax cost or savings of approximately million per year 
the global energy exposure is such that a price change would result in a pre tax cost or savings of approximately million per year 
derivative instruments are used to hedge less than two percent of the purchased components and materials exposure and are used to hedge approximately of this energy exposure
