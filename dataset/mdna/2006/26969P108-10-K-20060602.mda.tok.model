item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary strong residential construction and a recovering commercial construction demand in all of our markets helped to set record fiscal sales volume  revenues and earnings per share 
demand in all of our markets was strong as we reported increased sales volume in each of our segments for the fiscal year ended march  the majority of our earnings improvement was in the gypsum wallboard and cement operations 
fiscal revenues increased to million  net earnings were up to million and diluted earnings per share were up to 
gypsum wallboard sales volume was up and represented record volume for the company due to record industry demand while operating earnings increased due to a increase in average sales price 
fiscal was the th consecutive sold out year for our cement operations 
cement sales volume increased  and operating earnings increased from last year due to higher average net sales prices offset primarily by the impact of increased purchased cement volumes and costs 
paperboard reported record sales volume  however operating earnings declined due to reduced sales price and increased production costs  mainly natural gas 
concrete and aggregates operating earnings improved over last fiscal year due primarily to a record sales volume in concrete 
corporate expenses increased million due primarily to increased headcount and greater salary and benefit costs  including stock compensation 
manufacturing costs in fiscal were negatively impacted by increased natural gas  coal  power  paper fiber and maintenance costs 
demand for energy related products continued at a high level and prices for these products are expected to level off in fiscal ordinary maintenance costs are expected to remain flat in fiscal  although there will be some additional maintenance costs related to the completion of the illinois cement expansion project 
we operate in cyclical commodity businesses 
downturns in overall economic activity usually have a significant adverse effect on these businesses due to decreased demand and reduced pricing 
recently  wallboard demand has been favorably impacted by strong residential construction 
recent increases in interest rates are expected to bring a reduction in new residential construction activity  however  commercial and industrial activity  which are showing signs of improvement  may help to offset reduced demand in the residential construction sector if interest rates continue to increase 
cement demand continues to be positively impacted by a strong national highway funding program 
the funds allocated by congress in the new highway bill exceed the prior highway funding program 
strong demand from new housing and residential remodeling resulted in record wallboard consumption for calendar according to the gypsum association  national wallboard consumption of billion square feet for calendar  the highest level on record  was up from last year s consumption 
industry utilization rates have been at the level  resulting in a increase in our net wallboard pricing for fiscal we implemented price increases in april  june  september and  december and march us cement consumption continues to be strong 
total us cement shipments of approximately million short tons for calendar were a record high and were above calendar cement imports for calendar were million short tons  above last year s imports 
the us cement industry has been sold out for the last years as a result of a domestic capacity deficit 
current us demand requires imports of over to supplement domestic capacity 
the us cement industry is anticipating a tight supply of imported cement this year due to high freight rates and increasing consumption in world markets 
cement pricing has increased over prior year  the second straight year of price increases  reversing a slight decline over the prior three years 
we implemented cumulative price increases of between and per ton in all our markets during fiscal 
table of contents our recycled paperboard mill continued operational improvements and is now producing at above its original design capacity 
the company conducts one of its cement operations through a joint venture  texas lehigh cement company lp  which is located in buda  texas the joint venture 
the company owns a interest in the joint venture and accounts for its interest under the equity method of accounting 
however  for purposes of the cement segment information presented  the company proportionately consolidates its share of the joint venture s revenues and operating earnings  which is the way management organizes the segments within the company for making operating decisions and assessing performance 
see note h of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional segment information 
results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year consolidated results 
consolidated net revenues for fiscal were up from fiscal driven by higher sales prices and volumes in all segments  especially gypsum wallboard and cement 
fiscal operating earnings of million were up from million last fiscal year mainly due to increased gypsum wallboard and cement operating earnings

corporate overhead 
corporate general and administrative expenses for fiscal were million compared to million for last fiscal year 
the increase was primarily the result of increased headcount and higher compensation and benefit costs  including the expensing of employee stock compensation in accordance with a change in accounting standards 
other income 
other income consists of a variety of items that are non segment operating in nature and includes clinker sales income  non inventoried aggregates income  gypsum wallboard distribution center income  asset sales and other miscellaneous income and cost items 
net interest expense 
net interest expense of million for fiscal increased million from fiscal due to increased borrowings 
income taxes 
the effective tax rate for fiscal increased to from primarily due to an increase in state income tax expense partially offset by a revision of certain estimates utilized by the company for permanent items included within the corporate tax filings and the new domestic production activities deduction

revenues price increases throughout the year and record company wallboard shipments positively impacted revenues for fiscal as compared to fiscal pricing has continued to strengthen as consumption was at an all time high resulting in the near full capacity utilization of the us wallboard industry 
our sales volume of  mmsf represents a record for the company as the company operated at full capacity 
operating margins operating margins were impacted by increasing paper costs and transportation costs for raw materials  as well as natural gas costs which increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal on a per unit basis  freight costs  which are deducted to determine average net sales price  have increased from fiscal operating earnings for fiscal represented the highest earnings in company history 
outlook throughout fiscal industry utilization rates averaged about and as a result pricing has remained strong in all of the markets we serve 
we implemented a price increase in late march  which helped us achieve an average net sales price of approximately during april demand remains strong with supply being currently allocated 
single family residential housing is expected to decline during fiscal at an estimated rate of to  however we anticipate that commercial construction and repair and remodel demand will remain strong 
expected capacity additions during fiscal are not expected to be significant  therefore industry utilization  even with the anticipated decline in single family residential housing  is expected to remain high

operating margins operating margins increased during fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily due to increased sales prices 
the increases in sales prices were slightly offset by increased volumes of low margin purchased cement  which increased to  tons in fiscal from  tons in fiscal  an increase of 
additionally  fuel and energy costs increased over the prior year period due primarily to increased cost of petroleum coke and coal and electricity 
outlook us cement consumption remains strong as a result of strong federal and state infrastructure projects  strong housing activity and a recovering commercial construction market 
the passage of the billion  six year federal highway transportation bill safetea lu in july of represents a increase over the previous tea bill and is anticipated to further strengthen the long term demand for cement in the us the us government and the government of mexico have entered into an agreement providing for the elimination of the antidumping duties imposed by the us on cement imported from mexico 
the agreement provides for a three year transition period during which the volume of mexican cement imported into the southern tier of the us will be limited to million metric tons per year and the antidumping duty imposed on mexican cement will be set at per ton 
this is not expected to impact cement prices in the short term as the portland cement association estimates that the current industry wide domestic production capacity is short of domestic consumption 
additionally the major mexican cement producers also own a much larger percentage of us domestic production than previously when dumping occurred 
in the near term  we expect us cement pricing to remain stable or increase due to strong domestic consumption  increasing world demand and historically high international freight costs for imported cement 
the company has sold of its production for the last years and anticipates selling all of its fiscal production

aggregate pricing in austin has increased by during fiscal from fiscal operating margins increases in operating margins for concrete are due primarily to increased sales prices in fiscal as compared to fiscal  partially offset by increased raw materials cement and aggregates and delivery costs 
operating margins for aggregates declined for fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily due to significantly higher mobile equipment maintenance costs  as well as the timing of other plant maintenance projects 
outlook concrete pricing in the austin  texas market increased during fiscal as a result of increased construction activity in the region in both the commercial and residential sectors 
we expect improved pricing in the austin  texas market and continued strong pricing in the northern california market in fiscal aggregates pricing in the sacramento area is expected to continue to remain strong in the near term due primarily to demand outpacing capacity 
aggregates pricing in the austin  texas market is anticipated to increase moderately over the near term due to increased levels of construction activity in the austin area and a changing mix in the products sold

additionally  fiscal sales volume was a record high due to high levels of construction activity and favorable weather conditions in our markets 
the tight supply of cement in these markets resulted in sold out conditions at all of our plants for fiscal operating margins we continue to utilize purchased cement to supplement our production capacities in certain markets that we serve 
purchased cement tons were  tons in fiscal versus  tons in the prior year and impacted current year average cost per ton by per ton 
fuel and power costs increased over the prior year period due primarily to increased cost of petroleum coke and coal 
outlook us cement consumption was strong as a result of strong housing activity  a recovering commercial construction market and federal and state infrastructure projects 
us cement pricing increased due to strong domestic consumption  increasing world consumption and high international freight costs for imported cement 
total us shipments of million short tons for calendar  were above the same period in calendar cement imports for calendar  were million short tons or above last year s imports 
the company has been sold out for the last years and it is estimated that current industry wide domestic production capacity is short of domestic consumption

paperboard sales to our wallboard division were thousand tons at million compared to thousand tons at million for last year 
operating margins cost of sales per ton was impacted primarily by higher recovered fiber costs of per ton  higher fuel costs of per ton  higher chemical costs of per ton and higher inbound freight costs of per ton  offset positively by the mix of products sold and lower returns and allowances 
outlook as a result of strong market demand  capital improvements and improved operating efficiency  our paperboard mill is currently producing at of its original design capacity  and we anticipate continued strong demand for our products over the next twelve months

we recorded record volumes throughout fiscal  driven by the northern california market where demand outpaced supply 
pricing strengthened in northern california and was up as compared to the prior year 
aggregates volumes for the austin  texas market increased versus the prior year period due to higher sales of road base 
sales of road base were at lower prices than washed aggregates products and therefore negatively impacted the average texas sales price of aggregates by versus the prior year 
operating margins concrete margins were negatively impacted by increased raw materials cement and aggregates and delivery costs 
in both of our markets the majority of such costs were passed through to customers via price increases reflected above 
costs were impacted negatively by higher contract mining costs and higher maintenance costs versus last year 
aggregates costs per ton remained essentially flat due to fixed costs being spread over larger sales volumes 
outlook while concrete pricing in the austin  texas market increased slightly  pricing was below the national average and well below pricing in the northern california market 
we expect this trend to continue for the next twelve months 
additionally  we expect continued stable pricing in the northern california market 
we expect that aggregates pricing in the northern california area will continue to strengthen due primarily to demand outpacing capacity 
aggregates pricing in the austin  texas market increased moderately in fiscal due to increased levels of construction activity in the austin area and a changing mix in the products sold 

table of contents critical accounting policies certain of our critical accounting policies require the use of judgment in their application or require estimates of inherently uncertain matters 
although our accounting policies are in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles  a change in the facts and circumstances of the underlying transactions could significantly change the application of the accounting policies and the resulting financial statement impact 
listed below are those policies that we believe are critical and require the use of complex judgment in their application 
impairment of long lived assets 
we assess long lived assets in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
requires that long lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
these evaluations for impairment are significantly impacted by estimates of revenues  costs and expenses and other factors 
if these assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
goodwill 
pursuant to sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is no longer subject to amortization 
rather  goodwill is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
we have elected to test for goodwill impairment in the first quarter of each calendar year 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process  which requires management to make judgments in determining what assumptions to use in the calculation 
the first step of the process consists of estimating the fair value of each reporting unit based on a discounted cash flow model using revenues and profit forecasts and comparing those estimated fair values with the carrying value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment by determining a implied fair value of goodwill 
similar to the review for impairment of other long lived assets  evaluations for impairment are significantly impacted by estimates of future prices for our products  capital needs  economic trends and other factors 
environmental liabilities 
our operations are subject to state  federal and local environmental laws and regulations  which impose liability for cleanup or remediation of environmental pollution and hazardous waste arising from past acts and require pollution control and prevention  site restoration and operating permits and or approvals to conduct certain of its operations 
we record environmental accruals when it is probable that a reasonably estimable liability has been incurred 
environmental remediation accruals are based on internal studies and estimates  including shared financial liability with third parties 
environmental expenditures that extend the life  increase the capacity  improve the safety or efficiency of assets or mitigate or prevent future environmental contamination may be capitalized 
other environmental costs are expensed when incurred 
estimation of reserves and valuation allowances 
we evaluate the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances when we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligation to the company  the balance in the reserve for doubtful accounts is evaluated  and if determined to be deficient  a specific amount will be added to the reserve 
for all other customers  the reserve for doubtful accounts is determined by the length of time the receivables are past due or the status of the customer s financial condition

this increase was offset by the change in working capital  primarily the increase in accounts receivable 
working capital at march  was million compared to million at march  the increase resulted primarily from a reduction of million in notes payable and an increase of million in cash related to the senior note borrowing during fiscal the remaining difference was due primarily to the million increase in accounts and notes receivable 
total debt increased from million at march   to million at march  due to the senior note borrowing 
debt to capitalization at march   was compared to at march  based on our financial condition and results of operations as of and for the year ended march   along with the projected net earnings for fiscal  we believe that our internally generated cash flow coupled with funds available under various credit facilities will enable us to provide adequately for our current operations  dividends  capital expenditures and future growth through the end of fiscal the company was in compliance at march  and during the fiscal year ended march   with all the terms and covenants of its credit agreements and expects to be in compliance during the next months 
cash and cash equivalents totaled million at march   compared to million at march  debt financing activities

our obligations under the note purchase agreement and the senior notes are equal in right of payment with all other senior  unsecured debt of the company  including our debt under the bank credit facility 
the note purchase agreement contains customary restrictive covenants  including covenants that place limits on our ability to encumber our assets  to incur additional debt  to sell assets  or to merge or consolidate with third parties  as well as certain cross covenants with the bank credit facility 
the company paid all outstanding amounts and terminated its trade receivables securitization facility the receivables securitization facility in december the receivables securitization facility had been fully consolidated on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets prior to cancellation 
other than the bank credit facility  the company has no other source of committed external financing in place 
in the event the bank credit facility was terminated  no assurance can be given as to the company s ability to secure a new source of financing 
consequently  if a balance is outstanding on the bank credit facility at the time of termination  and an alternative source of financing cannot be secured  it would have a material adverse impact on the company 
none of the company s debt is rated by the rating agencies

each quarterly dividend payment is subject to review and approval by our board of directors  and we will continue to evaluate our dividend payment amount on an ongoing basis 
during january we announced an increase in our annual dividend from to per share  beginning with the april dividend payment 
capital expenditures 
the following table compares capital expenditures for the fiscal years ended ended march  dollars in thousands land and quarries plants buildings  machinery and equipment total capital expenditures historically  we have financed such expenditures with cash from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we expect to make capital expenditures of approximately million during fiscal the increase in capital spending is due primarily to our beginning construction on the wallboard plant in south carolina 
contractual obligations 
the company has certain contractual obligations covering manufacturing  transportation and certain other facilities and equipment 
future payments due  aggregated by type of contractual obligation are set forth as follows payments due by period less than more than total year years years years dollars in thousands contractual obligations long term debt note payable operating leases purchase obligations total purchase obligations are non cancelable agreements to purchase coal and natural gas  to pay royalty amounts and capital expenditure commitments 
the company expects to sign a contract during fiscal relating to the construction of the wallboard plant in georgetown  south carolina 
based on our current estimates  we do not anticipate making any additional contributions to our defined benefit plans for fiscal year 
table of contents inflation and changing prices inflation has not been a significant factor in the us economy as the rate of increase has moderated during the last several years 
the consumer price index rose approximately in calendar  in  and in prices of materials and services  with the exception of power  natural gas  coal  coke  and transportation freight have remained relatively stable over the three year period 
during fiscal  the consumer price index for energy and transportation rose approximately and  respectively 
strict cost control and improved productivity have minimized the impact of inflation on our operations  as has the ability to recover increasing costs by obtaining higher sales prices 
the ability to increase sales prices to cover future increases varies with the level of activity in the construction industry  the number  size  and strength of competitors and the availability of products to supply a local market
