the impact of sox is wide ranging as it applies to all public companies and imposes significant new requirements for public company governance and disclosure requirements

it backed these requirements with new sec enforcement tools  increased criminal penalties for federal mail  wire and securities fraud  and created new criminal penalties for document and record destruction in connection with federal investigations 
it also increased the opportunity for more private litigation by lengthening the statute of limitations for securities fraud claims and providing new federal corporate whistleblower protection

back to table of contents corresponding increase in our allowance for credit losses  expressed as a percentage of total loans  resulted directly from the evaluation of loans discussed previously 
management greatly expanded the number of loans that were evaluated for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
these extensive evaluations were augmented by third party reviews 
this extensive evaluation process resulted in significantly more loans being evaluated for impairment in accordance with sfas as of december   than was the case at december  management also determined that  due to the specific facts and circumstances identified during these impairment evaluations  the resulting increase in the allowance for credit losses was properly recorded in as of december   management has concluded that the allowance for credit losses for the bank is adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
noninterest income 
noninterest income of million in was  or  less than the previous year amount of million

market risk market risk is the possible chance of loss from unfavorable changes in market prices and rates 
these changes may result in a reduction of current and future period net interest income  which is the favorable spread earned from the excess of interest income on interest earning assets  over interest expense on interest bearing liabilities

effects of inflation inflation affects financial institutions in ways that are different from most commercial and industrial companies  which have significant investments in fixed assets and inventories 
the effect of inflation on interest rates can materially impact bank operations  which rely on net interest margins as a major source of earnings 
noninterest expense  such as salaries and wages  occupancy and equipment cost  are also negatively affected by inflation 
application of critical accounting policies the company s accounting policies are fundamental to understanding management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition 
the company s significant accounting policies are discussed in detail in note of the consolidated financial statements of the company s annual report 
the following is a summary of the allowance for credit losses  one of the most complex and judgmental accounting policies of the company 
the allowance for credit losses  which is utilized to absorb actual losses in the loan portfolio  is maintained at a level consistent with management s best estimate of probable credit losses incurred as of the balance sheet date 
the company s allowance for credit losses is also analyzed quarterly by management 
this analysis includes a methodology that separates the total loan portfolio into homogeneous loan classifications for purposes of evaluating risk 
the required allowance is calculated by applying a risk adjusted reserve requirement to the dollar volume of loans within a homogenous group 
major loan portfolio subgroups include risk graded commercial loans  mortgage loans  home equity loans  retail loans and retail credit lines 
management also analyzes the loan portfolio on an ongoing basis to evaluate current risk levels  and risk grades are adjusted accordingly 
while management uses the best information to make evaluations  future adjustments may be necessary  if economic or other conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the possible chance of loss from unfavorable changes in market prices and rates 
these changes may result in a reduction of current and future period net interest income  which is the favorable spread earned from the excess of interest income on interest earning assets  over interest expense on interest bearing liabilities 
interest rate risk management is a part of the company s overall asset liability management process 
the primary oversight of asset liability management rests with the company s asset and liability committee  which is comprised of senior management and members of the company s board of directors 
the committee meets on a regular basis to review the asset liability management activities of the company 
back to table of contents and monitor compliance with established policies 
an independent member of the board of directors chairs the committee and reports on its activities to the full board 
a primary objective of interest rate sensitivity management is to ensure the stability and quality of the company s primary earnings component  net interest income 
this process involves monitoring the company s balance sheet in order to determine the potential impact that changes in the interest rate environment may have on net interest income 
rate sensitive assets and liabilities have interest rates that are subject to change within a specific time period  due to either maturity or to contractual agreements which allow the instruments to reprice prior to maturity 
interest rate sensitivity management seeks to ensure that both assets and liabilities react to changes in interest rates within a similar time period  thereby minimizing the risk to net interest income

the interest sensitivity gap is the difference between repricing assets and repricing liabilities for a particular time period 
the table  interest sensitivity analysis  indicates a ratio of rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities within one year at december   to be x 
this ratio indicates that a larger balance of assets compared to liabilities  could potentially reprice during the upcoming twelve month period 
included in rate sensitive liabilities are certain deposit accounts now  mmi  and savings that are subject to immediate withdrawal and repricing  yet have no stated maturity 
these balances are presented in the category that management believes best identifies their actual repricing patterns 
this analysis assumes of now and savings accounts  and of mmi accounts  reprice within one year  and the remaining balances reprice after one year 
the overall risk to net interest income is also influenced by the company s level of variable rate loans 
these are loans with a contractual interest rate tied to an index  such as the prime rate 
a portion of these loans may reprice on multiple occasions during a one year period due to changes in the underlying rate index 

back to table of contents approximately of the total loan portfolio has a variable rate and reprices in accordance with the underlying rate index subject to terms of individual note agreements 
in addition to the traditional gap analysis  the company also utilizes a computer based interest rate risk simulation model 
this comprehensive model includes rate sensitivity gap analysis  rate shock net interest income analysis  and present value of equity analysis  under various rate shock scenarios 
the company uses this model to monitor interest rate risk on a quarterly basis and to detect trends that may affect the overall net interest income for the company 
this simulation incorporates the dynamics of balance sheet and interest rate changes and calculates the related effect on net interest income 
as a result  this analysis more accurately projects the risk to net interest income over the upcoming month period 
the company s asset liability policy provides guidance for levels of interest rate risk and potential remediations  if necessary  to mitigate excessive levels of risk 
the modeling results indicate the company is subject to an acceptable level of interest rate risk 
the company considers interest rate risk to be its most significant market risk  which could potentially have the greatest impact on operating earnings 
the company is asset sensitive  which means that falling interest rates could result in a reduced amount of net interest income 
the company is not subject to other types of market risk  such as foreign currency exchange rate risk  commodity or equity price risk
