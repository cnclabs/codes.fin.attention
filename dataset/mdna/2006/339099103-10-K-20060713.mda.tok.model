units sold by the retail business were retail single section multi section includes sales of slide in truck camper units in fiscal years ended and overview fleetwood is one of the nation s leaders in producing both recreational vehicles and manufactured housing 
the rv group sold  and  recreational vehicles in fiscal and  respectively 
in calendar  we had a percent share of the overall recreational vehicle retail market  consisting of a percent share of the motor home market  an percent share of the travel trailer market and a percent share of the folding trailer market 
the housing group produced and shipped  and  manufactured homes in fiscal and  respectively  and was the second largest producer of hud code homes in the united states in terms of units sold  including intercompany sales 
the supply group operates three supply companies that provide components for our manufactured housing and recreational vehicle operations  while also generating outside sales 
our business began in producing travel trailers and quickly evolved to what are now termed manufactured homes 
we re entered the recreational vehicle business with the acquisition of a travel trailer operation in our manufacturing activities are conducted in states within the us  and to a much lesser extent in canada 
we distribute our manufactured products primarily through a network of independent dealers throughout the united states and canada 
in fiscal  we entered the manufactured housing retail business through a combination of acquisitions and internal development of new retail sales centers 
we later established a financial services subsidiary to provide finance and insurance products to customers of the retail operation 
in march  we announced our intention to sell the retail and finance businesses so that we could focus on our core businesses of rv and housing manufacturing and in july and august  the majority of the assets of these businesses were sold 
the retail and finance businesses are presented as discontinued operations throughout this annual report on form k 
critical accounting policies our financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
this requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and notes 
we evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis and use historical experience factors and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following is a list of the accounting policies that we believe reflect our more significant judgments and estimates  and that could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
revenue recognition revenue for manufacturing operations is generally recorded when all of the following conditions have been met an order for a product has been received from a dealer  written or oral approval for payment has been received from the dealer s flooring institution  a common carrier signs the delivery ticket accepting responsibility for the product as agent for the dealer  and the product is removed from fleetwood s property for delivery to the dealer who placed the order 
most manufacturing sales are made on cash terms  with most dealers financing their purchases under flooring arrangements with banks or finance companies 
products are not ordinarily sold on consignment  dealers do not ordinarily have the right to return products  and dealers are typically responsible for interest costs to floorplan lenders 
on average  we receive payments from floorplan lenders on products sold to dealers within days of the invoice date 
warranty we typically provide customers of our products with a one year warranty covering defects in material or workmanship with longer warranties on certain structural components 
we record a liability based on our best estimate of the amounts necessary to resolve future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date 
factors we use in estimating the warranty liability include a history of units sold to customers  the average cost incurred to repair a unit and a profile of the distribution of warranty expenditures over the warranty period 
a significant increase in dealer shop rates  the cost of parts or the frequency of claims could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period or periods in which such claims or additional costs materialize 
insurance reserves generally  we are self insured for health benefits  workers compensation  products liability and personal injury insurance 
under these plans  liabilities are recognized for claims incurred including those incurred but not reported  changes in the reserves related to prior claims and an administration fee 
at the time a claim is filed  a liability is estimated to settle the claim 
the liability for workers compensation claims is guided by state statute 
factors considered in establishing the estimated liability for products liability and personal injury claims are the nature of the claim  the geographical region in which the claim originated  loss history  severity of the claim  the professional judgment of our legal counsel  and inflation 
any material change in these factors could have an adverse impact on our operating results 
we maintain excess liability insurance with outside insurance carriers to minimize our risks related to catastrophic claims 
deferred taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between income and expenses reported for financial reporting and tax reporting 
we are required to record a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we historically had considered relevant positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  prudent and feasible tax planning strategies  projected future taxable income and recent financial performance 
since we have had cumulative losses in recent years  the accounting guidance suggests that we should not look to future earnings to support the realizability of the net deferred tax asset 
beginning in fiscal  we concluded that a partial valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset was appropriate 
at april   as part of our periodic assessments of the adequacy of the valuation allowance  the company determined that the estimated benefits from available tax strategies were sufficient to support a deferred tax asset of million and during fiscal recorded a net adjustment to the valuation allowance of million with a corresponding charge to the provision for income taxes 
the primary reason for this reduction was an increase  during the first quarter  in the market value of our convertible trust preferred securities of fleetwood capital trust 
at that time  improved expectations of the company s outlook  the announcement of a proposed exchange offer transaction relating to the convertible trust preferred securities and some upward movement in our stock price contributed to a lower discount from par value and diminished the magnitude of unrealized taxable gains in these securities 
this was partially offset by a fourth quarter increase in unrealized taxable gains on real estate holdings 
the remaining book value of the net deferred tax asset was supported by the availability of various tax strategies  which  if executed  were expected to generate sufficient taxable income to realize the book value of the remaining asset 
we continue to believe that the combination of relevant positive and negative factors will enable us to realize the full value of the deferred tax assets  however  it is possible that the extent and availability of tax planning strategies will change over time and impact this evaluation 
if  after future assessments of the realizability of our deferred tax assets  we determine that further adjustment is required  we will record the provision or benefit in the period of such determination 
legal proceedings we are regularly involved in legal proceedings in the ordinary course of our business 
because of the uncertainties related to the outcome of the litigation and range of loss on cases other than breach of warranty  we are generally unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome 
in other cases  including products liability and personal injury cases  we prepare estimates based on historical experience  the professional judgment of our legal counsel  and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to pending litigation and revise our estimates 
such revisions and any actual liability that greatly exceeds our estimates could materially impact our results of operations and financial position 
repurchase commitments producers of recreational vehicles and manufactured housing customarily enter into repurchase agreements with lending institutions that provide wholesale floorplan financing to independent dealers 
the company s agreements generally provide that  in the event of a default by a dealer in its obligation to these credit sources  fleetwood will repurchase product 
with most repurchase agreements  our obligation ceases when the amount for which we are contingently liable to the lending institution has been outstanding for more than  or months  depending on the terms of the agreement 
the contingent liability under these agreements approximates the outstanding principal balance owed by the dealer for units subject to the repurchase agreement less any scheduled principal payments waived by the lender 
although the maximum potential contingent repurchase liability approximated million for inventory at manufactured housing dealers and million for inventory at rv dealers as of april   the risk of loss is reduced by the potential resale value of any products that are subject to repurchase  and is spread over numerous dealers and financial institutions 
the gross repurchase obligation will vary depending on the season and the level of dealer inventories 
typically  the fiscal third quarter repurchase obligation will be greater than other periods due to high dealer inventories 
the rv repurchase obligation is greater than the manufactured housing obligation due to motor homes having a higher average selling price per unit and dealers holding more units in inventory 
past losses under these agreements have not been significant and lender repurchase demands have been funded out of working capital 
in the past three fiscal years we have had the following repurchase activity dollars in millions  units repurchase amount loss recognized business outlook industry motor home sales slowed considerably in calendar from s record pace 
however  it is anticipated that industry motor home shipments will post a much smaller decline in compared to  with most of the continued weakness in the class a segment 
we believe that sales are being adversely affected by concerns about rising interest rates  volatile fuel prices and diminished home equity financings 
for the calendar year through april  industry motor home retail sales were down percent while we were down percent 
our slight market share erosion is primarily concentrated in the class c and high line diesel segments 
our decline in class c market share is primarily due to the fact that we do not currently participate in certain entry level and perceived fuel efficient product niches 
as calendar continues  we expect to benefit from the recently introduced terra fiesta lx low end class a gas product offering 
in the class c category  we are assessing potential plans for new products that could compete in the entry level and fuel efficient categories 
our inventories of finished goods continue to be at reasonable levels and production rates have been adjusted to support underlying retail sales 
our travel trailer operations received an uplift from disaster relief orders throughout much of fiscal  although this activity declined during the fourth quarter 
overall industry travel trailer retail sales were percent higher through calendar april compared to the same period in the prior year 
our market share has deteriorated from percent to percent over this same period  generally as a result of less competitive product offerings and erosion in dealer confidence that have caused some contraction in our shelf space on dealers lots in certain markets 
initiatives to reverse these trends are well underway and are expected to take effect over time 
our order backlogs for dealer business continue to be at significantly elevated levels compared to the prior year primarily due to good acceptance of new floor plans introduced late in model year  early introduction of the model year nitrous product line  the recent restructuring of the sales organization to a brand specific focus  and  to a lesser extent  dealer inventory replenishment due to disaster relief activity 
most importantly  we are now well into our model year product launch 
our overall focus is to design each of our new products with the appropriate combination of features and benefits that will offer our customers the highest value relative to our competition 
we will launch more than completely new floor plans with of those being fifth wheel products  the market segment where we have the lowest market share 
in addition  we will introduce new brand extensions that target specific industry market segments that will help us participate in a broader market 
as the new model introductions will be spread over an extended length of time  we do not anticipate immediate improvements to our volume and market share but believe  over the ensuing year  that as the new products gain favor with dealers and retail customers  we will regain shelf space and bolster our shipments 
in anticipation of future growth as well as to reduce plant manufacturing complexities  we reopened a travel trailer plant in edgerton  ohio  that is now operational and successfully produced a portion of the remaining fema trailer order during the fourth quarter 
in the longer run  the additional production line will allow us to simplify the production at two neighboring plants as each will specialize in building trailers of a specific construction type 
we believe that collectively  our initiatives will be rewarded over the longer term by improved shipments  higher margins and a recovery in market share 
in light of the continued slow market for motor homes  however  we are closely monitoring current market conditions for travel trailers 
our market share in folding trailers continues to improve and through april of the current calendar year  market share has increased to percent from percent for the same period in the prior year due to fleetwood s retail unit sales rising by percent  compared to an industry decline of percent 
we continue to take significant actions to improve the cost structure and streamline manufacturing operations in the folding trailer business in response to the continued weakness in the overall industry segment 
as this segment recovers  we will be well positioned to capitalize on the increased demand 
quality processes continue to be overhauled for the entire rv business and  although improvements are already apparent in our finished products  the full financial benefits will only be realized over the longer term through lower warranty and service costs 
we have renewed our focus on dealer development activities and have restructured our sales organizations to focus on individual brands and or products in order to address the deterioration of our distribution network and help to ensure each of our products is being appropriately represented  especially travel trailers and east coast class c products 
favorable demographics suggest sustainable growth will likely be realized for rvs at least through the end of the decade as baby boomers reach the age brackets that historically have accounted for the bulk of retail rv sales 
additionally  younger buyers are also becoming interested in the rv lifestyle 
these conclusions receive strong support from the university of michigan national survey of recreation vehicle owners  sponsored by the recreation vehicle industry association 
the manufactured housing market has experienced a steep decline that began in before beginning to stabilize at or near a year low in competition from repossessed homes  as well as relatively high retail interest rates  more stringent lending standards and a shortage of retail financing for manufactured housing have adversely affected the industry 
overall  the industry appears to have stabilized  but market conditions by region are mixed 
traditional manufactured housing markets  such as texas  the midwest and parts of the southeast  have performed poorly in the last several years  although they too appear to have stabilized more recently 
industry shipments increased by percent in calendar  but were essentially flat excluding sales of homes that were built to fema specifications for disaster relief 
industry shipments of units for disaster relief in the last two months of calendar caused our market share to decline from percent to percent for that year 
the sale of the company s retail operations resulted in a million decline in sales from fiscal to fiscal of the stores that were sold in august  approximately stores were immediately closed by the buyer 
sales lost as a result of closed stores totaled million and sales to stores that remained open decreased by million 
the closure of retail stores and reduced purchases by the remaining operating stores will continue to impact the company s sales volume and market share until the closed outlets are fully replaced or augmented 
we also had fewer sales this year  as compared to fiscal  through non traditional channels  primarily to national operators of manufactured home communities 
disaster relief orders from government agencies kept plants near capacity through the end of the calendar year  but current demand in the gulf coast region has been lower than anticipated as residents wait for the completion of clean up efforts  insurance reimbursements and floodplain determinations 
the sale of our network of company owned stores  which had a high concentration in these regions  may impact our ability to participate in any upswing in these areas until we are able to fully rebuild our distribution network 
some markets in the west  typically those that were less affected by high repossession levels and retail financing losses  remain healthy  but appear to be less robust in recent months than they were previously 
the outlook in remaining areas continues to be uncertain 
we are encouraged  however  by the excellent reviews our new regionally designed homes are receiving from dealers and consumers alike  although dealers have been generally slow to add to inventory by stocking our new models until existing inventory is sold 
inventories of foreclosed homes have continued to decline  however  we expect to continue to compete with sales of repossessed homes in weaker geographical areas in the near term 
lenders continue to provide manufactured housing retail financing in limited amounts and use stringent underwriting practices and higher interest rates than for a mortgage on a traditional site built home 
availability of financing has stabilized and may even be showing some signs of modest improvement 
depending on the extent of the financing actually generated  it is anticipated that manufactured housing industry conditions should improve  albeit slowly 
we will continue to pursue other opportunities to supplement our business  such as increasing emphasis on modular homes and sales to community and park operators  land developers and the military 
longer term demand for affordable housing is expected to grow as a result of the rebuilding requirements in the gulf states  greater numbers of baby boomers reaching retirement age and the escalating cost of site built homes and conventional mortgage interest rates 
improvements in engineering and design continue to position manufactured homes as a viable option in meeting the demands for affordable housing in new markets  such as suburban tracts and military sites  as well as in existing markets such as rural areas and manufactured housing communities and parks 
following the sale of our retail housing and financial services businesses during fiscal  the shift in focus back to our core manufacturing operations is essentially complete 
at the same time  regions and individual manufacturing facilities have been given greater autonomy regarding product and operational decisions 
we believe that our current  or soon to be introduced products for all areas of our business are feature rich  innovative and price competitive 
as a result  we generally expect to improve our market position over the course of the next fiscal year 
restructuring actions to date have resulted in a more cost effective management structure with a greater emphasis on sustainable profitability 
however  sluggish industry demand for motor homes and manufactured housing  combined with temporary parts shortages on some of our new travel trailer models  will place additional pressure on first quarter earnings and  as a result  we currently expect to be below breakeven at the operating income line 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain statements of operations data expressed as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated fiscal years ended april net sales cost of products sold gross profit operating expenses other operating expenses  net operating income loss other income expense investment income interest expense other  net income loss from continuing operations before income taxes provision for income taxes net income loss from continuing operations discontinued operations net loss consolidated results fiscal year compared with fiscal year consolidated results the following table presents net loss and diluted loss per share for fiscal and amounts in thousands  except per share data fiscal years ended april amount of net sales amount of net sales change change net loss from continuing operations net loss diluted loss per share the substantial decrease to the net loss from continuing operations during fiscal stems primarily from improved operating results further enhanced by lower net interest expense and partially offset by an increase in non cash tax expenses 
the decrease in our net loss for this fiscal year was even more pronounced due to the sizable reduction to losses from discontinued operations following the sale of our retail and financial services business in august net sales the following table presents consolidated net sales by group for fiscal and amounts in thousands amount of net sales amount of net sales change change rv group housing group supply group intercompany sales net sales consolidated net sales increased by percent or million 
rv sales were generally weak throughout the year  although sales of travel trailers for use as emergency shelter in the gulf coast region provided a boost to revenues and reduced the year over year decline to percent 
manufactured housing revenues increased by percent  also assisted by the sale of units intended for use as emergency shelter  partially offset by lower sales to former company owned retail stores  a number of which were closed following their sale 
intercompany sales to the retail housing business  prior to its sale in august  are excluded from consolidated revenues

a significant focus was placed on more effectively managing production schedules and improving plant efficiencies 
the additional unit volume from the production of emergency shelter units also enabled plants to operate with higher capacity utilization  particularly those in the travel trailer business  where margins had previously been negatively impacted from producing lower volumes of a wide variety of unique products 
also  the prior year margins were impacted by inefficiencies associated with vacillating rv production rates during the second half of fiscal in order to align inventories and supply with weakening demand 
certain areas of our business continued to experience rising raw material costs as prices for oil  aluminum  copper and other commodities increased 
higher fuel prices also contributed to an increase in shipping costs 
operating expenses the following table presents operating expenses for fiscal and amounts in thousands fiscal years ended april amount of net sales amount of net sales change change selling warranty and service general and administrative operating expenses a restructuring of the housing sales organization contributed to a reduction in selling costs combined with lower overall expenditures on strategic ventures and marketing initiatives 
warranty expenses for both groups declined due to lower incurred warranty costs combined with lower reserves 
responsibility for service and warranty work was transitioned back to the manufactured housing and travel trailer plants during the year and this  combined with initiatives to manage quality issues  had a positive impact on costs in this area 
general and administrative expenses decreased due to lower workers compensation costs  consulting costs and headcount reductions  partially offset by higher variable compensation costs 
other operating expenses  net other operating expenses  net in fiscal consisted of impairment charges of million and severance costs of million  partially offset by net gains on sale of fixed assets of million 
other operating expenses  net in fiscal consisted of litigation charges of million  including charges related to a million judgment in the dispute with coleman  as well as impairment charges of million and severance costs of million  partially offset by net gains on sale of fixed assets of million 
other income expense other income expense improved by million to million in fiscal when compared to the previous year 
the change was attributable to costs of million in the prior year related to transactions involving our trust preferred securities  as well as lower borrowings and higher invested balances at higher interest rates in the current year versus the prior year 
recreational vehicles the following table presents rv group net sales by division for fiscal and amounts in thousands amount of net sales amount of net sales change change motor homes travel trailers folding trailers net sales in calendar  our motor home market share decreased slightly to percent and retail unit sales decreased by percent compared to calendar in fiscal compared to fiscal  wholesale revenues were down by a greater percent 
this was largely in line with the experience of the whole industry  which was impacted by adverse trends in consumer confidence stemming mostly from volatile fuel prices 
in calendar  the company experienced market share growth in the class c and diesel segments with market erosion in the class a gas segment  primarily in the entry level and high line gas products 
travel trailer sales were up percent in fiscal compared to fiscal wholesale shipments benefited from the sale of emergency living units  which generated million of additional revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal sales to our traditional dealer network  in terms of units  decreased by approximately percent and underlying retail unit sales were down by percent in calendar compared to the previous year 
this continued a trend of eroding market share  particularly in the higher priced fifth wheel travel trailer class to percent and conventional travel trailers to percent  that can be attributed to a mismatch of value and features in our products  relative to the competition 
folding trailer sales were down percent  but market share increased slightly to percent while the industry was down nearly percent for calendar a prolonged industry decline slowed considerably as this market showed some signs of recovery by the end of the fiscal year 
we continue to maintain a dominant market share in this segment 
the rv group generated  of operating income in fiscal  compared to an operating loss of million in the prior fiscal year 
despite sales that were lower by percent  higher margins and lower operating expenses contributed to the improvement in operating results

revenues in fiscal were up percent from the prior year  and included million of intercompany sales to company owned retail sales centers 
manufacturing unit volume decreased percent to  homes  and the total number of housing sections was down percent to  due to a shift in sales mix toward single section homes 
multi section homes represented percent of factory shipments for the fiscal year versus percent last year 
sales volume was improved over the prior year because of significant sales of emergency shelter product in response to hurricane damage in the gulf coast region 
this was partially offset by lower sales to manufactured housing community developers and to divested company owned stores 
gross profit margin of percent of sales was a percent increase over the prior year 
operating costs decreased million or percent as a result of lower selling and product warranty expenses following a reorganization of these functions 
other operating expenses also decreased by million  primarily due to charges in the prior year  including million of impairment  million for severance and million in litigation costs 
overall results improved from an operating profit of million to million 
supply operations including intercompany sales  our supply group contributed revenues of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  of which million and million  respectively  were sales to third party customers 
operating income from sales to third party customers declined from million to million primarily as a result of lower margins and a gain on the sale of the drapery operation in the prior year 
discontinued operations in march  we announced our intention to exit the manufactured housing retail and financial services businesses and the majority of the assets of these businesses were sold by august these businesses are presented as discontinued operations in the company s financial statements

this was partially offset by lower interest expense of million due to the retirement or redemption of a portion of our convertible subordinated debentures in transactions that straddled the end of the prior fiscal year and a lower tax provision  which was adversely impacted in by an adjustment to the deferred tax valuation allowance 
following the announcement in march that we planned to sell the retail housing and financial services subsidiaries  these businesses were designated as discontinued operations 
the loss from discontinued operations in the fiscal totaled million  including non cash impairment charges of million to record assets held for sale at their fair value less costs to sell

rv sales remained strong in the early part of fiscal but weakened during the second half of the year 
the prospect of softening retail sales caused dealers to maintain or reduce their inventories 
this combined with a decline in market share in the towable division  contributed to a percent reduction in rv wholesale revenues 
manufactured housing revenues increased by percent as a result of improving industry demand in certain regional markets  higher prices  improved market share and significant sales in florida in response to hurricane damage

a portion of this decline resulted from inefficiencies associated with vacillating rv production rates in the third and fourth quarters in order to adjust supply to accommodate weakening demand 
however  we did not moderate rv production quickly enough in response to signs of weakening rv sales during the second and third fiscal quarters  causing disruption to production schedules throughout the remainder of the fiscal year 
all areas of our business experienced rising raw material costs as prices for lumber  steel  aluminum and other commodities increased 
travel trailer operations were significantly impacted by these increases  combined with competitive pricing pressures and increased sales incentives  resulting in margin compression 
higher fuel prices also contributed to an increase in shipping costs 
operating expenses the following table presents operating expenses for fiscal and amounts in thousands amount of net sales amount of net sales change change selling warranty and service general and administrative operating expenses higher housing sales  in conjunction with a variety of strategic ventures and marketing initiatives  accounted for most of the increase in selling expenses 
warranty expenses for the rv group increased by million due to higher incurred warranty costs combined with higher reserves 
housing group warranty expenses also increased year over year since the prior year was reduced by positive reserve adjustments following a period of sustained cost reductions 
general and administrative expenses were up due to increases in group health insurance expense  workers compensation costs  the costs of computer system upgrades and conversions  product development efforts and the costs of compliance related to the sarbanes oxley legislation

the sale of the drapery facility along with two idle plants generated million of the gain 
other income expense other income expense decreased by million from million to million in fiscal when compared to the previous year 
net interest expense was down by million primarily as a result of the conversion or redemption of the convertible preferred securities of fleetwood capital trusts ii and iii  partially offset by the issuance of the million convertible senior subordinated debentures 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we entered into various privately negotiated transactions with the holders of convertible trust preferred securities of fleetwood capital trust iii to convert their securities to common stock prior to their redemption dates 
we paid a premium of million in excess of interest accrued that is included in other  net 
a premium of million resulted from similar transactions in the first quarter of fiscal with the holders of convertible preferred securities of fleetwood capital trust ii

underlying retail unit sales were up by percent in calendar  compared to the prior year 
lost market share  particularly in the higher priced fifth wheel travel trailer class  added to the deterioration in wholesale results 
a continuing decline in folding trailer sales was consistent with the overall market decline for these products  although we continue to maintain dominant market share in this segment 
the rv group incurred a million operating loss in fiscal  compared to operating income of million in the prior fiscal year 
the deterioration was mainly due to lower sales and margins in all divisions combined with the previously mentioned overproduction earlier in the year

in november  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp sfas r  transition election related to accounting for the tax effects of share based payment awards 
fsp sfas r provides an elective alternative transition method  to sfas r  in accounting for the tax effects of share based payment awards to employees 
the elective method utilizes a computational component that establishes a beginning balance of the additional paid in capital apic pool related to employee compensation and a simplified method to determine the subsequent impact on the apic pool of employee awards that are fully vested and outstanding upon the adoption of sfas r 
the impact on the apic pool of awards partially vested upon  or granted after  the adoption of sfas r should be determined in accordance with the guidance in sfas r 
we do not intend to adopt the transition election of fsp sfas r the company expects to adopt sfas no 
r  effective with the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal adoption of the standard is currently expected to reduce fiscal earnings by an amount consistent with the reductions shown in recent pro forma disclosures provided under the provisions of sfas no 
application of this pronouncement requires significant judgment regarding the assumptions used in the selected option pricing model  including stock price volatility and employee exercise behavior 
most of these inputs are either highly dependent on the current economic environment at the date of grant or forward looking expectations projected over the expected term of the award 
as a result  the actual impact of adoption on future earnings could differ significantly from our current estimate

fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  which expands upon and strengthens existing accounting guidance concerning when a company should consolidate in its financial statements the assets  liabilities and activities of another entity 
a revised interpretation no 
was issued in december fin r 
prior to the issuance of fin  a company generally included another entity in its consolidated financial statements only if it controlled the entity through voting interests 
fin now requires a variable interest entity  as defined in fin  to be consolidated by a company only if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
fin also requires disclosures about variable interest entities that the company is not required to consolidate but in which it has a significant variable interest 
the company owned three delaware business trusts that were established for the purpose of issuing optionally redeemable convertible trust preferred securities 
the obligations of the business trusts to the holders of the trust preferred securities were all supported by convertible subordinated debentures issued by fleetwood to the respective business trusts 
in the first quarter of fiscal  the preferred securities of two of the trusts were either converted or redeemed  and the debentures cancelled 
under fin  which was adopted by the company as of january   the trust preferred securities continued to be presented as minority interests based on the fact that the company had the ability to call the trust preferred securities and that no single party held a majority of the preferred securities  therefore  the company was considered the primary beneficiary of the trusts 
under fin r  which was adopted by the company as of april   the call option embedded in the trust preferred securities was determined to be clearly and closely related to the underlying security 
fin r confirmed that the call option could no longer be separately evaluated as a determinant of the primary beneficiary of the trusts 
as a result  the business trusts were then deemed to have no primary beneficiary and they were deconsolidated  resulting in the presentation of the convertible subordinated debenture obligations to the underlying trusts as a long term liability for all years presented 
amounts previously shown in the statements of operations as minority interest in fleetwood capital trusts i  ii and iii  net of taxes  were reclassified for all periods presented to interest expense  with the related tax effect included in the tax provision

to qualify as a discontinued operation  sfas requires that the cash flow of the disposed component be eliminated from the operations of the ongoing entity and that the ongoing entity not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the disposed component after the disposal transaction

 accounting for asset retirement obligations  refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
fin requires a company to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
the fair value of a liability for the conditional asset retirement obligation should be recognized when incurred

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on marketable investments  investments underlying a company owned life insurance program coli  and variable rate debt under the secured credit facility 
in addition  market related changes to our convertible trust preferred securities indirectly may impact the amount of the deferred tax valuation allowance  which is currently dependent on available tax strategies  including the unrealized gains on these securities 
we do not currently use interest rate swaps  futures contracts or options on futures  or other types of derivative financial instruments 
the vast majority of our marketable investments are in institutional money market funds or fixed rate securities with average original maturity dates of two weeks or less  minimizing the effect of interest rate fluctuations on their fair value 
with respect to the company owned life insurance program  the underlying investments are subject to both interest rate risk and equity market risk 
for variable rate debt  changes in interest rates generally do not influence fair market value  but do affect future earnings and cash flows 
based upon the amount of variable rate debt outstanding at the end of the year  and holding the variable rate debt balance constant  each one percentage point increase in interest rates occurring on the first day of an annual period would result in an increase in interest expense of approximately  for both fixed rate loans and debt  changes in interest rates generally affect the fair market value  but not earnings or cash flows 
currently  the effects of such changes on the company s financial statements are not expected to be material 
we do not believe that future market equity or interest rate risks related to our marketable investments or debt obligations will have a material impact on our results
