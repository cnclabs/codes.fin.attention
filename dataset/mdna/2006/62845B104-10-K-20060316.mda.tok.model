item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction mutualfirst financial  inc  a maryland corporation  is a savings and loan holding company and its wholly owned subsidiary is mutual federal savings bank  muncie  indiana 
mfs financial  inc was formed in september to become the holding company of mutual federal in connection with mutual federal s conversion from the mutual to stock form of organization on december  in april  mfs financial  inc formally changed its corporate name to mutualfirst financial  inc mutualfirst 
the words we  our and us refer to mutualfirst and mutual federal on a consolidated basis  except that references to us prior to december  refer only to mutual federal 
on september   mutual federal purchased certain assets totaling million and assumed certain liabilities totaling million representing the operations of fidelity federal savings bank fidelity located in marion  indiana for million in cash 
the assets purchased included residential real estate mortgage loans of million  consumer loans of million  commercial and construction loans of million 
the liabilities assumed included total deposits of million including million core savings and transaction accounts and federal home loan bank advances of million 
our principal business consists of attracting retail deposits from the general public and investing those funds primarily in permanent loans secured by first mortgages on owner occupied  one to four family residences  a variety of consumer loans  loans secured by commercial and multi family real estate and commercial business loans 
we are headquartered in muncie  indiana with retail offices primarily serving delaware  randolph  kosciusko  and grant counties in indiana 
we also originate mortgage loans in contiguous counties  and we originate indirect consumer loans throughout indiana 
the following discussion is intended to assist your understanding of our financial condition and results of operations 
the information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements 
our results of operations depend primarily on the level of our net interest income  which is the difference between interest income on interest earning assets  such as loans  mortgage backed securities and investment securities  and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities  primarily deposits and borrowings 
the structure of our interest earning assets versus the structure of interest bearing liabilities along with the shape of the yield curve has a direct impact 
next page on our net interest income 
historically  our interest earning assets have been longer term in nature ie  fixed rate mortgage loans and interest bearing liabilities have been shorter term ie  certificates of deposit  regular savings accounts  etc this structure would impact net interest income favorably in a decreasing rate environment  assuming a normally shaped yield curve  as the rates on interest bearing liabilities would decrease more rapidly than rates on the interest earning assets 
conversely  in an increasing rate environment  assuming a normally shaped yield curve  net interest income would be impacted unfavorably as rates on interest earning assets would increase at a slower rate than rates on interest bearing liabilities 
since it has been mutualfirst s strategic objective to change the repricing structure of its interest earning assets from longer term to shorter term to better match the structure of our interest bearing liabilities and therefore reduce the impact interest rate changes have on our net interest income 
strategies employed to accomplish this objective have been to increase the originations of variable rate commercial loans and shorter term consumer loans and to sell longer term mortgage loans 
during  in keeping with its strategic objective to reduce interest rate risk exposure  mutualfirst also sold million of long term fixed rate loans that had been held for sale  which reduced potential earning assets and therefore had a negative impact on net interest income 
this was offset  in the short term  by recognizing a gain on the sale of these loans of  during the year 
recent increases in short term interest rates  as a result of increases in the federal funds rate by the board of governors of the federal reserve system  without a corresponding increase in long term interest rates have resulted in an increase in interest expense and a reduction in net interest income in the effect of the flattening yield curve is to increase our cost of funds at a faster rate than our yield on loans and investments  due to the longer term nature of our interest earning assets 
in  as we increase our investment in business related loans  which are considered to entail greater risks than one to four family residential loans  in order to help offset the pressure on our net interest margin  our provision for loan losses has increased to reflect this increased risk 
our results of operations also are affected by the level of our non interest income and expenses and income tax expense 
results of operations also depend upon the level of mutualfirst s non interest income  including fee income and service charges  and the level of its non interest expense  including general and administrative expenses 
in addition to the fidelity acquisition  we are expanding through the addition of a new branch office located in syracuse  indiana in kosciusko county  which opened in june we have purchased land in elkhart county  in northern indiana  for the purpose of building a new branch office in that vibrant market in we also have developed a new investment management and private banking division in order to better service clients with more specialized financial needs 
the intent of all these initiatives is to increase income over the long term 
however  on a short term basis  expenses relating to the new branches and new division will have the affect of increasing non interest expense with no immediate offsetting income 
the purchase of fidelity referred to above was accretive to income in the fourth quarter due to substantial cost savings 

next page management strategy our strategy is to operate as an independent  retail oriented financial institution dedicated to serving customers in our market areas 
our commitment is to provide a broad range of products and services to meet the needs of our customers 
as part of this commitment  we are looking to increase our emphasis on commercial business products and services 
we also operate a fully interactive transactional website 
in addition  we are continually looking at cost effective ways to expand our market area 
financial highlights of our strategy include continuing as a diversified lender 
we have been successful in diversifying our loan portfolio to reduce our reliance on any one type of loan 
from through approximately of our loan portfolio consisted of loans other than one to four family real estate loans 
since that time to the end of  that percentage has increased to continuing as a leading one to four family lender 
we are one of the largest originators of one to four family residential loans in our four county market area 
during  we originated million of one to four family residential loans 
continuing to focus on asset quality 
non performing assets to total assets was at december   up from 
at december  we believe this increase is temporary and the trend is mitigated because a significant portion of the increase is due to a million loan on which management expects to incur no loss due to collateral value 
we are confident that our underwriting standards will continue to provide for a quality loan portfolio 
continuing our strong capital position 
as a result of our consistent profitability  we have historically maintained a strong capital position 
at december   our ratio of stockholders equity to total assets was 

next page financial condition at december  compared to december  general 
our assets increased million during  ending the year at million compared to million at december   primarily due to the acquisition of the assets from fidelity 
liabilities increased million or primarily due to the assumption of deposits and borrowings of fidelity 
stockholders equity increased to million at december   when compared to december   as net income  employee benefits earned and stock options exercised of million were partially offset by stock repurchases and dividends of million 
loans 
our net loan portfolio increased million from million at december   to million at december  primarily because of the fidelity acquisition 
consumer loans increased million or from million at december  to million at december  most of the consumer loan growth came from home equity and home improvements loans  which increased million or from million to million and recreational vehicle loans  which increased million or from million to million 
commercial business loans increased million or from million to million at december  it has been our strategy to increase non real estate mortgage loans as a percentage of our loan portfolio in order to mitigate interest rate risk and enhance the portfolio yield 
accordingly  we sold million of our fixed rate one to four family mortgage loans in real estate mortgage loans increased million or from million to million at december  mortgage loans held for sale decreased  allowance for loan loss 
the allowance for loan losses increased million to million at december  this increase included additional reserves of million acquired with the fidelity purchase and assumption 
net charge offs for the year were million or 
of average loans compared to million or 
of average loans in the increase in the allowance for loan losses is due to continued poor economic conditions in some of our markets and increases in loan balances 
in addition  the bank charged off a  commercial business loan to a distribution center that failed and the collateral accounts receivable have proven to be uncollectible 
the bank also charged off  of a debt extended to a construction company that failed 
the bank is pursuing collection of this debt through litigation 
the amount and potential likelihood of recovery is unknown at this time 
as of december  allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans receivable and non performing loans was 
and  respectively 
securities 
investment securities totaled million at december  compared to million at december   a increase 
this small increase was primarily due to our loan growth outpacing our deposit growth during the year 
our overall liquidity decreased during the year due to the flatness of the yield curve and the resultant lack of profitable investment opportunities compared to funding costs 
liabilities 
our total liabilities increased million or to million at december  from million at december  this increase was due primarily 
next page to the assumption of substantially all of fidelity s liabilities

net income for the year ended december  increased  or to million compared to million for the year ended december  diluted earnings per share increased from in to in primarily due to one time expenses in associated with a separation agreement 
the company s earnings for would have been million for diluted earnings per share without the one time expenses 
the primary reasons for the decline  when comparing net income for to normalized  was a decreasing interest margin due to a flat yield curve and increased operating expenses due to costs related to current and future growth of the company 

next page net interest income 
net interest income increased  for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the primary reason for the improvement was a million  or increase in average interest earning assets  primarily due to the fidelity purchase  partially offset by a basis point decrease in the net interest margin reflecting the bank s liability sensitive nature  as short term interest rates rose 
interest income 
the increase in interest income during the year ended december   was due to an increase in the average yield on our earning assets from in to in as a result of increasing market interest rates 
this increase was enhanced by a million increase in average earning assets from million during to million during the majority of this increase was in average loans receivable due to the fidelity acquisition  which increased million from million in to million in the average yield on these loans increased basis points from in to in interest expense 
the increase in interest expense was due to an increase in interest rates and an increase in average interest bearing liabilities during the year 
there was a basis point increase in the cost of our average interest bearing liabilities from in to in as a result of higher market interest rates and an increase of million in average interest bearing liabilities from million in to million in as a result of the assumption of deposits and borrowings of fidelity 
the majority of this increase was in average deposits  which increased million from million in to million in the average cost on these deposits increased basis points from in to in provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses for was million  compared to million for due to the increased loan balances  higher net charge offs in compared to and higher non performing loans at the end of the year compared to a year ago 
non performing loans to total loans at december  were

at december  non performing assets to total assets were at december  compared to 
at december  these increases were primarily due to a million residential real estate loan secured by a first mortgage being over days past due 
management is confident that the collateral is more than enough to cover the debt 
also  a  commercial real estate loan that was performing as of the end of the third quarter defaulted in october and the collateral was taken into reo in december 
in addition  several troubled residential real estate loans totaling  were taken into reo in the fourth quarter 
only one of these loans  totaling  was related to the fidelity purchase 
potential losses on these properties are yet to be determined 
other income 
for the year ended december   non interest income increased  or to million compared to million for the increase was due primarily to an  or increase in service fee income due primarily to more checking accounts  the overdraft privilege program and a  or increase in commission income due to increased annuity sales 
these increases were partially offset by a  reduction in the gain on sale of loans due to reduced mortgage refinancing activity in and a 
next page  reduction in other income due primarily to reduced gain on the sale of real estate owned 
other expense 
non interest expense increased million or to million for the year ended december   compared to million excluding the million one time expense for the increase was due primarily to increased salaries and employee benefits costs and increased occupancy and equipment expenses that were up due to costs related to the purchase of fidelity in september and a new office opening in june in syracuse  indiana 
also  we relocated our corporate and investment management and private banking staffs to a recently purchased office building located next to our main office in muncie 
data processing fees increased  due to the purchase of fidelity  the addition of the new offices and the expiration of several contractual credits from our service provider received in and not in professional fees increased due to increases in legal and accounting services primarily related to regulatory compliance requirements and increased consulting fees related to the overdraft protection program 
a portion of these fees are one time in nature 
other expenses increased due to costs related to reo and other general and administrative expense increases related to the fidelity purchase 
the board of directors acted to accelerate the vesting of all outstanding options to december  in accordance with fasr 
as a result  there will be no expense associated with these options in future years 
income tax expense 
income tax expense increased  for the year ended december  compared to due to more taxable income 
the effective tax rate increased from to due to a decreased percentage of low income housing tax credits to taxable income when comparing to comparison of results of operations for years ended december  and general 
net income for the year ended december  decreased million or to million compared to million for the year ended december  diluted earnings per share decreased from in to in primarily due to one time expenses associated with a separation agreement entered into in november with the company s former senior vice president and director 
the company s earnings for the year would have been million for diluted earnings per share without the one time expenses 
net interest income 
interest income decreased million  or to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  interest expense decreased million  or from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  as a result  net interest income decreased  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  due to a lower net interest margin and a lower volume of net earning assets 
the net interest margin decreased from for the year ended december   to for the year ended december  as yields on interest earning assets decreased at a more rapid rate than the decrease in the cost of interest bearing liabilities 

next page interest income 
the decrease in interest income during the year ended december  was due to a reduction in the average yield on our earning assets from in to in as a result of lower market interest rates and payoffs of older higher rate loans 
this decrease was partially offset by a million increase in average earning assets from million during to million during the majority of this increase was in average loans receivable  which increased million from in to million in the average yield on these loans decreased basis points from in to in interest expense 
the decrease in interest expense was due to a basis point reduction in the cost of our average interest bearing liabilities from in to in as a result of lower market interest rates 
this decrease was partially offset by a million increase in average interest bearing liabilities from million in to million in the majority of this increase was in average deposits  which increased million from million in to million in the average cost on these deposits decreased basis points from in to in provision for loan losses 
for the year ended december   the provision for loan losses amounted to million compared to million in in each period  the provision for loan losses was based on an analysis of individual loans  prior and current year loss experience  overall growth in the portfolio  the change in the portfolio mix and current economic conditions in our markets 
we continue to experience poor  while improving  economic conditions in some of our markets and continue to change our portfolio mix to more non mortgage related loans 
however  the overriding reasons for the increase in the provision for loan losses in compared to were an increase in non performing loans and larger than anticipated charge offs during the year 
other income 
other income for the year ended december  increased slightly to million from million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to a  increase in service fee and commission income due to new checking account overdraft services and an addition to the non traditional financial services sales force 
also  the limited partnerships experienced a gain of  in compared to a  loss in due to increased occupancy rates 
these changes were partially offset by a decrease in loan sale gains of  due to fewer mortgage originations in when compared to the refinance activity in also  there was a smaller increase in cash surrender value of life insurance of  in when compared to due the collection of life insurance proceeds upon the death of a former director in  with no similar event occurring in other expense 
total operating expenses increased million or from million for the year ended december  to million for salaries and employee benefits were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the period  an increase of million or 
the primary reason for the increase was the one time million expense associated with the separation agreement announced in november 
also adding to operating expenses for was a more aggressive marketing effort to promote loans and short term core deposits and the opening of our eighteenth branch office in warsaw 
the costs associated with the separation agreement mentioned above and compliance 
next page issues related to the sarbanes oxley legislation increased professional fees  or in when compared to atm expenses were up  or due primarily to new card issuances that take place approximately every other year and the addition of an atm at the new branch location 
other expenses increased  due to increased postage  telephone  and other expenses primarily related to the new branch opening and regulatory compliance costs

liquidity and commitments mutual federal is required to maintain adequate levels of investments for liquidity purposes to ensure the institution s safe and sound operations 
liquidity may increase or decrease depending upon the availability of funds and comparative yields on investments in relation to the return on loans 
historically  we have maintained liquid assets at levels adequate to meet the requirements of normal operations  including potential deposit outflows 
cash flow projections are regularly reviewed and updated to ensure that adequate liquidity is maintained 
at december   our liquidity ratio  which is our liquid assets as a percentage of net withdrawable savings deposits and current borrowings  was 
our liquidity  represented by cash and cash equivalents and investment securities  is a product of our operating  investing and financing activities 
our primary sources of funds are deposits  amortization  prepayments and maturities of outstanding loans and mortgage backed securities  maturities of investment securities and other short term investments and funds provided from operations 
while scheduled payments from the amortization of loans and mortgage backed securities and maturing investment securities and short term investments are relatively predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
in addition  we invest excess funds in short term interest earning assets  which provide liquidity to meet lending requirements 
we also generate cash through borrowings 
we utilize federal home loan bank advances to leverage our capital base and provide funds for our lending and investment activities  and to enhance out interest rate risk management 
liquidity management is both a daily and long term function of business management 
excess liquidity is generally invested in short term investments such as overnight deposits or us agency securities 
we use our sources of funds primarily to meet our ongoing commitments  to pay maturing certificates of deposit and savings withdrawals  to fund loan commitments and to maintain our portfolio of mortgage backed securities and investment securities 
at december   the total approved loan origination commitments outstanding amounted to million 
at the same date  the unadvanced portion of construction loans was million 
at december   unused lines of credit totaled million and outstanding letters of credit totaled million 
as of december   certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in one year or less totaled million  and investment and mortgage backed securities scheduled to mature in one year or less totaled million 
based on historical experience  management believes that a 
next page significant portion of maturing deposits will remain with us 
we anticipate that we will continue to have sufficient funds  through deposits and borrowings  to meet our current commitments

pending accounting pronouncements shared based payment 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 revised  share based payment sfas r  which requires all public companies to record compensation cost for stock options and other awards provided to employees in return for employee service 
the cost of the options is measured at the fair value of the options when granted and is expensed over the employee service period  which is normally the vesting period of the options granted 
the company adopted sfas r on january  future compensation cost and the impact on the company s results of operation as a result of any future option grants will depend on the level of any future option grants  the related vesting period  and the calculation of the fair value of the options granted as of the grant date 
as such  the company cannot currently estimate compensation expense relating to future awards 
the adoption of sfas no 
r is not expected to have a significant impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
in january  the emerging issues task force eitf began a project to provide additional guidance on when a market value decline on debt and marketable equity securities should be considered other than temporary 
currently  declines in market value that are considered to be other than temporary require that a loss be recognized through the income statement 
in march  the fasb ratified the consensus reached by the eitf in issue  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
next page eitf 
eitf provides guidance for determining when an investment is considered impaired  whether impairment is other than temporary  and measurement of an impairment loss 
in september  the fasb issued a staff position fsp which delayed the effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance of eitf due to additional proposed guidance 
in june  the fasb decided not to provide additional guidance on the meaning of other than temporary impairment  but directed the fasb staff to issue a fasb staff position fsp titled fsp  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
the final fsp supersedes eitf and eitf topic no 
d  recognition of other than temporary impairment upon the planned sale of a security whose cost exceeds fair value 
fsp fas replaces guidance in eitf on loss recognition with references to existing other than temporary impairment guidance  such as fasb statement no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas no 

fsp fas also clarifies that an investor should recognize an impairment loss no later than when the impairment is deemed other than temporary  even if a decision to sell has not been made 
fsp fas was effective for other than temporary impairment analysis conducted in periods beginning after september  the company has consistently followed the loss recognition guidance in sfas no 
 so the adoption of fsp fas did not have a significant impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
earnings per share 
on september   the fasb issued a proposed amendment to sfas no 
 earnings per share  to clarify guidance for mandatorily convertible instruments  the treasury stock method  contingently issuable shares  and contracts that may be settled in cash or shares 
the primary impact on the company of the proposed statement would be a change to the treasury stock method for year to date diluted earnings per share 
critical accounting policies the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k contain a summary of mutualfirst s significant accounting policies 
certain of these policies are important to the portrayal of mutualfirst s financial condition  since they require management to make difficult  complex or subjective judgments  some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain 
management believes that its critical accounting policies include determining the allowance for loan losses  the valuation of foreclosed assets  mortgage servicing rights and real estate held for development and the valuation of intangible assets 
the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is based on estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant changes in the economic environment and market conditions 
a worsening or protracted economic decline would increase the likelihood of additional losses due to credit and market risk and could create the need for additional loss reserves 

next page allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is a significant estimate that can and does change based on management s assumptions about specific borrowers and current general economic and business conditions  among other factors 
management reviews the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on at least a quarterly basis 
the evaluation by management includes consideration of past loss experience  changes in the composition of the loan portfolio  the current condition and amount of loans outstanding  identified problem loans and the probability of collecting all amounts due 
foreclosed assets foreclosed assets are carried at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated selling costs 
management estimates the fair value of the properties based on current appraisal information 
fair value estimates are particularly susceptible to significant changes in the economic environment  market conditions  and real estate market 
a worsening or protracted economic decline would increase the likelihood of a decline in property values and could create the need to write down the properties through current operations 
mortgage servicing rights mortgage servicing rights msrs associated with loans originated and sold  where servicing is retained  are capitalized and included in other intangible assets in the consolidated balance sheet 
the value of the capitalized servicing rights represents the present value of the future servicing fees arising from the right to service loans in the portfolio 
critical accounting policies for msrs relate to the initial valuation and subsequent impairment tests 
the methodology used to determine the valuation of msrs requires the development and use of a number of estimates  including anticipated principal amortization and prepayments of that principal balance 
events that may significantly affect the estimates used are changes in interest rates  mortgage loan prepayment speeds and the payment performance of the underlying loans 
the carrying value of the msrs is periodically reviewed for impairment based on a determination of fair value 
for purposes of measuring impairment  the servicing rights are compared to a valuation prepared based on a discounted cash flow methodology  utilizing current prepayment speeds and discount rates 
impairment  if any  is recognized through a valuation allowance and is recorded as amortization of intangible assets 
intangible assets mutualfirst periodically assesses the impairment of its goodwill and the recoverability of its core deposit intangible 
impairment is the condition that exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
if actual external conditions and future operating results differ from mutualfirst s judgments  impairment and or increased amortization charges may be necessary to reduce the carrying value of these assets to the appropriate value 

next page impact of inflation our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the principles require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars  without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
our primary assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates affect our performance more than general levels of inflation 
interest rates  however  do not necessarily move in the same direction or with the same magnitude as the price of goods and services  since such prices are affected by inflation 
in a period of rapidly rising interest rates  the liquidity and maturity structure of our assets and liabilities are critical to the maintenance of acceptance performance levels 
the principal effect of inflation  as distinct from levels of interest rates  on earnings is in the area of non interest expense 
expense items such as employee compensation  employee benefits and occupancy and equipment cost may increase because of inflation 
inflation also may increase the dollar value of the collateral securing loans that we have made 
we are unable to determine the extent to which properties securing our loans have appreciated in dollar value due to inflation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk asset and liability management and market risk our risk when interest rates change 
the rates of interest we earn on assets and pay on liabilities generally is established contractually for a period of time 
market interest rates change over time 
accordingly  our results of operations  like those of other financial institutions  are impacted by changes in interest rates and the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities 
the risk associated with changes in interest rates and our ability to adapt to these changes is known as interest rate risk and is our most significant market risk 
how we measure our risk of interest rate changes 
as part of our attempt to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates and comply with applicable regulations  we monitor our interest rate risk 
in monitoring interest rate risk  we continually analyze and manage assets and liabilities based on their payment streams and interest rates  the timing of their maturities  and their sensitivity to actual or potential changes in market interest rates 
in order to minimize the potential for adverse effects of material and prolonged changes in interest rates on our results of operations  we adopted asset and liability management policies to better match the maturities and repricing terms of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
mutual federal s board of directors sets and recommends asset and liability policies  which are implemented by the asset and liability management committee 
the asset and liability management committee is chaired by the chief financial officer and is comprised of members of our senior management 
the purpose of the asset and liability management committee is to communicate  coordinate and control asset liability management issues consistent 
next page with our business plan and board approved policies 
this committee establishes and monitors the volume and mix of assets and funding sources taking into account relative costs and spreads  interest rate sensitivity and liquidity needs 
the objectives are to manage assets and funding sources consistent with liquidity  capital adequacy  growth  risk and profitability goals 
the asset and liability management committee generally meets monthly to review  among other things  economic conditions and interest rate outlook  current and projected liquidity needs and capital position  anticipated changes in the volume and mix of assets and liabilities and interest rate risk exposure limits versus current projections pursuant to a net present value of portfolio equity analysis and income simulations 
at each meeting  the asset and liability management committee recommends appropriate strategy changes based on this review 
the chief financial officer is responsible for reviewing and reporting on the effects of the policy implementations and strategies to the board of directors  at least quarterly 
in order to manage our assets and liabilities and achieve the desired liquidity  credit quality  interest rate risk  profitability and capital targets  we have sought to originate and purchase adjustable rate mortgage loans and commercial business loans  originate shorter term consumer loans  manage our deposits to establish stable deposit relationships  acquire longer term borrowings at fixed rates  when appropriate  to offset the negative impact of longer term fixed rate loans in our loan portfolio  and limit the percentage of long term fixed rate loans in our portfolio 
depending on the level of general interest rates  the relationship between long and short term interest rates  market conditions and competitive factors  the asset and liability management committee may increase our interest rate risk position somewhat in order to maintain our net interest margin 
we intend to increase our emphasis on the origination of relatively short term and or adjustable rate loans 
in addition  in an effort to avoid an increase in the percentage of long term fixed rate loans in our portfolio  in  we sold million of fixed rate  one to four family mortgage loans with a term to maturity of over years in the secondary market 
the asset and liability management committee regularly reviews interest rate risk by forecasting the impact of alternative interest rate environments on net interest income and market value of portfolio equity  which is defined as the net present value of an institution s existing assets  liabilities and off balance sheet instruments  and evaluating such impacts against the maximum potential changes in net interest income and market value of portfolio equity that are authorized by our board of directors 
the office of thrift supervision provides mutual federal with the information presented in the following tables 
the tables present the change in our net portfolio value at december  and that would occur upon an immediate and sustained change in market interest rates of to basis points as required by the office of thrift supervision  and do not give any

the office of thrift supervision uses certain assumptions in assessing the interest rate risk of savings banks 
these assumptions relate to interest rates  loan prepayment rates  deposit decay rates  and the market value of certain assets under differing interest rate scenarios  among others 
as with any method of measuring interest rate risk  certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing tables 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate mortgage loans  have features which restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
further  if interest rates change  expected rates of prepayments on loans and early withdrawals from certificates could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the tables
