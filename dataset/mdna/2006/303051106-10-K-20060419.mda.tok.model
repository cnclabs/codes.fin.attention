risk factors before you invest in our securities  you should be aware that there are various risks  including those described below 
you should consider carefully these risk factors together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this report before you decide your actions with respect to our securities 
the following risk factors could adversely affect our revenue  expenses  net income  cash flow  ability to service our indebtedness  and ability to make distributions to our shareholders  any of which could adversely affect the trading price of our publicly traded securities 

table of contents intense competition in our industry could prevent us from increasing or sustaining our revenues and prevent us from achieving or sustaining profitability 
the greeting card  party supply and special occasion retailing business is highly competitive 
increased competition by existing or future competitors may reduce our sales and cause us to incur another loss 
as a result of competition from other specialty party supplies and paper goods retailers  we may need to incur additional marketing and promotional expenses to achieve sales growth in our existing stores 
our stores compete with a variety of smaller and larger retailers  including specialty party supplies and paper goods retailers  including other party superstores  card shops and designated departments in mass merchandisers  warehouse merchandise clubs and discount general merchandise chains  toy stores  drug stores  supermarkets  dollar stores  department stores of local  regional and national chains  and internet retailers 
many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and personnel resources than we do 
we may encounter additional competition from new entrants in the future in our existing markets 
our competitors may be able to respond more quickly or adjust prices more effectively to take advantage of new opportunities or customer requirements 
increased competition could result in pricing pressures  reduced sales  reduced margins or failure to achieve or maintain widespread market acceptance  any of which could prevent us from increasing or sustaining our revenues and achieving or sustaining profitability 
customers requirements are likely to evolve  and we will not retain customers or attract new customers if we do not anticipate and meet specific customer requirements and changes in merchandising trends 
our core operations rely on a stable customer base 
failure to maintain existing customers and obtain new customers may adversely affect our market position 
our success depends  in part  on our ability to anticipate and respond to changing merchandise trends and consumer demands in a timely manner 
accordingly  any delay or failure by us in identifying and responding to emerging trends could adversely affect consumer acceptance of the merchandise in our stores 
if we are required to sell a significant amount of unsold inventory at below average mark ups over our cost or below cost  such action could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we make merchandising decisions well in advance of the seasons during which we will sell the merchandise 
as a result  if we fail to identify and respond quickly to emerging trends  consumer acceptance of the merchandise in our stores could diminish and we may experience a reduction in revenues 
we sell certain licensed products that are in great demand for short time periods  making it difficult to project our inventory needs for these products 
significantly greater or less than projected product demand could lead to one or more of the following lost sales due to insufficient inventory  higher carrying costs associated with slower turning inventory  and reduced or eliminated margins due to mark downs on excess inventory 

table of contents if consumer demand for single use  disposable party goods were to diminish  the party supplies and paper goods industry and our revenues would be negatively affected 
for example  if cost increases in raw materials such as paper  plastic  cardboard or petroleum were to cause our prices to increase significantly  consumers might decide to forgo the convenience associated with single use  disposable products 
similarly  changes in consumer preferences away from disposable products and in favor of reusable products for environmental or other reasons could reduce the demand for our products 
a downturn in the economy may affect consumer purchases of discretionary items  which could reduce our sales 
in general  our sales represent discretionary spending by our customers 
discretionary spending is affected by many factors  including  among others  general business conditions  interest rates  the availability of consumer credit  taxation and consumer confidence in future economic conditions 
our customers purchases of discretionary items  including our products  could decline during periods when disposable income is lower or during periods of actual or perceived unfavorable economic conditions 
if this occurs  our revenues and profitability will decline 
in addition  our sales could be adversely affected by a continued downturn in the economic conditions of the markets in which we operate 
our business depends on continued good relations with our suppliers 
our failure to maintain good relationships with our principal suppliers or the loss of our principal suppliers would hurt our business 
we purchase our inventory from more than vendors world wide  with the largest supplier representing approximately and the ten largest suppliers representing approximately of our aggregate purchases in fiscal many of our principal suppliers currently provide us with incentives like volume purchasing allowances and trade discounts 
if our suppliers were to reduce or discontinue these incentives  prices from our suppliers would increase and our profitability would be reduced 
as is customary in our industry  we generally do not have long term contracts with any suppliers and any supplier could discontinue selling to us at any time 
if a vendor becomes unable or unwilling to ship goods or provide favorable terms  this then could adversely affect our ability to compete and our financial performance 
our arrangements with overseas suppliers are subject to risks of doing business abroad  such as import duties  trade restrictions  work stoppages  political instability and other factors which could have an adverse effect on our business 
on february   we entered into a definitive agreement with the premier greetings division of paramount cards inc under the terms of the agreement  paramount supplies substantially all of our greeting cards 
as a result of this agreement  we have become more dependent on one supplier for providing greeting cards to our stores 
the failure of paramount to adequately satisfy the needs of our customers or to meet our greeting card volume requirements could have an adverse effect on our business 
on january   we entered into a definitive agreement with amscan holdings  inc the agreement makes amscan the company s exclusive supplier of solid color paper tableware products 
amscan has previously supplied party merchandise to the company prior to the date of this agreement 
in conjunction with the agreement  amscan ships merchandise to the naperville distribution center  and the ownership of merchandise transfers to us only after the goods are shipped out of the distribution center 
the failure of amscan to provide product that adequately satisfies the needs of our customers or to meet our volume requirements could have an adverse effect on our business 
we face new competitive threats as a result of amscan s acquisition of party city corporation 
in december  our largest supplier amscan holdings  inc reported that it had completed the acquisition of party city corporation a direct competitor 
party city corporation operates approximately stores nationwide many of which are in markets where we compete 
amscan s status as our largest supplier  and the largest supplier in our industry could adversely affect our ability to compete favorably or operate successfully in a changed marketplace 
price pressures from such new sources of competition  particularly in the event of a strain in our relationship with amscan  could erode our margins and cause our financial results to suffer 

table of contents we may need to raise additional capital to fund our operations and support our long term growth strategy 
our ability to make scheduled payments of principal of  or to pay the interest on  or to refinance  indebtedness or to fund planned capital expenditures  will depend upon our future performance  which  in turn  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive and other factors that are beyond our control 
there can be no assurance that our business will continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures after satisfying certain liabilities arising in the ordinary course of business 
if unable to do so  we may be required to refinance all or a portion of our existing debt  sell assets or obtain additional financing 
there can be no assurance that any refinancing would be available or available on favorable terms or that any sales of assets or additional financing could be obtained or obtained on favorable terms 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  we may be unable to develop or enhance our products and services  implement our long term growth strategy  take advantage of future opportunities or respond in a timely manner to competitive pressures 
we are substantially leveraged and our financing facility contains covenants that could adversely affect our business 
our indebtedness restricts our ability to obtain additional financing in the future  and because we may be more leveraged than some of our competitors  may place us at a competitive disadvantage 
these restrictions could adversely affect our ability to finance future operations  potential acquisitions or capital needs or to engage in other business activities that may be in our best interest 
also  our financing facility contains covenants that impose operating and financial restrictions on us and require us to maintain a minimum borrowing base availability or to meet certain financial tests 
our ability to continue to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control 
the breach of any of these covenants would result in a default under our indebtedness  in which case our lender could elect to declare all amounts borrowed thereunder  together with accrued interest  to be due and payable  foreclosure on the assets servicing the debt or cease to provide additional revolving loans or letters of credit which would have a material adverse effect on our business 
the seasonal nature of our business could adversely impact our operations 
our business is highly seasonal  with operating results varying from quarter to quarter 
we have historically experienced higher sales during the second and fourth quarters primarily due to increased demand by customers for our products attributable to special occasions and holiday seasons during these periods 
lower sales than expected by us during these periods  a lack of availability of product  or a general economic downturn in sales could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations for the full year 
in addition  the timing of new store openings  related pre opening expenses and the amount of revenue contributed by new and existing stores may cause our quarterly results of operations to fluctuate 
we may not be able to profitably grow our business 
in order to profitably grow our business  we need to increase sales in our existing markets and open additional stores 
opening additional stores in existing markets could reduce sales from our stores located in or near those markets and stores opened in new markets may not be profitable 
in addition  the opening of new stores could put additional strain on our existing infrastructure and may limit our ability to effectively leverage the costs of the new stores 
we may not be able to effectively execute our long term growth strategy 
our long term growth strategy requires effective planning and management 
once a new geographic market is identified  we must obtain suitable store sites on acceptable terms 
also  the competitive and merchandising challenges we face in new geographic markets may be different from the challenges we face in our existing geographic markets 
we may have to adapt to regional tastes and customs and compete against established and 
table of contents familiar local businesses with innovative or unique techniques for marketing party supplies and paper goods 
entering new markets may also place significant demands on our management  financial controls  operations and information systems 
this may cause us to incur higher costs relating to marketing and operations 
expansion will require an increase in our personnel  particularly store managers and sales associates  to operate our new stores 
if we decide to change the location of the headquarters and distribution center when the lease expires at february  we may experience distractions that could negatively impact operations 
the lease for the naperville  illinois distribution center and headquarters expires february while we do have renewal options for an additional five years  if we decide to relocate the facilities we could experience significant distractions from the management of the business as well as interruptions that could severely impair operations 
due to relocating the distribution center  we could experience some interruption or slow down in our ability to replenish our stores 
as well  the relocation of our management information systems could result in downtime that would impede our operations and potentially cause problems or delays with our financial reporting 
relocating the headquarters might also result in the loss of employees who are unwilling to travel the extra distance which could stress the existing management team 
if we do not comply with the numerous laws and regulations that govern our business  our business could be harmed 
each of our stores must comply with regulations adopted by federal agencies and with licensing and other regulations enforced by state and local health  sanitation  safety  fire and other departments 
more stringent and varied requirements of local governmental bodies with respect to zoning  land use and environmental factors  and difficulties or failures in obtaining the required licenses or approvals  can delay and sometimes prevent the opening of a new store 
in addition  we comply with the fair labor standards act and various state laws governing various matters such as minimum wage  overtime and other working conditions 
we also comply with the provisions of the americans with disabilities act of  as amended  which requires generally that employers provide reasonable accommodation for employees with disabilities and that stores be accessible to customers with disabilities 
however  future violations of such laws  the enactment of stricter laws or regulations or the implementation of more aggressive enforcement policies could adversely affect our operations or financial condition 
if we are unable to hire additional qualified personnel or retain existing personnel  we may not be able to operate our business successfully 
our success depends upon the efforts of our senior management and other key personnel 
the loss of the services of any member of our management team or a key employee  or a failure to timely retain a replacement officer could have a material adverse effect on us 
our future success will also depend in part on attracting and retaining quality employees 
many of our employees are in entry level or part time positions with historically high rates of turnover 
our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling costs is subject to external factors  such as unemployment levels  minimum wage legislation and changing demographics 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in retaining our existing key personnel or in attracting and retaining additional employees we may require 
any difficulties in obtaining  retaining and training qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on us 
higher administrative expenses could adversely affect our business and operations 
higher selling  general and administrative expenses occasioned by the potential need for additional advertising  marketing  administrative or management information systems expenditures could negatively impact our business and operations 

table of contents interruption or obsolescence of our management information systems could have a negative effect on our competitive ability and our business generally 
we believe that our management information systems are an important factor in supporting our business and enhancing our competitive position in the industry 
over the past three years  we have invested significant resources in systems and infrastructure to support our business and make it more efficient 
we use a management information and control system  which is based on the jda merchandise management system software package jda and supports the complete range of retail cycle functions in the areas of finance  merchandising and distribution 
all stores are linked to our headquarters through personal computers  which interface with an ibm as and provide auto replenishment of inventory and the ability to enter payroll information and send and receive electronic mail 
these personal computers are also tied into our point of sale system pos system 
the pos system provides sales information to our stores and central office and is used to enhance merchandise planning and buying programs 
in the second half of fiscal  we integrated jda s portfolio advanced replenishment by e suite and jda s seasonal profiling by intellect into our existing jda merchandise management system installation 
this highly regarded retail system provides sophisticated demand forecasting and functionalities such as seasonal profiling  exception management and promotional sales planning that will enable us to optimize store replenishment while reducing overall inventory 
any obsolescence or continuing interruption in the functioning of these systems could have a negative effect on our ability to compete effectively in the industry and on our business 
our warrants and stock options may have significant dilutive effects on holders of common stock generally 
pursuant to our bankruptcy plan of reorganization  we issued four series of warrants to holders of our old pre bankruptcy common stock to purchase up to approximately subject to certain dilution events of the common stock issued under the bankruptcy plan assuming exercise of all such warrants 
these four series of warrants are exercisable for terms ranging from four to eight years from the issuance date 
we currently have stock option plans pursuant to which we have the authority to issue options to our employees and directors for up to  shares of our common stock 
as of january   there were options issued to purchase  shares of our common stock outstanding with a weighted average exercise price of per share 
the issuance of shares of common stock pursuant to the exercise of the four series of warrants  the exercise of stock options  and the anti dilution rights protection of the warrants issued to management could significantly dilute the holders of common stock currently issued and outstanding 
certain provisions of our charter may prevent or delay a change of control of the company 
our certificate of incorporation provides for a classified board of directors 
any effort to obtain control of our board of directors by causing the election of a majority of the board of directors may require more time than would be required without a staggered election structure 
our certificate of incorporation also imposes restrictions on the direct or indirect transferability of our common stock  subject to certain exceptions  such that no person or certain groups of persons x may acquire or accumulate five percent or more as determined under tax law principles governing the application of section of the internal revenue code of  as amended of the common stock or y who  upon implementation of the plan  owns or more of the common stock  may acquire additional common stock 
these provisions would have the effect of preventing a change of control for the duration of such restrictions 
during fiscal  permission to exceed the threshold was requested by and granted to three independent parties 
adverse publicity could adversely affect our business 
we generally operate in medium sized towns and suburban neighborhoods 
adverse publicity or news coverage relating to us could negatively impact our efforts to establish and promote name recognition and a positive image 

table of contents our stock price may be volatile and could decline 
our common stock has had limited trading activity 
we cannot predict the extent to which investor interest in our stock will lead to the development of a more active trading market  how liquid that market might become or whether it will be sustained 
the trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations due to the factors discussed in this risk factors section and elsewhere in this document  including our operating results failing to meet the expectations of our investors  material announcements by us or our competitors  governmental regulatory action  or adverse changes in general market conditions or economic trends 
in addition  the stock markets in general have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
these broad market and industry factors may decrease the market price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance 
we do not anticipate paying dividends 
we have not paid dividends on our common stock and we do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future 
we intend to retain future earnings  if any  to finance the expansion of our operations and for general corporate purposes  including future acquisitions 
in addition  our financing facility prohibits us from paying dividends on our capital stock

item properties the initial term of our store leases are typically years and generally allow us to renew for up to two additional five year terms 
the terms of the majority of the leases  including renewal terms  extend beyond year in addition to our stores  all of which are leased  we also lease a distribution center in naperville  illinois  with the initial lease term expiring in february we have the option to renew the initial term of the lease for an additional period of years 
this facility consists of a three story office building and  square foot distribution center that sits on acres of land 
item legal proceedings we are from time to time named in charges filed with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc and other federal and state governmental entities governing employees and the workplace 
in one of these matters  the eeoc issued a determination on february  that there is reasonable cause to believe that certain employees were subject to verbal harassment in violation of applicable laws 
a determination that we were not in compliance with the rules and regulations of these governmental entities could result in the award of damages and or equitable remedies 
although the outcome cannot be predicted with certainty  we have recorded a reserve with respect to these pending matters 
additionally  we are from time to time involved in other routine litigation incidental to the conduct of our business 
we are not aware of any other material existing or threatening litigation to which we are or may be a party

critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we have prepared the accompanying financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the following critical accounting policies in the preparation of these financial statements merchandise inventories as discussed in note business and basis of presentation in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of average cost or estimated net realizable value utilizing the retail method 
we perform periodic evaluations of the net realizable value of merchandise  including merchandise which is to be discontinued from our ongoing inventory assortment as well as inventory with excess quantities on hand and certain seasonal inventory remaining from past holidays 
based upon these evaluations  a provision for the excess of inventory cost over the net realizable value is recorded as a reduction to the net inventory balance 
at january  and january   we had reserves of  and  respectively  for certain merchandise  which is to be discontinued from our ongoing inventory assortment  as well as inventory with excess quantities on hand  and certain seasonal inventory from past holidays 
we receive vendor allowances principally as a result of meeting defined purchase levels or promoting vendors products 
those received as a result of purchase levels are accrued as a reduction of merchandise purchase price over the incentive period and result in a reduction of cost of sales as the merchandise is sold 
those received for promoting vendors products are offset against advertising expense and result in a reduction of selling  general and administrative expenses 
markdown allowances reduce cost of goods sold in the period the

accounting for long lived assets we perform an impairment evaluation for our long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 

long lived assets are evaluated for recoverability in accordance with sfas no 
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset may have been impaired 
in evaluating an asset for recoverability  we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and eventual disposition 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss  equal to the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the asset is recognized 
the fair market value of assets is determined primarily by market prices of similar assets at the stores 
due to missing internal sales targets and experience of negative comparable store sales in the current fiscal year  we evaluated our long lived assets 
based on current and projected performance  we recorded in fixed asset impairments 
there were no fixed asset impairments recognized in fiscal or fiscal after adjusting for the impairment charge  we believe the carrying value of the assets is appropriate 
we capitalize software in accordance with statement of position sop accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use sop

 accounting for leases sfas no 

certain leases provide for scheduled increases in base rentals over their terms 
for these leases we recognize the total rental amounts expected to be paid over the lease terms starting at the date of possession on a straight line basis and  accordingly  establish corresponding deferred rent liabilities for the difference between the amounts recognized and the amounts paid 
we also receive certain lease incentives which are deferred and amortized on a straight line basis over the initial term of a lease as a reduction of rent expense 
certain leases provide for contingent rentals based on sales in excess of specified minimums 
additional information is found in note lease commitments 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with the sfas no 
accounting for income taxes  sfas no 

temporary differences arising from differing treatment of income and expense items for tax and financial reporting purposes result in deferred tax assets and liabilities that are recorded on the balance sheet 
these balances  as well as income tax expense  are determined through management s estimations  interpretation of tax law for multiple jurisdictions and tax planning 
if our actual results differ from estimated results due to changes in tax laws  new store locations or tax planning  our effective tax rate and tax balances could be affected
