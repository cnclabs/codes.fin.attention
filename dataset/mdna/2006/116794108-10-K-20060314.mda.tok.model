executive overview bruker biosciences corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries design  manufacture  market and service proprietary life science systems based on mass spectrometry core technology platforms and x ray technologies 
we also manufacture and distribute a broad range of field analytical systems for nuclear  biological and chemical nbc detection 
we report financial results on the basis of two reportable segments bruker daltonics and bruker axs 
bruker daltonics is a leading manufacturer of innovative mass spectrometry based instruments and accessories used by pharmaceutical  biotechnology  proteomics and molecular diagnostics companies  academic institutions  and government agencies in their research that can also be integrated and used along with other analytical instruments 
bruker daltonics also manufactures and distributes a broad range of field analytical systems for nbc detection 
bruker axs primarily engages in the business of manufacturing and distributing advanced instrumentation and automated solutions based on x ray technology with the purpose of addressing the needs of our customers in the discovery of new drugs  drug targets and advanced materials  as well as industrial qa qc applications 
typical customers of bruker axs products and solutions include biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies  semiconductor industries  chemical  cement and petroleum companies  raw material manufacturers  and academic and government research institutions 
we maintain major technical centers in europe  north america and japan  have sales offices located throughout the world and our corporate headquarters is located in billerica  massachusetts 
our diverse customer base includes  among others  pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  academic institutions  semiconductor industries and government agencies 
our business strategy is to capitalize on our proven ability to innovate and generate rapid revenue growth  both organically and through acquisitions 
we believe our commitment to be an even more significant leader within the markets we serve should enable us to maintain above industry standard revenue growth rates 
these above industry standard growth rates combined with continued improvements to our gross profit margins and increased leverage on our research and development  sales and marketing and distribution investments and general and administrative expenses  are expected to enhance our operating margins and improve our earnings in the future 
in  our revenues grew by approximately to million from million in  compared to revenue growth in while our actual growth rate in was not in line with our expectations  this was due to demand from certain of our pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers being lower than historical levels and expectations in  but was partially offset by healthy demand for our products and solutions from other industrial customers  as well as our academic  medical research and government agency customers 
during  our commitment to reach profitability was achieved through improved gross profit margins from to and reduced operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreasing from in to in these improvements resulted in net income of million in  compared to a net loss of million in we also generated strong cash flows from operations in of approximately million compared to a use of cash from operations of approximately million in  and this was achieved through improved earnings and an increased focus on balance sheet management resulting in significant reductions in inventory and increases in customer deposits 
we believe our continued investments in research and development efforts  incremental sales and marketing efforts and global manufacturing  distribution and logistics networks will contribute to our top and bottom line growth going forward 
to achieve our business goal of maintaining above industry standard growth  we have also completed several acquisitions which provide us with products and solutions which complement our existing technologies and expand the market segments available to us 
most recently  in november  we acquired roentec ag roentec  an x ray microanalysis instrumentation company based in berlin  germany and the x ray microanalysis business of princeton gamma tech instruments  inc pgt  a company located in rocky hill  new jersey 
roentec and pgt together now comprise our new bruker axs microanalysis group with products that analyze the chemical composition of materials under investigation in electron microscopes 
these systems are used for a wide range of applications including nanotechnology and advanced materials research  as well as materials analysis and quality control and typical customers include industrial customers  academia and government research facilities 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventories  goodwill  long lived assets  warranty costs  income taxes  contingencies  and restructuring 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience  current market and economic conditions  our observance of industry trends and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable and form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from system sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  title and risk of loss has been transferred to the customer and collectibility of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
title and risk of loss is generally transferred to the customer upon receipt of a signed customer acceptance form for a system that has been shipped  installed  and for which the customer has been trained 
as a result  the timing of customer acceptance or readiness could cause our reported revenues to differ materially from expectations 
when products are sold through an independent distributor  a strategic distribution partner or an unconsolidated affiliated distributor  which assumes responsibility for installation  we recognize the system sale when the product has been shipped and title and risk of loss has been transferred 
our distributors do not have price protection rights or rights to return  however  our products are warranted to be free from defect for a period of one year 
revenue is deferred until cash is received when a significant portion of the fee is due over one year after delivery  installation and acceptance of a system 
for arrangements with multiple elements  we recognize revenue for each element based on the fair value of the element provided all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
the fair value for each element provided in multiple element arrangements is typically determined by referencing historical pricing policies when the element is sold separately 
changes in our ability to establish the fair value for each element in multiple element arrangements could affect the timing of revenue recognition 
revenue from accessories and parts is recognized upon shipment and service revenue is recognized as the services are performed 
warranty costs 
we normally provide a one year parts and labor warranty with the purchase of equipment 
the anticipated cost for this one year warranty is accrued upon recognition of the sale and is included as a current liability on the balance sheet 
although our facilities undergo quality assurance and testing procedures throughout the production process  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
although our actual warranty costs have historically been consistent with expectations  to the extent warranty claim activity or costs associated with servicing those claims differ from our estimates  revisions to the warranty accrual may be required 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined by the first in  first out method 
we maintain an allowance for excess and obsolete inventory to reflect the expected un saleable or un refundable inventory based on an evaluation of slow moving products 
if ultimate usage or demand varies significantly from expected usage or demand  additional write downs may be required  resulting in a charge to operations 
goodwill  other intangible assets  investments in other companies  and other long lived assets 
we perform an evaluation of whether goodwill is impaired annually or when events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
fair value is determined using market comparables for similar businesses or forecasts of discounted future cash flows 
we also review other intangible assets  investments in other companies  and other long lived assets when indication of potential impairment exists  such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets 
should the fair value of our long lived assets decline because of reduced operating performance  market declines  or other indicators of impairment  a charge to operations for impairment may be necessary 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to pay amounts due 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  reducing their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required  resulting in a charge to operations 
income taxes 
we estimate the degree to which tax assets and loss carryforwards will result in a benefit based on expected profitability by tax jurisdiction  and provide a valuation allowance for tax assets and loss carryforwards that we believe will more likely than not go unused 
if it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset or loss carryforward will be used for which a reserve has been provided  we reverse the related valuation allowance 
if our actual future taxable income by tax jurisdiction differ from estimates  additional allowances or reversals of reserves may be necessary

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are potentially exposed to market risk associated with changes in foreign exchange and interest rates for which we selectively use financial instruments to reduce related market risks 
an instrument is treated as a hedge if it is effective in offsetting the impact of volatility in our underlying exposure 
we have also entered into instruments which are not effective derivatives under the requirements of sfas no 
 and therefore such instruments are not designated as hedges 
all transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to our policies and procedures 
analytical techniques used to manage and monitor foreign exchange and interest rate risk include market valuations and sensitivity analysis 
the company regularly invests excess cash in overnight repurchase agreements and interest bearing investment grade securities that we hold for the duration of the term of the respective instrument and are subject to changes in short term interest rates 
the company believes that the market risk arising from holding these financial instruments is minimal 
the company s exposure to market risks associated with changes in interest rates relates primarily to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest income earned on its investment portfolio 
the company ensures the safety and preservation of invested funds by limiting default risks  market risk and reinvestment risk 
the company mitigates default risk by investing in investment grade securities 
declines in interest rates over time will  however  reduce the company s interest income 
impact of foreign currencies we sell products in many countries  and a substantial portion of sales and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies  principally in the euro and japanese yen 
fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the us dollar and foreign currencies could adversely affect our financial results 
costs related to these sales are largely denominated in the same respective currencies  thereby limiting our transaction risk exposure 
however  for sales not denominated in us dollars  if there is an increase in the rate at which a foreign currency is exchanged for us dollars  it will require more of the foreign currency to equal a specified amount of us dollars than before the rate increase 
in such cases  if we price our products in the foreign currency  we will receive less in us dollars than we did before the rate increase went into effect 
if we price our products in us dollars and competitors price their products in local currency  an increase in the relative strength of the us dollar could result in our prices not being competitive in a market where business is transacted in the local currency 
while we may from time to time hedge specifically identified cash flows in foreign currencies using forward contracts  this foreign currency activity historically has not been material 
the maturities of the forward exchange contracts  if or when entered into  generally would coincide with the settlement dates of the related transactions 
realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts would be recognized in the same period as gains and losses on the hedged items 
as of december   there were no foreign currency forward contracts outstanding 
realized foreign exchange gains losses were approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
as we continue to expand internationally  we evaluate currency risks and may enter into foreign exchange contracts on a more consistent basis or from time to time as the circumstances require to mitigate foreign currency exposure 
we have entered into foreign denominated debt obligations 
the currency effects of the debt obligations are reflected in interest and other income expense  net  on the consolidated statement of operations 
we also have foreign denominated intercompany borrowing arrangements with our bruker daltonik gmbh subsidiary in germany  our bruker axs gmbh subsidiary in germany and our bruker nonius subsidiary in the netherlands that affected accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
a increase or decrease of the respective foreign exchange rate with our bruker daltonik gmbh subsidiary in germany would result in a change in accumulated other comprehensive income loss of approximately million 
a increase or decrease of the respective foreign exchange rate with our bruker axs subsidiary in germany would result in a transaction gain loss of approximately million or million  respectively 
a increase or decrease of the respective foreign exchange rate with our bruker nonius subsidiary in the netherlands would result in a change in accumulated other comprehensive income loss of approximately million or million  respectively 
impact of interest rates our exposure related to adverse movements in interest rates is derived primarily from outstanding floating rate debt instruments that are indexed to short term market rates and cash equivalents 
our objective in managing our exposure to interest rates is to decrease the volatility that changes in interest rates might have on our earnings and cash flows 
to achieve this objective  we use a fixed rate agreement to adjust a portion of our debt that is subject to variable interest rates 
in the united states  we have entered into an interest rate swap arrangement to limit the interest rate exposure on our million industrial revenue bond to a fixed rate of 
we pay a fixed rate of interest and receive a variable rate of interest based on the bond market association municipal swap index on a million notional amount 
net interest payments or receipts are recorded as adjustments to interest expense 
in addition  the instrument is recorded at fair market value on our balance sheet  and changes in the fair market value are recorded in current earnings since the arrangement is not considered an effective hedge 
as of december   the fair value of the instrument was approximately million  net of tax  and is recorded as a liability on the balance sheet 
in  we entered into two derivative financial instruments  a cross currency interest rate swap and an interest rate swap 
the cross currency interest rate swap of million euro secures a fixed interest rate of per annum until january  the interest rate swap of million euro reduces the month euribor rate by per annum until january  we entered into the financial instruments to manage our exposure to interest rates and foreign exchange risk 
during the year ended december   we entered into three financial instruments  an interest rate cap  an interest rate swap and a cross currency interest rate swap 
by entering into these financial instruments  we obtained the right to borrow money at lower rates of interest 
we continue to hold these financial instruments until we elect to exercise the options to borrow the money 
until the instruments become an effective hedge  the instruments are considered speculative and are marked to market through interest and other income expense  net  on the consolidated statement of operations 
the fair value of the instruments appreciated depreciated by million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
as of december   the fair value of the instruments was approximately million net of tax  and is recorded as a liability on the balance sheet 
a increase or decrease in the average cost of our variable rate debt would not result in a material change in pre tax interest expense 
inflation we do not believe inflation had a material impact on our business or operating results during any of the periods presented 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  a replacement of apb opinion no 
 accounting changes and fasb statement no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements sfas 
sfas provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections 
it establishes  unless impracticable  retrospective application as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle in the absence of explicit transition requirements specific to the newly adopted accounting principle 
sfas also provides guidance for determining whether retrospective application of a change in accounting principle is impracticable and for reporting a change when retrospective application is impracticable 
the provisions of this statement are effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal periods beginning after december  the adoption of the provisions of sfas is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised share based payment sfas no 
r that addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions in which a company receives employee services in exchange for a equity instruments of the company or b liabilities that are based on the fair value of the company s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
sfas no 
r addresses all forms of share based payment awards  including shares issued under employee stock purchase plans  stock options  restricted stock and stock appreciation rights 
sfas no 
r eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  that was provided in sfas as originally issued 
as permitted by sfas no 
r  the company currently accounts for share based payments to employees using the intrinsic value method allowed under apb opinion and  as such  generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas no 
r fair value method will have a significant impact on the company s results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the impact of adoption of sfas no 
r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted sfas no 
r in prior periods  the impact would have approximated the amounts calculated using sfas no 
as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income loss and net income loss per share in note to our consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no

this statement amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
in addition  this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overhead to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions of this statement will be effective for the company beginning with its fiscal year ending we are currently evaluating the impact of this new standard  but believe that it will not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows
