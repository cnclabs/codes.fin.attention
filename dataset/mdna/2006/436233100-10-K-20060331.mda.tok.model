allowance for doubtful accounts hollywood media maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the company s accounting for doubtful accounts contains uncertainty because management must use judgment to assess the collectibility of these accounts 
when preparing these estimates  management considers a number of factors  including the aging of a customer s account  past transactions with customers  creditworthiness of specific customers  historical trends and other information 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was  and  at december  and  respectively 
although the company believes its allowance is sufficient  if the financial condition of the company s customers were to unexpectedly deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required that could materially impact the company s consolidated financial statements 
concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of customers comprising the company s customer base and their dispersion across many different geographical regions 
the allowance for doubtful accounts increased primarily due to the acquisition of cinemasonline

advertising costs hollywood media expenses the cost of advertising as incurred or when such advertising initially takes place 
during  hollywood media issued common stock and warrants to cbs with a fair value of approximately million in exchange for approximately million of advertising on cbs properties to be received over a period of seven years 
hollywood media was entitled to utilize a specified portion of this advertising each contract year

self insurance accruals hollywood media maintains self insured retentions for its health benefits programs and limits its exposure by maintaining stop loss and aggregate liability coverage 
the estimate of the company s self insurance liability contains uncertainty since management must use judgment to estimate the ultimate cost that will be incurred to settle reported claims and unreported claims for incidents incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date 
when estimating the company s self insurance liability  management considers a number of factors  which include historical claim experience 
the self insurance program was initiated in june management recorded the maximum amount of potential liability under the stop loss insurance coverage due to the lack of historical claims experience data available under the current self insurance plan 
the former plan has months remaining under the tail provision  which the company currently has  accrued for potential residual claims

 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 
 we have chosen to account for our stock plan under the intrinsic value method as allowed by accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb no 
and related interpretations 
under apb no 
 because the exercise price of our employee stock options typically equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant  no compensation expense is typically recorded upon grant except as discussed in note supplemental disclosure of noncash investing and financial activities in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
sfas no 
requires disclosure of the estimated fair value of our employee stock options granted and pro forma financial information assuming compensation expense was recorded using these fair values 
determining the fair value of stock options requires the company to make assumptions regarding the key variables of a stock option pricing model which includes expected volatility  estimated life and dividend yield 
these estimates are sensitive to changes in several factors including market conditions

the company has adopted the provisions of the statement as of january  adoption of the standard may have a material impact on the results of operations in future periods

impairment of long lived assets effective december   hollywood media adopted sfas no

consistent with sfas no 
 sfas no 
requires impairment losses to be recorded on long lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amount 
we evaluate the recoverability of long lived assets not held for sale by comparing the carrying amount of the assets to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows associated with them 
at the time such evaluations indicate that the future undiscounted cash flows of certain long lived assets are not sufficient to recover the carrying values of such assets  the assets are adjusted to their fair values 
we determined fair value as the net present value of future cash flows 
based on these evaluations  there were no adjustments to the carrying value of long lived assets in   or other than the asset write downs discussed in note goodwill and other intangible assets  in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

under sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets acquired after june  were no longer subject to amortization 
goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives acquired prior to june  ceased to be amortized beginning january  in addition  sfas changed the way we evaluated goodwill and intangibles for impairment 
beginning january   goodwill and certain intangibles are no longer amortized  however  they are subject to evaluation for impairment at least annually using a fair value based test 
the fair value based test is a two step test 
the first step involved comparing the fair value of each of our reporting units to the carrying value of those reporting units 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  we are required to proceed to the second step 
in the second step  the fair value of the reporting unit would be allocated to the assets including unrecognized intangibles and liabilities of the reporting unit  with any residual representing the implied fair value of goodwill 
an impairment loss would be recognized if and to the extent that the carrying value of goodwill exceeded the implied value 

table of contents as prescribed by sfas no 
 we completed the transitional goodwill impairment test by the second quarter of which did not result in an impairment charge 
additionally  hollywood media established october  as its annual impairment test date and conducted required testing on that date in  and and there were no adjustments to the carrying value of long lived assets other than the asset write downs discussed in note goodwill and other intangible assets  in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
as of december   we are not aware of any items or events that would cause us to adjust the recorded value of hollywood media s goodwill for impairment 
future changes in estimates used to conduct the impairment review  including revenue projections or market values could cause the analysis to indicate that hollywood media s goodwill is impaired in subsequent periods and result in a write off of a portion or all of the goodwill 
in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations of our reporting units on the impairment calculation  we applied a hypothetical decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit 
this hypothetical decrease would not result in the impairment of goodwill of any reporting unit 
inflation and seasonality although we cannot accurately determine the precise effects of inflation  we do not believe inflation has a material effect on revenue or results of operations 
we consider our business to be somewhat seasonal and expect net revenues to be generally higher during the second and fourth quarters of each fiscal year for our tekno books book licensing business as a result of the general publishing industry practice of paying royalties semi annually 
the broadway ticketing business is also effected by seasonal variations with net revenues generally higher in the second quarter as a result of increased sales volumes due to the tony awards and in the fourth quarter due to increased levels during the holiday period 
in addition  although not seasonal  our intellectual properties division and netco partners both experience fluctuations in their respective revenue streams  earnings and cash flow as a result of the amount of time that is expended in the creation and development of the intellectual properties and their respective licensing agreements 
the recognition of licensing revenue is typically triggered by specific contractual events which occur at different points in time rather than on a regular periodic basis 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in our assets or liabilities that might occur due to changes in market rates and prices  such as interest or foreign currency exchange rates  as well as other relevant market rate or price changes 
interest rates charged on hollywood media s debt instruments are primarily fixed in nature 
we therefore do not believe that the risk of loss relating to the effect of changes in market interest rates is material 
we have an investment in a subsidiary in the united kingdom and sell our services into this foreign market 
our foreign net asset exposures defined as assets denominated in foreign currency less liabilities denominated in foreign currency for the united kingdom at december  of us dollar equivalents was  our united kingdom subsidiary sells services and pays for products and services in british pounds 
a decrease in the british foreign currency relative to the us dollar could adversely impact our margins 
an assumed depreciation of these foreign currencies relative to the us dollar over the course of ie  in addition to actual exchange experience would have resulted in a translation reduction of our revenue by  for as the assets  liabilities and transactions of our united kingdom subsidiary are denominated in british pounds  the results and financial condition are subject to translation adjustments upon their conversion into us dollars for our financial reporting purposes 
a decline in this foreign currency relative to the us dollar over the course of us  in addition to actual exchange experience would not have had a material impact on operating loss as the combined foreign operations were approximately break even for the one month of operations included in the consolidated statement of operations 
the final month of the year is considered seasonally slow for cinemasonline 
however  a larger decline in the british foreign currency could have a larger and possibly material adverse affect 

table of contents we purchase and sell live theater tickets to shows in london s west end 
we minimize our exposure to adverse changes in currency exchange rates by taking steps to reduce the time lag between the purchase and payment of tickets for the london shows and the collection of related sales proceeds 
we do not believe the risk of loss relating to adverse changes in currency exchange rates to be material
