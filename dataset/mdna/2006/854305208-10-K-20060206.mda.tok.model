item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and notes 
overview over the past few years the residential wood furniture industry has experienced a surge in low cost imported products  primarily from china 
imports have grown dramatically in the past few years and according to industry sources it is estimated that imports now account for over half of all residential wood furniture sold in the united states 
in response to this trend we developed a blended strategy of combining our domestic manufacturing capabilities with an offshore sourcing program and realigned our manufacturing capacity 
we incorporate selected imported component parts and finished items in our product line to lower costs  provide design flexibility  and offer a better value to our customers 
sourced products increased to approximately of our sales in compared to in we anticipate this percentage will be about in the increase in offshore sourcing created excess capacity in our manufacturing facilities which caused us to reduce and realign manufacturing capacity 
we closed a manufacturing facility in our former west end  north carolina factory and reduced operations at another manufacturing facility in we have realigned production so that each of our current manufacturing facilities is focused on specific product lines of compatible products to improve quality and lower production costs 
these actions reduced our manufacturing capacity by approximately to 
we operated at approximately to of this reduced capacity in we are maintaining our manufacturing capacity at this level to provide protective capacity for improved demand and to buffer supply chain disruptions on certain imported products 
we will continue to evaluate our manufacturing capacity needs considering offshore sourcing opportunities  current and anticipated demand for our products  overall market conditions and other factors we consider relevant 
should further capacity reductions become necessary  this could cause asset impairment or other restructuring charges in the future 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage relationship to net sales of certain items included in the consolidated statements of income for the years ended december  net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income other income  net interest income interest expense income before income taxes income taxes net income compared to net sales increased million  or  in compared to the increase was due primarily to higher average selling prices and to a lesser extent higher unit volume 
industry sales trends were positive in  however  it appears that sales trends slowed in the latter part of the year  starting in late third quarter 
gross profit margin for decreased to from in gross profit margin in was negatively impacted by inflation in raw materials  wages  employee benefits  energy costs  freight costs and tariffs imposed on wooden bedroom furniture imported from china 
operating inefficiencies in compared to also contributed to the lower gross profit margins 
partially offsetting these higher costs were increased selling prices 
we continue to experience inflationary pressures in raw materials  compensation cost  energy and freight costs 
selling  general and administrative expenditures increased million in this increase resulted from higher selling expenses directly attributable to the increase in sales  additional warehouse expense and increased compensation cost 
warehouse expense increased as a result of increased usage at our leased warehouse due to increased shipments of sourced product in compared to as a result of the above  operating income as a percentage of net sales was for  compared to for interest expense for decreased primarily due to lower average debt levels 
interest income increased during due to higher amounts of cash 
the effective tax rate for is  compared to for the decrease in the effective tax rate is a result of the american jobs creation act of which allows for a deduction based on qualified domestic production activities 
we expect a modest decline in our effective tax rate as this deduction is phased in over the next six years 
our effective tax rate for is expected to be in the range of to compared to net sales increased million  or  in compared to the increase was due primarily to higher unit volume and to a lesser extent higher average selling prices 
while industry sales trends improved in  we believe most of our growth came from market share gains 
gross profit margin for increased to from in higher gross profit margin in was primarily due to higher production levels at our domestic facilities and savings from sourcing initiatives 
inflation in raw materials  wages  employee benefits  energy costs and tariffs imposed on wooden bedroom furniture imported from china were offset with modest price increases 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were for both and selling  general and administrative expenditures increased in by million 
this increase resulted from higher selling expenses directly attributable to the increase in sales including additional warehouse expense  increased bonus expense due to higher earnings and cost incurred to comply with the sarbanes oxley act of these increases were partially offset by a  net reversal of bad debt expense in due to a reduction in accounts receivable from certain customers experiencing financial difficulties compared to a net reversal of  in as a result of the above  operating income as a percentage of net sales was for  compared to for interest expense for decreased primarily due to lower average debt levels 
the effective tax rate for was which was comparable to the effective tax rate 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity include cash on hand  cash from operations and amounts available under a million credit facility 
these sources have been adequate for day to day expenditures  debt payments  purchases of our stock  capital expenditures and payment of cash dividends to stockholders 
we expect these sources of liquidity to continue to be adequate for the future 
working capital  excluding cash and current maturities of long term debt  decreased million during to million from million in the decrease was primarily due to lower inventories 
with the increase of million in our authorization to repurchase shares of our common stock by the board of directors on january   approximately million is currently authorized 
consequently  we may  from time to time  either directly or through agents  repurchase our common stock in the open market  through negotiated purchases or otherwise  at prices and on terms satisfactory to us 
depending on market prices and other relevant conditions  such purchases may be discontinued at any time 
the board of directors increased the annual dividend policy to 
per share on january  cash generated from operations was million in compared to million in and million in the increase in was due to higher cash collections from customers due to higher sales  partially offset by higher payments to suppliers and employees primarily to fund higher production  increased purchases of sourced product and higher selling and administrative expenses 
the decrease in compared to was due to higher payments to suppliers and employees  partially offset by higher cash collections from customers 
payments to suppliers and employees increased in compared to  primarily to fund increased purchases of sourced products  higher production and higher selling and administrative expenses 
net cash used by investing activities was million in compared to million in and million in  respectively 
capital expenditures in consisted of normal machinery and equipment purchases and approximately  was used to improve the manufacturing flow and expand warehouse space at one of our facilities 
over the past three years  capital expenditures were lower due to the relocation of a significant portion of machinery and equipment from a facility we closed in to other facilities in lieu of normal replacements 
capital expenditures for have returned to more historic levels at approximately million and we expect to remain at about this level 
as both our sales and the proportion of sourced goods increased  our need for additional warehouse space has increased 
we are currently renting space to accommodate our needs  but continue to evaluate long term solutions which could result in additional future capital expenditures 
net cash used by financing activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in and  cash from operations and proceeds from the exercise of stock options provided funds for the purchase and retirement of our common stock  senior debt payments and cash dividends 
in  cash from operations and proceeds from the exercise of stock options provided funds for senior debt payments and cash dividends 
over the last three years million was used to purchase million shares of our common stock in the open market at an average price of 
at december   long term debt including current maturities was million 
debt service requirements are million in both and and million in each  and as of december   approximately million of borrowings were available under a revolving credit facility and cash on hand was million 
the following table sets forth our contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments at december  in thousands payment due or commitment expiration less than over total year years years years contractual cash obligations long term debt postretirement benefits other than pensions fixed interest payment on long term debt operating leases total contractual cash obligations other commercial commitments letters of credit the group annuity mortality tables were used in estimating future benefit payments  and the health care cost trend rate for determining payments is for and gradually declines to in where it is assumed to remain constant for the remaining years 
our pension plan is frozen and under current valuations holds sufficient assets to cover future benefit obligations 
therefore  we do not currently anticipate any cash funding needs to meet minimum required funding thresholds 
critical accounting policies we have chosen accounting policies that are necessary to accurately and fairly report our operational and financial position 
below are the critical accounting policies that involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful receivables for estimated losses resulting from the inability of trade customers to make required payments 
we provide an allowance for specific customer accounts where collection is doubtful and also provide an allowance for other accounts based on historical collection and write off experience 
judgment is critical because some customers have historically experienced financial difficulties 
as the financial condition of these customers and the related receivable balances change  the level of such allowances will be reevaluated 
inventory valuation inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost for all inventories is determined using the first in  first out fifo method 
we evaluate our inventory to determine excess or slow moving items based on current order activity and projections of future demand 
for those items identified  we estimate our market value or net sales value based on current trends 
those items having a net sales value less than cost are written down to their net sales value 
this process recognizes projected inventory losses when they become evident rather than at the time they are sold 
long lived assets property  plant and equipment is reviewed for possible impairment when events indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
assumptions and estimates used in the evaluation of impairment may affect the carrying value of long lived assets  which could result in impairment charges in future periods 
depreciation policy reflects judgments on the estimated useful lives of assets 
tax contingencies tax contingencies are recorded to address potential exposures involving tax positions we have taken that could be challenged by taxing authorities 
these potential exposures result from the varying applications of statutes  rules  regulations and interpretations 
our tax contingencies contain assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions 
the ultimate resolution of these matters may be greater or less than the amount that we have provided 
pension costs our pension expense is developed from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions  including discount rates used to determine the present value of future benefit payments and expected return on plan assets  which are usually updated on an annual basis at the beginning of each year 
we consider current market conditions  including changes in interest rates  in making these assumptions 
changes in pension costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions 
the key assumptions used in developing net pension costs were a discount rate of and an expected return on plan assets of compared to and for the discount rate and expected return on plan assets  respectively  in in establishing our expected return on plan assets assumption  we review asset allocation considering plan maturity and develop return assumptions based on different asset classes adjusting for plan operating expenses 
actual asset over under performance compared to expected returns will respectively decrease increase unrecognized loss 
the change in the unrecognized loss will change amortization cost in upcoming periods 
a one percentage point change in the expected return assumption in the current year would have resulted in a change in pension expense of  the discount rate is established by comparing the projection of expected benefit payments  using an assumption that of participants will elect to receive a lump sum payment upon retirement and participants currently receiving annuities will continue to receive benefits through a life annuity  to the citigroup pension discount curve published monthly as of december the expected benefit payments are discounted by each corresponding discount rate on the yield curve 
once the present value of the string of benefit payments is established  we solve for the single spot rate to apply to all obligations of the plan that will match the previously determined present value 
the citigroup pension discount curve is constructed beginning with a us treasury par curve that reflects the entire treasury and strips market 
from the treasury curve  citibank produces a double a corporate par curve by adding option adjusted spreads that are drawn from the double a corporate sector of the citigroup broad investment grade bond index 
finally  from the double a corporate par curve  citigroup derives the spot rates that constitute the pension discount curve 
for payments beyond years we extend the curve assuming that the discount rate derived in year is extended to the end of the plan s payment expectations 
self insurance we are self insured for certain claims related to medical insurance and workers compensation 
we maintain stop loss coverage with third party insurers to limit our total exposure 
the self insurance liability represents an estimate of the ultimate cost of claims incurred and unpaid as of the balance sheet date 
the estimated liability is established based upon analysis of historical data and is reviewed on a quarterly basis to ensure that the liability is appropriate 
if actual claims differ from our estimates  our financial results could be impacted 
tariffs imposed on wooden bedroom furniture imported from china tariff expense is based on the most current rates published by the department of commerce 
these rates are potentially subject to an administrative review process starting approximately one year after the publication date 
the final amounts will depend on whether administrative reviews are performed and the outcome of those reviews  if any  on the vendors we purchase from 
consequently  any significant adjustments to these tariff rates could have a material impact on our financial results 
we do not have transactions or relationships with special purpose entities  and we do not have any off balance sheet financing other than normal operating leases primarily for showroom  warehousing space and certain technology equipment 
continued dumping and subsidy offset act the continued dumping and subsidy offset act cdsoa provides for distribution of monies collected by us customs from antidumping cases to qualifying domestic producers where the domestic producers have continued to invest in their technology  equipment and people 
we received  in cdsoa payments in the world trade organization wto has ruled that such payments violate international trade rules and the us trade representative appealed this ruling  however  the wto upheld the ruling 
legislation is pending in the u 
s 
congress to repeal cdsoa distributions to qualifying domestic producers for tariffs collected after september  according to us customs and border protection  as of october   approximately  has been collected in tariffs and is potentially available for distribution under cdsoa to injured domestic manufacturers in connection with the case involving wooden bedroom furniture imported from china 
these funds are subject to adjustment as the amount of the actual duties is determined retrospectively after the results of any annual administrative reviews conducted by the us department of commerce 
further  certain importers have appealed the initial findings of the anti dumping order to the court of international trade and favorable rulings for these importers could reduce the amount of duties ultimately available for distribution 
these funds are not available for distribution until all legal appeals and administrative reviews have been completed 
consequently  the amount ultimately available for distribution in this case during will depend on amounts collected through december  and the result of any administrative reviews and pending legal appeals 
also  any amount we may receive will depend on our percentage allocation  which is based on our qualifying expenditures in relation to the qualifying expenditures of other injured domestic producers requesting distribution for the relevant time periods under cdsoa 
our percentage allocation for payments received in was approximately 
in view of the uncertainties associated with this program  we are unable to predict the amounts  if any  we may receive in or thereafter under cdsoa 
however  assuming cdsoa distributions continue  these distributions could be material depending on the results of legal appeals and administrative reviews  and our actual percentage allocation 
new accounting standards in november  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
 inventory costs 
the new statement amends accounting research bulletin no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material 
this statement requires that those items be recognized as current period charges and requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the cost of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we do not expect adoption of this statement to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment 
this statement replaces fasb statement no 
and supersedes apb opinion no 
statement no 
r will require the fair value of all stock option awards issued to employees to be recorded as an expense over the related vesting period 
the statement also requires the recognition of compensation expense for the fair value of any unvested stock option awards outstanding at the date of adoption 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies  for the pro forma effect on our net income and earnings per share of applying sfas no 
r 
the securities and exchange commission has ruled that fas r is now effective for public companies for annual periods that began after june  accordingly  we will adopt fas r in the first quarter of in may  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting changes and error corrections 
the statement applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle and to changes required by an accounting pronouncement that do not include explicit transition provisions 
sfas no 
requires that changes in accounting principle be retroactively applied  instead of including the cumulative effect in the income statement 
the correction of an error will continue to require financial statement restatement 
a change in accounting estimate will continue to be accounted for in the period of change and in subsequent periods  if necessary 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s our obligation under the revolving credit facility bears interest at a variable rate  therefore  changes in prevailing interest rates impact our borrowing costs 
a one percentage point fluctuation in market interest rates would not have had a material impact on earnings in none of our foreign sales or purchases are denominated in foreign currency and we do not have any foreign currency hedging transactions 
while our foreign purchases are denominated in us dollars  a relative decline in the value of the us dollar could result in an increase in the cost of our component parts and finished items obtained from offshore sourcing and reduce our earnings  unless we are able to increase our prices for these items to reflect any such increased cost
