overview we are the leading provider  based on market share  of application services that allow organizations to easily share customer information on demand  according to an august report by idc 
we provide a comprehensive crm service to businesses of all sizes and industries worldwide 
we were founded in february and began offering our on demand crm application service in february in order to increase our revenues and take advantage of our market opportunity  we will need to continue to add substantial numbers of paying subscriptions 
we plan to re invest our revenues for the foreseeable future by expanding our data center capacity and upgrading our new development and test data center  hiring additional personnel  particularly in customer related areas  expanding our domestic and international selling and marketing activities  increasing our research and development activities to upgrade and extend our service offerings and to develop new services and technologies  expanding the number of locations around the world where we conduct business  adding to our infrastructure to support our growth  and expanding our operational systems to manage a growing business 
additionally  in our effort to further strengthen and extend our service offering  we may also in the future acquire or make investments in complementary companies  services and technologies 
as our revenues increase  we expect marketing and sales costs  which were percent of our total revenues for fiscal and percent of our total revenues for the same period a year ago  to continue to represent a substantial portion of total revenues in the future as we seek to add and manage more paying subscribers  build brand awareness and increase the number of marketing events that we sponsor 

table of contents fiscal year our fiscal year ends on january references to fiscal  for example  refer to the fiscal year ended january  sources of revenues we derive our revenues from two sources subscription revenues  which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our on demand application service  and from customers purchasing additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fee  and related professional services and other revenues 
other revenues consist primarily of training fees 
subscription and support revenues accounted for percent of our total revenues during fiscal and percent during the same period a year ago 
subscription revenues are driven primarily by the number of paying subscribers of our service and the subscription price of our service 
none of our customers accounted for more than percent of our revenues during fiscal and subscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement dates of each contract 
the typical subscription and support term is to months  although terms range from one to months 
our subscription and support contracts are noncancelable  though customers typically have the right to terminate their contracts for cause if we materially fail to perform 
we generally invoice our customers in advance  in annual or quarterly installments  and typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within days of invoice 
amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue  or in revenue depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met 
in general  we collect our billings in advance of the subscription service period 
professional services and other revenues consist of fees associated with consulting and implementation services and training 
our consulting and implementation engagements are typically billed on a time and materials basis 
we also offer a number of classes on implementing  using and administering our service that are billed on a per person  per class basis 
our typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within days of invoice 
cost of revenues and operating expenses cost of revenues 
cost of subscription and support revenues primarily consists of expenses related to hosting our service and providing support  the costs of additional data center capacity  depreciation or operating lease expense associated with computer equipment  costs associated with website development activities  allocated overhead and amortization expense associated with capitalized software 
to date  the amortization expense associated with capitalized software has not been material to our cost of revenues 
we allocate overhead such as rent and occupancy charges  employee benefit costs and taxes to all departments based on headcount 
as such  general overhead expenses are reflected in each cost of revenue and operating expense category 
cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of employee related costs associated with these services  the cost of subcontractors and allocated overhead 
the cost associated with providing professional services is significantly higher as a percentage of revenue than for our on demand subscription service due to the labor costs associated with providing professional services 
to the extent that our customer base grows  we intend to continue to invest additional resources in our on demand application service and in our consulting services 
the timing of these additional expenses will affect our cost of revenues  both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues  in a particular quarterly period 
for example  we plan to increase the number of employees who are fully dedicated to consulting services 
we have also obtained additional data center capacity on the west and east coasts of the united states 
we expect the annual cost of these resources to be significant 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses  the costs of upgrading our new development and test data center and allocated overhead 
we have 
table of contents historically focused our research and development efforts on increasing the functionality and enhancing the ease of use of our on demand application service 
our proprietary  scalable and secure multi tenant architecture enables us to provide all of our customers with a service based on a single version of our application 
as a result  we do not have to maintain multiple versions  which enables us to have relatively low research and development expenses as compared to traditional enterprise software companies 
we expect that in the future  research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we upgrade and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies 
we recently upgraded our new development and test data center 
we expect the annual cost of this data center to be significant 
marketing and sales 
marketing and sales expenses are our largest cost and consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for our sales and marketing staff  including commissions  payments to partners  marketing programs and allocated overhead 
marketing programs consist of advertising  events  corporate communications and brand building and product marketing activities 
as our revenues increase  we plan to continue to invest heavily in marketing and sales by increasing the number of direct sales personnel in order to add new customers and increase penetration within our existing customer base  expanding our domestic and international selling and marketing activities  building brand awareness and sponsoring additional marketing events 
we expect that in the future  marketing and sales expenses will increase in absolute dollars and continue to be our largest cost 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related expenses for finance and accounting  human resources and management information systems personnel  legal costs  professional fees  other corporate expenses and allocated overhead 
we expect that in the future  general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we add personnel and incur additional professional fees and insurance costs related to the growth of our business  international expansion and operations as a public company  including the cost of our compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act 
stock based expenses 
our cost of revenues and operating expenses include stock based expenses related to options and warrants issued to non employees  option grants to employees in situations where the exercise price was less than the deemed fair value of our common stock at the date of grant and stock awards to board members for board services 
these charges have been significant and are reflected in our historical financial results 
these amounts do not include the incremental costs and operating expenses associated with the new accounting pronouncement to expense stock options  which we will adopt at the start of fiscal joint venture in december  we established a japanese joint venture  kabushiki kaisha salesforce 
com  with sunbridge  inc  a japanese corporation  to assist us with our sales efforts in japan 
as of january   we owned a percent interest in the joint venture 
because of this majority interest  we consolidate the venture s financial results  which are reflected in each revenue  cost of revenues and expense category in our consolidated statement of operations 
we then record minority interest  which reflects the minority investors interest in the venture s results  exclusive of intercompany charges 
through january   the operating performance and liquidity requirements of the japanese joint venture had not been significant 
while we plan to expand our selling and marketing activities in japan in order to add new customers  we believe the future operating performance and liquidity requirements of the japanese joint venture will not be significant 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make 
table of contents estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  costs and expenses  and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  which are described in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements  the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity 
accordingly  these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition and emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
we recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the service has been provided to the customer  the collection of our fees is reasonably assured  and the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable 
our arrangements do not contain general rights of return 
we recognize subscription revenues ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement dates of each contract 
support revenues from customers who purchase our premium support offerings are recognized similarly over the term of the support contract 
as part of their subscription agreements  customers benefit from new features and functionality with each release at no additional cost 
in situations where we have contractually committed to an individual customer specific technology  we defer all of the revenue for that customer until the technology is delivered and accepted 
once delivery occurs  we then recognize the revenue over the remaining contract term 
consulting services and training revenues are accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues when these services have value to the customer on a standalone basis and there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value of each deliverable 
when accounted for separately  revenues are recognized as the services are rendered for time and material contracts  and when the milestones are achieved and accepted by the customer for fixed price contracts 
the majority of our consulting service contracts are on a time and material basis 
training revenues are recognized after the services are performed 
for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  we allocate the total customer arrangement to the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values  as determined by the price of the undelivered items when sold separately 
in determining whether the consulting services can be accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues  we consider the following factors for each consulting agreement availability of the consulting services from other vendors  whether objective and reliable evidence for fair value exists for the undelivered elements  the nature of the consulting services  the timing of when the consulting contract was signed in comparison to the subscription service start date  and the contractual dependence of the subscription service on the customer s satisfaction with the consulting work 
if a consulting arrangement does not qualify for separate accounting  we recognize the consulting revenue ratably over the remaining term of the subscription contract 
additionally  in these situations we defer the direct costs of the consulting arrangement and amortize those costs over the same time period as the consulting revenue is recognized 
the deferred cost on our consolidated balance sheet totaled  at january  and  at january  accounting for deferred commissions 
we defer commission payments to our direct sales force 
the commissions are deferred and amortized to sales expense over the noncancelable terms of the related subscription contracts with our customers  which are typically to months 
the commission payments  which are paid in full the month after the customer s service commences  are a direct and incremental cost of the revenue arrangements 
the deferred commission amounts are recoverable through the future revenue streams under the noncancelable customer contracts 
we believe this is the preferable method of accounting as the 
table of contents commission charges are so closely related to the revenue from the noncancelable customer contracts that they should be recorded as an asset and charged to expense over the same period that the subscription revenue is recognized 
during fiscal  we deferred million of commission expenditures and we amortized million to sales expense 
during the same period a year ago  we deferred million of commission expenditures and we amortized million to sales expense 
deferred commissions on our consolidated balance sheet totaled million at january  and million at january  accounting for stock based awards 
we recorded deferred stock based compensation charges in the amount by which the exercise price of an option is less than the deemed fair value of our common stock at the date of grant 
we have elected not to record stock based compensation expense when employee stock options are awarded at exercise prices equal to the deemed fair value of our common stock at the date of grant 
prior to the establishment of a public market for our stock in june  our board of directors determined the fair value of our common stock based upon several factors  including  but not limited to  our operating and financial performance  private sales of our common and preferred stock between third parties  issuances of convertible preferred stock and appraisals performed by an appraisal firm 
the fair value of our common stock is now determined by the trading price of our stock on the new york stock exchange 
we amortize the deferred compensation charges ratably over the four year vesting period of the underlying option awards 
as of january   we had an aggregate of million of deferred stock based compensation remaining to be amortized 
on february   which is the start of our fiscal  we will begin to recognize in our consolidated statement of operations the cost of employee stock options in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas r see recent accounting pronouncement below for further discussion 
we believe that the adoption of sfas r will materially reduce our fiscal reported results of operations 
in the past  we have awarded a limited number of stock options and warrants to non employees 
for these options and warrants  we recognize stock based compensation expense over the vesting periods of the underlying awards  based on an estimate of their fair value on the vesting dates using the black scholes option pricing model 
as of january   we had recognized compensation expense on all options and warrants issued to non employees except for options for  shares of our common stock  all of which will fully vest by july and have an exercise price of per share 
accounting for income taxes 
we account for income taxes using the liability method  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets or liabilities for the tax effected temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
the tax expense or benefit for unusual items  tax exposure items or adjustments to the valuation allowance are treated as discrete items in the interim period in which the events occur 
prior to fiscal  we recorded a full valuation allowance to reserve for the benefit of our deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty surrounding our ability to realize these assets 
during fiscal  we recorded an income tax benefit of million  which included a partial reversal of the valuation allowance related to certain of our deferred tax assets 
the company continues to maintain a million valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets attributable to employee stock option exercises and operating losses from certain foreign subsidiaries 
future reductions in the valuation allowance related to employee stock option activity  which was approximately million of the total valuation allowance as of january   will be recorded to additional paid in capital

additionally  during fiscal  we incurred substantial costs and operating expenses related to the expansion of our business

table of contents revenues were million  or percent of total revenues  for the year ended january   compared to million  or percent of total revenues  during the same period a year ago

the increase in professional services and other revenues was due primarily to the higher demand for services from an increased number of paying subscribers and customers 
revenues in europe and asia pacific accounted for million  or percent of total revenues  during the year ended january   compared to million  or percent of total revenues  during the same period a year ago  an increase of million  or percent 
the increase in revenues outside of the americas was the result of our efforts to expand the number of locations around the world where we conduct business and our international selling and marketing activities 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues was million  or percent of total revenues  during the year ended january   compared to million  or percent of total revenues  during the same period a year ago  an increase of million 
the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of million in employee related costs  primarily all of which was due to the percent increase in the headcount of our professional services organization since january   an increase of million in service delivery costs  primarily due to our efforts in adding data center capacity  an increase of million in depreciation and amortization expenses  an increase of million in outside subcontractor and other service costs and an increase of million in allocated overhead charges 
the cost of the additional professional services headcount resulted in the cost of professional services and other revenues to be in excess of the related revenue during the year ended january  by million 
we increased the professional services headcount in order to meet the anticipated demand for our consulting and training services as our subscriber base has expanded 
as described above  we intend to continue to invest additional resources in our on demand application service and in our capacity to deliver professional services 
the timing of these additional expenses  together with the requirement to expense stock options beginning in fiscal  will affect our cost of revenues  both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues 
we believe that our cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues will approximate recent percentages  exclusive of the new requirement to expense stock options 
research and development 
research and development expenses were million  or percent of total revenues  during the year ended january   compared to million  or percent of total revenues  during the same period a year ago  an increase of million 
the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of million in employee related costs  an increase of million in equipment and service costs primarily due to upgrading our new development and test data center and a million increase in allocated overhead charges 
we increased our research and development headcount by percent since january  in order to upgrade and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies

marketing and sales 
marketing and sales expenses were million  or percent of total revenues  during the year ended january   compared to million  or percent of total revenues  during the same period a year ago  an increase of million 
the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase of million in employee related costs  million in marketing spending related to new service offerings  advertising and events and a million increase in allocated overhead

general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses were million  or percent of total revenues  during the year ended january   compared to million  or percent of total revenues  
table of contents during the same period a year ago  an increase of million 
the increase was primarily due to an increase of million in employee related costs  million in professional and outside service costs and million in infrastructure related costs  which were offset by million in increased allocated charges to non general and administrative departments 
our general and administrative headcount increased by percent since january  as we added personnel to support our growth 
lease recovery 
the lease recovery of  which occurred during the first quarter of fiscal  was due to the reduction in accruals associated with the san francisco  california office space that we abandoned in december in march  we entered into an agreement with our primary landlord that released us from a portion of the future obligations associated with the remaining space abandoned in exchange for an agreement to lease additional space elsewhere in the building at fair value 
accordingly  we recorded a  credit to reflect the reversal of a portion of the accrual that was directly related to this space 
operating income 
operating income during the year ended january  was million 
during the same period a year ago  it was million 
the increase was primarily due to the increase in revenues  most of which was re invested in an effort to expand our business 
interest income 
interest income consists of investment income on cash and marketable securities balances 
during the year ended january   interest income also included the interest income on outstanding loans made to individuals who early exercised their stock options 
none of these individuals was an executive officer or director of the company and all of them repaid their loan balances by february  interest income was million during the year ended january  and was million during the same period a year ago 
the increase was primarily due to increased marketable securities balances resulting from the million of net proceeds from the sale of our common stock in our initial public offering in june and the cash generated by operating activities since january  benefit provision for income taxes 
we recorded a benefit for income taxes of million during the year ended january   compared to a provision for income taxes of million during the same period a year ago 
included in the million benefit for income taxes was a partial reversal of the valuation allowance related to certain of our deferred tax assets totaling million 
prior to fiscal  we recorded a full valuation allowance to reserve for the benefit of our deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty surrounding our ability to realize these assets 
as of january   we had million of deferred tax assets  net of deferred tax liabilities  on our consolidated balance sheet 
as of the same date  the company continues to maintain a million valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets attributable to employee stock option exercises and operating losses from certain foreign subsidiaries 
future reductions in the valuation allowance related to employee stock option activity  which was approximately million of the total valuation allowance as of january   will be recorded to additional paid in capital 
to realize the deferred tax assets related to foreign operations  pretax income in those jurisdictions must increase sufficiently to allow management to assume that such deferred tax assets will be utilized 
historic profits in those jurisdictions have proven insufficient to allow us to absorb deferred tax assets incurred to date 
without the reduction in our valuation allowance  the effective tax rate for fiscal would have been approximately percent 
this effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate primarily due to the utilization of previously unrecognized domestic loss carryovers offset by losses in certain foreign jurisdictions for which no benefit was recognized 
we currently believe that our fiscal effective tax rate will be significantly higher than in fiscal our future effective tax rate is based on the projected mix of full year income in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate  the related income tax expense in each jurisdiction and the impact of the new accounting requirement to expense stock options 
the estimated effective income tax rate is also adjusted for taxes related to significant unusual items 
these actual results could vary from those projected

net cash provided by operating activities was million during the year ended january  and million during the same period a year ago 
the improvement in cash flow was due primarily to the increased number of paying subscribers to our service 
cash provided by operating activities has historically been affected by sales of subscriptions and support and professional services  changes in working capital accounts  particularly increases in accounts receivable and deferred revenue and the timing of commission and bonus payments  and add backs of non cash expense items such as depreciation and amortization and the expense associated with stock based awards 
net cash used in investing activities was million during the year ended january  and million during the same period a year ago  which included the investment of most of the proceeds from our initial public offering in june the net cash used in investing activities during the year ended january  primarily related to the changes in restricted cash balances and marketable securities and capital expenditures associated with the purchase of software licenses  computer equipment and furniture and fixtures as we have expanded our infrastructure and work force 
in february  we obtained additional software licenses for use in our business operations at a cost of million  which included the cost for support for the first year of the license agreement 
additionally  we obtained additional data center capacity and we upgraded our new development and test data center 
for these data center resources  our principal commitments consist of obligations under operating leases for the facilities and computer equipment and contracts for certain services 

table of contents net cash provided by financing activities was million during the year ended january  and million during the same period a year ago 
in june  we completed the sale of million shares of common stock during our initial public offering

during the year ended january   the million of proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and warrants and the  of proceeds from the collection of notes receivable from shareholders were offset by principal payments on capital lease obligations 
as of january   we have a total of million in letters of credit outstanding in favor of our landlords for office space in san francisco  california  switzerland and singapore 
none of these letters of credit are collateralized 
to date  no amounts have been drawn against the letters of credit  which renew annually and mature at various dates through december we do not have any special purpose entities  and other than operating leases for office space and computer equipment  we do not engage in off balance sheet financing arrangements 
additionally  we currently do not have a bank line of credit 
our principal commitments consist of obligations under leases for office space and co location facilities for additional data center capacity and the new development and test data center  and computer equipment and furniture and fixtures 
we also have long term liabilities related primarily to lease abandonments 
at january   the future minimum payments under these commitments as well as our long term liability were as follows payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in thousands capital lease obligations operating lease obligations office space computer equipment and furniture and fixtures contractual commitments lease abandonment liabilities and other our lease agreements provide us with the option to renew 
our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements as we expand our operations 
purchase orders are not included in the table above 
our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
the contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum services to be used  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above 
we believe our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities and cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs over the next months 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our rate of revenue growth  the expansion of our marketing and sales activities  the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts and expansion into new territories  the timing of introductions of new services and enhancements to existing services  the timing of capital expenditures and expenses associated with web hosting and the continuing market acceptance of our services 
to the extent that available funds are insufficient to fund our future activities  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing

while we believe we have sufficient financial resources  we may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing 
additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all 
recent accounting pronouncement in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas r  which requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized as expenses in the statement of operations based on their fair values and vesting periods 
we will adopt the provisions of sfas r on february   which is the start of our next fiscal year 
we believe that the adoption of sfas r will materially reduce our reported results of operations 
the full impact is dependent upon  among other things  the timing of when additional employees that we plan to hire commence employment  the outcome of our current assessment of different long term incentive strategies involving stock awards in order to continue to attract and retain employees  the total number of stock awards granted  the fair value of the stock awards at the time of grant and the tax benefit that we may or may not receive from stock based expenses 
had we adopted sfas r in prior periods  the total stock based expense for all awards before the tax benefit would have approximated the pro forma impact of expensing options as described in note to the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements 
additionally  sfas r requires the tax benefits from employee stock plans to be classified as a financing activity in the consolidated statement of cash flows 
we currently classify these tax benefits as a source of cash provided by operating activities 
these benefits totaled  during the year ended january  and  for the comparable period a year ago 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly changes in the euro  british pound sterling  canadian dollar and japanese yen 
we seek to minimize the impact of certain foreign currency fluctuations by hedging certain balance sheet exposures with foreign currency forward and option contracts 
any gain or loss from settling these contracts is offset by the loss or gain derived from the underlying balance sheet exposures 
the hedging contracts by policy have maturities of less than three months and settle before the end of each quarterly period 
additionally  by policy  we do not enter into any hedging contracts for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate sensitivity we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling million at january  these amounts were invested primarily in money market funds and instruments  corporate notes and bonds  government securities and other debt securities with strong credit ratings 
the cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities are held for working capital purposes 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
our fixed income portfolio is subject to interest rate risk 
an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates of basis points could result in a million market value reduction or increase of the same amount 
this estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur 
fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates gains or losses on the carrying value are recorded in other comprehensive income  and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities 
at january   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling million 
the fixed income portfolio was also subject to interest rate risk 
changes in interest rates of basis points would have resulted in market value changes of million
