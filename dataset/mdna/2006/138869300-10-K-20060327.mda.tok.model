item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our cash and cash equivalents increased million from december  to december   primarily due to two equity financings which resulted in proceeds of million 
these inflows allowed us to absorb negative operating cash flow of million  pay off debentures of million  and the acquisition of properties of million 
we ended the year with million of cash and cash equivalents 
operating losses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the following summary is the significant annual changes in the consolidated statement of operations in compared to revenues decreased by million to million due to ceasing mining activities in april cost of sales decreased by million to million which is in relation to the decrease in revenues due to our lack of mining activities 
depreciation  depletion  and amortization decreased by million due primarily to the impairment of million of mcdonald mineral leases  which was being amortized on a straight line basis 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million due primarily to the spending on the i campaign in an unsuccessful effort to overturn the anti cyanide initiative i exploration costs increased million due primarily to the evaluation of the hycroft property and infill drilling at briggs 
asset retirement obligations decreased by million due primarily to large adjustments to the asset retirement obligations in debenture conversion expense of million was recognized related to the conversion of a portion of the debentures in march revenues continued to decline year over year  due to lower production levels as no new ore was placed on the heap leach pads since april the briggs operation reached the end of its current gold recovery plan with current revenue derived from ore previously placed on the heap leach pad 
revenues of million in declined and from revenue levels in and  respectively 
our lower production levels did not allow us to take full advantage of improving spot gold prices of per ounce in as compared to per ounce in and per ounce in on june   the montana supreme court upheld the anti cyanide initiative  i  affirmed the conclusion of the montana department of natural resources and conservation hearing examiner with respect to termination of our mineral leases with the state of montana  and denied our takings compensation claim 
accordingly  we wrote off our million carrying value for the mcdonald mineral leases during the second quarter of the briggs mine  located in southeastern california  produced  ounces of gold and  ounces of silver  which represents all of our production during briggs is continuing reclamation activities including re contouring  capping  and re vegetation of the non ore piles on the property while reviewing the possible re start on the mine 
the kendall mine  located near lewistown  montana  continued with reclamation and closure activities  principally relating to collection  treatment and disposal of water contained in the process system and mine area  and in re contouring the leach pads and pit areas 
recent development activities included the acquisition and pre feasibility study of the reward property located in southwestern nevada and the acquisition and subsequent joint venture of uranium properties located in east central wyoming 
exploration activities during included infill drilling around the briggs mine and the optioning  evaluation and subsequent release of the hycroft property located in nevada

we currently hold million shares of common stock which represents approximately of the outstanding shares 
critical accounting policies and estimates the ensuing discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us and contained within this annual report on form k 
certain amounts included in or affecting our financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated  requiring that certain assumptions be made with respect to values or conditions which cannot be made with certainty at the time the financial statements are prepared 
therefore  the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and associated disclosures with respect to contingent assets and obligations are necessarily affected by these estimates 
the more significant areas requiring the use of management estimates and assumptions relate to mineral reserves that are the basis for future cash flow estimates and units of production amortization determination  recoverability and timing of gold production from the heap leaching process  environmental  reclamation and closure obligations  asset impairments including estimates of future cash flows  useful lives and residual values of intangible assets  fair value of financial instruments  valuation allowances for deferred tax assets  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following significant assumptions and estimates affect our more critical practices and accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
reserves we have not declared a mineral reserve since year end but reported mineralized material commencing at year end when we have producing mines or are developing a mine we estimate our ore reserves at least on an annual basis 
there are a number of uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of reserves  including many factors beyond our control 
ore reserve estimates are based upon engineering evaluations of assay values derived from samplings of drill holes and other openings 
additionally  declines in the market price of gold may render certain reserves containing relatively lower grades of mineralization uneconomic to mine 
further  availability of permits  changes in operating and capital costs  and other factors could materially and adversely affect ore reserves 
we use our ore reserve estimates in determining the unit basis for mine depreciation and amortization of closure costs 
changes in ore reserve estimates could significantly affect these items 
we produce gold at our briggs mine using the heap leach process 
this process involves the application of cyanide solutions by drip irrigation to ore stacked on an impervious pad 
as the solution percolates through the heap  gold is dissolved from the ore into solution 
this solution is collected and processed with activated carbon  which precipitates the gold out of solution and onto the carbon 
through the subsequent processes of acid washing and pressure stripping  the gold is returned to solution in a more highly concentrated state 
this concentrated solution of gold is then processed in an electrowinning circuit  which re precipitates the gold onto cathodes for melting into gold dor bars 
we must make certain estimates regarding this overall process  the most significant of which are the amount and timing of gold to be recovered 
although we can calculate with reasonable certainty the tonnage and grades of gold ore placed under leach by engineering survey and laboratory analysis of drill hole samples  the recovery and timing factors are influenced by the size of the ore under leach crushed or run of mine and the particular mineralogy of a deposit being mined 
we base our estimates on laboratory leaching models  which approximate the recovery from gold ore under leach on the heap 
from this data  we estimate the amount of gold that can be recovered and the time it will take for recovery 
we continually monitor the actual monthly and cumulative recovery from the heap as a check against the laboratory models  however  ultimate recovery will not be known with certainty until active leaching has stopped and pad rinsing is completed 
because it is impossible to physically measure the exact amount of gold remaining under leach  we calculate  or derive the amount  by 
table of contents taking the difference between the cumulative estimated recoverable gold placed on the heap and the known amount of gold cumulatively produced as dor 
inventories we must capture and classify our inventory related costs to achieve the matching concept of expenses and revenues as required by generally accepted accounting principles 
costs capitalized to inventory relating to the heap leach pad include the direct costs incurred in the mining and crushing of the rock and delivery of the ore onto the heap leach pad  applicable depreciation  depletion and amortization  and allocated indirect mine general and administrative overhead costs 
these costs are relieved from this inventory when gold is produced as dor  and added to all direct costs incurred in the leaching and refining processes  applicable depreciation  depletion and amortization  and allocated indirect mine general and administrative overhead costs for determining the cost of inventory related to dor 
as our estimate of time to recover gold from first being placed under leach to dor production is twelve months  inventory costs are considered a current asset 
the briggs mine stopped loading ore on the heap leach pad in april and we stopped active leaching with cyanide in march recent gold production has occurred during the final rinsing process of the heap leach pad which is expected to last until mid year asset retirement obligations on january   we became subject to the accounting and reporting requirements of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
sfas no 
requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
fair value is determined by estimating the retirement obligations in the period an asset is first placed in service and then adjusting the amount for estimated inflation and market risk contingencies to the projected settlement date of the liability 
the result is then discounted to a present value from the projected settlement date to the date the asset was first placed in service 
the present value of the asset retirement obligation is recorded as an additional property cost and as an asset retirement liability 
the amortization of the additional property cost using the units of production method is included in depreciation  depletion and amortization expense and the accretion of the discounted liability is recorded as a separate operating expense in our statement of operations 
when a mine is shut down and begins the final reclamation we may decide to record the reclamation liability on an undiscounted basis depending on the time frame and materiality of the expenditures 
the asset retirement obligations of the kendall mine and the seven up pete venture are recorded on an undiscounted basis 
impairments we have recorded asset impairments of million  million  and million  during  and  respectively  based on the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  and effective january  we evaluate the carrying value of our producing properties  equipment and mining claims and leases when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the properties may be impaired  but not less than annually 
for producing properties and equipment  an impairment loss is recognized when the estimated future cash flows undiscounted and without interest expected to result from the use of the asset are less than the carrying amount of the asset 
measurement of the impairment loss is based on discounted cash flows 
impairments of mining claims and leases are based on their fair value  which would generally be assessed with reference to comparable property sales transactions in the market place 
derivatives instruments and hedging activities beginning in  the accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities has been guided by sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities and sfas no 
accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities an amendment to sfas no 
that guidance requires entities to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
if certain conditions are met  a derivative may be specifically designated as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment  a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction  or a hedge of the foreign currency exposure 

table of contents during and  we had used derivative financial instruments to manage well defined market risks associated with fluctuating gold prices 
floating rate forward sales contracts were used to manage our exposure to gold prices on a portion of future gold production 
these derivative instruments were not designated as hedges and were recognized as assets or liabilities and marked to market quarterly with changes recorded in earnings 
on settlement of a contract  against which we have delivered gold production  the contract price is recognized as revenue from the gold sale 
if financially settled  the resulting gain or loss is included in revenue if we had sufficient gold production to otherwise settle the contract by delivery 
gains or losses resulting from all other financially settled contracts are recorded as other income expense 
as of december   we did not have any open derivative contracts 
stock based compensation in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which revised sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and superseded accounting principles board apb opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees and its related implementation guidance 
sfas no 
r requires that goods or services received in exchange for share based payments result in a cost that is recognizable in the financial statements  that cost should be recognized in the income statement as an expense when the goods or services are consumed by the enterprise 
we will adopt sfas no 
r on january   using the modified prospective method 
accordingly  compensation expense will be recognized for all awards granted or modified after the effective date 
the nonvested portion of awards will be recognized ratably over the remaining vesting period after the effective date 
the effect on net income from employee stock options issued in or earlier and vesting in is approximately  we currently apply the intrinsic value method in accordance with apb opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations in accounting for employee stock options 
accordingly  because stock option exercise prices equal the market value on the date of grant  no compensation cost is currently recognized for stock option grants 
had compensation cost for the options been recognized based on market value at grant dates as prescribed by sfas no 
r  our net income would have been reduced by   and  for the year ended  and  respectively 
income taxes we must use significant judgment in assessing our ability to generate future taxable income to realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets  which are principally in the form of net operating loss carry forwards and in applying a valuation allowance to all or part of these deferred tax assets using a more likely than not criterion 
potential litigation liabilities we are subject to litigation as the result of our business operations and transactions 
we utilize external counsel in evaluating potential exposure to adverse outcomes from judgments or settlements 
to the extent that actual outcomes differ from our estimates  or additional facts and circumstances cause us to revise our estimates  net income will be affected

in and  cost of sales includes all direct and indirect costs of mining  crushing  processing  and overhead expenses of our production operations 
depreciation  depletion  and amortization was lower in due to the carrying values for the mcdonald undeveloped mineral leases being written down by million in as a result of a june  decision by the montana supreme court canceling the state mineral leases and the reclassification of the seven up pete property from undeveloped mineral claims to mining claims and leases which are reviewed at least annually for impairment and no longer amortized 
there were no property impairments recorded in selling  general  and administration expenses were lower in due to our million contribution during in the funding of the i campaign in montana 
development activities during included the acquisition and pre feasibility study of the reward property located in southwestern nevada and the acquisition and subsequent joint venture of uranium properties located in east central wyoming 
development activities in consisted of preacquisition work on the reward property 
exploration activities during amounted to million and included infill drilling around the briggs mine and the optioning  evaluation and subsequent release of the hycroft property located in nevada  compared to exploration spending of million in which related primarily to holding costs on the seven up pete venture and funding exploration spending for gold resources corporation 
increases in asset retirement obligations resulted in expense of million and million in and  respectively 
the expense in was the result of a combination of completion delays caused by continued gold production from the leach pad  initiation of a drilling program to determine the potential of further mining  addition of reclamation resulting from the repurchase of the briggs crushing plant and higher fuel related costs at the briggs mine totaling million and the establishment of the reclamation of drill holes and roads at the mcdonald gold project totaling million 
in  the briggs mine had decreased availabilities of equipment in the fourth quarter  adverse weather conditions during the fourth quarter abnormal rainfall which hindered access to the mine and slowed haul times for topsoil placement  and engineering changes to topsoil placement roads to provide safer access for haulage and dumping totaling million 
we held discussions with the montana department of environmental quality deq in concerning reclamation at the kendall mine 
the discussion resulted in a modified reclamation plan to include items which had been developed by an engineering contractor to the deq to reflect the anticipated installation of a passive water treatment system 
the changes resulted in an increase of the kendall closure estimate by million 
in march  we induced the conversion to equity of a portion of our outstanding debenture liabilities  which resulted in the recording of million of expense compared to nil in 
table of contents the approximately million warrants that we issued in connection with our december  private placement were determined to be a liability with an initial estimated fair value of million 
at year end  the fair value of warrant liability was estimated to be million and the million decrease in warrant liability was recorded as a gain on derivative instruments 
there was no current or deferred provision for income taxes during or additionally  although we have significant deferred tax assets  principally in the form of operating loss carry forwards  we have recorded a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets in and our costs for fuel increased significantly in compared to which is a significant operating and reclamation expense in we expect high fuel costs and increased costs of hiring and retaining qualified mining personnel with the required specialized skills to operate and manage a mining operation to have a potential significant impact on continuing operations in the future

selling  general  and administration expenses were higher in due to our participation in the funding of the i campaign in montana 
for the twelve months ended december   we contributed million to the i campaign 

table of contents exploration and development costs were lower in due to our primary focus on the i campaign in montana 
during  we determined that certain gold ounces contained in sulfide ores were no longer economic  and as such  decreased the reserves at the briggs mine 
as a consequence  we recorded a write down of million on the mine s long lived assets

however  should we proceed with our plan to reopen the briggs mine  additional financing will be required including equipment purchase and repairs  waste stripping and other development costs 
we do not have the capital resources sufficient to reopen and operate the briggs mine 
in order to do so  we would need to seek funding from outside sources including equity  debt or both

table of contents our gold production has been trending downwards from a high of  ounces in to  ounces in this downward trend is expected to continue during unless we successfully reopen the briggs mine in late or early our long term liquidity will be impacted by the ultimate re start of the briggs mine and successfully producing gold at a profit 
additionally  we are continually evaluating business opportunities such as joint ventures and mergers or acquisitions with the objective of creating additional cash flow to sustain us  provide a future source of funds for growth 
while we believe we will be able to finance our continuing activities  there are no assurances of success in this regard or in our ability to obtain additional financing through capital markets  joint ventures  or other arrangements in the future 
if management s plans are not successful  our ability to operate would be materially adversely impacted

outlook operations the briggs mine placed the last fresh ore on the heap leach pads in april due primarily to lack of mine development 
it is expected that ore on the heap leach pad will be rinsed through may and result in production of approximately  ounces of gold in reclamation of the waste dumps and leach pad began in and will continue through during we expect to spend approximately million on briggs mine reclamation primarily to complete the reclamation of the existing leach pads which will not be used if the mine continues production 
we are currently performing infill drilling between the goldtooth and briggs main pits and have begun initial redevelopment activities at the briggs mine 
it is expected that this data will result in a recalculation of ore reserves 
cost estimates for re start of the operation will be prepared and we expect to finalize a new plan of operations for the briggs mine and processing facilities  utilizing mineralized material at briggs  the satellite cecil r deposit  and the nearby reward deposit

gold prices  price protection arrangements  and associated risks our revenues  earnings and cash flow are strongly influenced by world gold prices  which fluctuate widely and over which we have no control 
our past price protection strategy was to provide an acceptable floor price for a portion of our production in order to meet minimum coverage ratios as required by loan facilities while providing participation in potentially higher prices 
we had no gold related derivatives outstanding as of year end and all gold sold during was sold at spot prices 
the risks associated with price protection arrangements include opportunity risk by limiting unilateral participation in upward prices  production risk associated with the requirement to deliver physical ounces against a forward commitment  and credit risk associated with counterparties to the hedged transaction 
as of december  we were not at risk related to gold related derivative instruments
