item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in addition to historical information  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ substantially from those referred to herein due to a number of factors  including but not limited to risks described in the section entitled risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
our consolidated financial data includes our consolidated subsidiaries 
overview we are an innovative provider of software that enables nonprofit organizations to use the internet to increase donations  reduce fundraising costs  improve operations and build awareness and affinity for their causes by bringing employees  volunteers and donors together in online  interactive communities 
our flagship product  kintera sphere  is managed as a single system and offered to nonprofit organizations as a service accessed with a web browser 
nonprofit organizations pay kintera service fees for access to kintera sphere and transaction based fees tied to the donations and purchases 
although our revenues have increased substantially on a year over year basis  we have experienced significant net losses and negative cash flows from operations in each fiscal period since inception  and as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
since inception  we have significantly increased our revenues through a combination of factors  including i obtaining new customers  ii expanding existing customer relationships  iii acquiring complementary businesses  iv expanding the features of kintera sphere  v increasing the number and amount of donations we process that result in transaction based fees and vi offering new and improved products and services 
sources of revenue we generate the majority of our revenue from arrangements with nonprofit organizations related to their use of kintera sphere to manage their websites  special events and membership  organize individuals  advocate causes  perform wealth screening  raise major gifts  deliver services and programs and execute personalized marketing campaigns 
we primarily enter into customer contracts for kintera sphere that are one year or more in duration 
our customers pay us upfront fees and monthly service fees for access to kintera sphere  and transaction based fees tied to the donations and purchases we process 
revenues from upfront service fees are deferred and recognized as revenue over the entire term of our contracts 
revenues from transaction processing fees are recognized as they are earned  and we have experienced significant growth with our total online donations processed increasing from million in to million in to million in and million in revenue from service plan and maintenance associated with kintera sphere represented approximately  and of our total net revenue in  and  respectively 
revenue from data and support services represented approximately  and of our total net revenue in  and  respectively 
we also enter into service contracts and implementation contracts related to kintera sphere that are months or longer in duration 
we also generate revenues from our wealth profiling business  which provides a prospect screening tool designed for the fundraising community to find  profile  monitor and dynamically rank the wealth in a nonprofit organization s prospect database 
wealth profiling services are sold in connection with kintera sphere as well as on a stand alone basis 
revenues from the wealth profiling business arise from primarily three sources kintera sphere access or software licensing  post contract support services of the software licenses  and consulting services and related data processing fees 
our awareness campaign business specializes in melding offline and online strategies and tools to build membership  affinity and impact for nonprofit organizations  political campaigns and unions 
we recognize revenue from the awareness campaign business from primarily four sources kintera sphere access or software licensing  website development and customization  messaging services email fax  and consulting services 

table of contents software licenses are sold together with consulting services in our wealth profiling and awareness campaign products 
revenue allocated to the service element is recognized as the services are performed 
if performance is not apparent  service revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the period during which the services are performed unless the license has not been delivered  in which case the revenue is deferred until the license is delivered 
we also generate a significant amount of revenue through our fundware business  which we acquired from intuit in december for million in cash 
revenues from this operation are derived from perpetual license fees for the fundware accounting software package  as well as related product support  professional services  outsourced payroll services and transaction fees 
the demand for our services has been affected in the past  and may continue to be affected in the future  by various factors  including but not limited to  the following economic conditions  the timing or cancellation of significant clients world events  and seasonality 
for these and other reasons  our net revenue and results of operations in and prior periods may not necessarily be indicative of future net revenue and results of operations 
see item a of this annual report for more discussion of factors that could affect our operating results 
our top ten customers generated an aggregate of of our total net revenue for the year ended december  no customer generated greater than of total net revenue in either or  and one customer generated greater then of net revenue in cost of revenues and operating expenses cost of revenues 
cost of revenue includes salaries  benefits and related expenses of operations and database support and implementation and support services  as well as data costs and amortization of software 
gross profit represents net revenue less the costs of revenue for personnel engaged in database support 
gross profit percentage is highly dependent on contract agreements  donation volume and overhead allocations 
we do not believe that historical gross profit margins are a reliable indicator of future gross profit margins 
as our service and support costs continue to rise due to increased the increase in services activity relative to our other produce lines  we anticipate that our overall gross margin will decrease 
in  we intend to implement a new project accounting module that will better track and record costs associated with each product line and customer 
we anticipate this will improve our visibility into the factors that cause margin fluctuations and our ability to achieve consistent  sustainable gross margins for each of our major revenue sources 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions  benefits and related expenses of personnel engaged in selling  marketing and customer support functions  as well as public relations  advertising and promotional costs 
sales and marketing expenses do not include stock based compensation allocable to personnel performing sales and marketing activities 
product development and support expenses 
product development and support expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs of employees engaged in engineering  development and quality assurance activities  subcontracting costs and facilities expenses 
product development and support expenses do not include amounts associated with stock based compensation expense for employees engaged in the product development and support activities 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel related expenses  depreciation  legal and other professional fees  facilities and communication expenses and information technology expenditures 
amounts associated with stock based compensation expense for employees 
table of contents engaged in the general and administrative department are shown separately 
during  we incurred a significant amount of outside consultant costs and audit fees to comply with the provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of relating to management s assessment of internal control over financial reporting 
amortization of purchased intangibles expense 
amortization of purchased intangibles expense excluding amortization of software recorded in cost of revenue consists of costs associated with the acquired intangibles such as contact list  customer files  etc 
that are expensed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of five years 
in previous quarters these amounts were recorded in sales and marketing  product development and support and general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
management believes that reporting amortization of purchased intangibles expenses as a distinct reporting category provides better and more complete disclosure regarding the associated expense 
comparative figures for the years ended december  and have been reclassified to conform to the current period s presentation 
deferred stock based compensation expenses 
in connection with the grant of stock options to employees  consultants and in connection with acquisitions during the years ended december  and  we recorded  and million in deferred stock based compensation within stockholders equity  respectively 
these options were considered compensatory because the deemed fair value of the underlying common stock for financial reporting purposes was greater than the exercise prices determined by the board of directors on the date of grant 
the determination of the fair value prior to our initial public offering of the underlying shares of common stock involves subjective judgment and the consideration of a variety of factors  including the prices obtained in private placement transactions of other equity securities  and as a result the amount of the compensatory charge is not based on an objective measure such as the trading price of the common stock since there was no public market for our common stock prior to december  as of december   we had an aggregate of million of deferred stock based compensation remaining to be amortized 
effective january   we will adopt the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  using the modified prospective transition method 
under that transition method  compensation expense that we recognize beginning on that date will include a compensation expense for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of  january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
 and b compensation expense for all share based payments granted on or after january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
results for prior periods will not be restated 
at december   there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non vested share based compensation arrangements granted under all equity compensation plans 
we estimate the fair value of options granted using the black scholes option valuation model and the assumptions shown in note to the financial statements 
we estimate the expected term of options granted based on the history of grants and exercises in our option database 
we estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on both the historical volatility as well as the implied volatility of publicly traded options on our common stock  consistent with sfas no 
r and securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
we base the risk free interest rate that we use in the black scholes option valuation model on the implied yield in effect at the time of option grant on us treasury zero coupon issues with equivalent remaining terms 
we have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
consequently  we use an expected dividend yield of zero in the black scholes option valuation model 
we amortize the fair value ratably over the vesting period of the awards  which is typically four years 
we may elect to use different assumptions under the black scholes option valuation model in the future or select a different option valuation model altogether  which could materially affect our net income or loss and net income or loss per share in the future 

table of contents acquisitions acquisitions have been an important part of our development to date 
these acquisitions enabled us to expand our service offerings to include wealth profiling and screening services  directed giving programs  accounting software  online grants  consulting and advocacy services 
we may continue to acquire companies that provide us with proprietary technology  access to key accounts  or personnel with significant experience in the nonprofit industry 
during  we completed acquisitions of several complementary businesses including prospect information network pin  carol trevelyan strategy group ctsg  bnw  inc  kindmark  kamtech  inc  giving capital  inc and american fundware  inc 
fundware  and in  we completed the acquisition of gold box  inc gold box 
from time to time  in connection with business acquisitions  we agree to make additional future payments to sellers contingent upon achievement of specific performance based milestones by the acquired entities 
pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
 such amounts are accrued  and therefore  recorded by us as liabilities when the contingency is probable and estimatable and  hence  the additional consideration becomes payable 
in february  we completed the acquisition of pin  which is now part of our wealth screening business 
we issued approximately  shares of restricted common stock subject to vesting ratably over a period of months 
up to  additional shares of common stock were being held in escrow and could be released to the members of pin if the revenue generated from pin s business during the year following the closing of the transaction meets certain targets 
in addition  some of the shares issued to the pin members are being held in escrow to secure the obligations of pin and its members under the purchase agreement 
in the third quarter of  we released  shares of common stock  formerly held in escrow  to the former shareholders of pin upon the achievement of revenue targets 
as a result of the release  we recorded additional goodwill of approximately million 
in march  we completed the acquisition of ctsg  which is now a part of our advocacy business 
we issued approximately  shares of restricted common stock and  in cash to acquire ctsg 
up to  additional shares of common stock are being held in escrow and will be released if the revenue generated from ctsg s business during the year following the closing of the transaction meets certain targets 
in addition  some of the shares issued are being held in escrow to secure the obligations of ctsg and its stockholders 
in april  we released and accelerated vesting on  shares of common stock  formerly held in escrow  to the former ctsg shareholders 
as a result of such vesting  we realized a stock compensation charge of approximately million during the year ended december  in the event that the sum of the gross proceeds from the sale of all shares sold by the former ctsg stockholders prior to march   plus the total value of the unsold shares is less than an aggregate of million such difference  the pro rata shortfall  then we are obligated to pay the former ctsg stockholders an amount equal to the pro rata shortfall 
as of december   we recognized approximately  in compensation expense related to the estimated pro rata shortfall 
in december  we completed the acquisition of fundware  provider of accounting software for nonprofit organizations and governments 
we paid million in cash to acquire all of the outstanding shares of fundware 
in february  we completed the acquisition of gold box  a business which allows an individual to create a personalized charity gift card or gift certificate 
we issued approximately  shares of restricted common stock and paid approximately  in cash 
the approximately  shares of restricted common stock are being held in escrow and may be released to the stockholders of gold box if the revenue generated from gold box s business during the year following the closing meets certain targets 

table of contents business enterprise segments we operate in one reportable operating segment software and service provider to not for profit organizations 
sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  or sfas  establishes standards for the way public business enterprises report information about operating segments in annual consolidated financial statements and requires that those enterprises report selected information about operating segments in interim financial reports 
sfas also establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services  geographic areas and major customers 
although we had two operating segments at december   under the aggregation criteria set forth in sfas we operate in only one reportable operating segment software and service provider to not for profit organizations 
under sfas  two or more operating segments may be aggregated into a single operating segment for financial reporting purposes if aggregation is consistent with the objective and basic principles of sfas  if the segments have similar economic characteristics  and if the segments are similar in each of the following areas the nature of the product and services  the nature of the production processes  the type or class of customers for their products and services  and the method used to distribute their products or provide their services 
we meet each of the aggregation criteria for the following reasons our software solutions are designed to address the needs of non profit organizations  we offer the same support and consulting service agreements to all customers  and the market in which our operating segments target are the same non profit organizations 
our operating segments share similar economic characteristics as they have a similar long term business model  operate at similar gross margins  and have similar selling  general and administrative expenses 
the causes for variation among each of our operating segments are the same and include factors such as i number of competitors  ii term of the license or service agreement  iii product differentiation and iv size of market opportunity 
additionally  each operating segment is subject to the overall nature of the non profit industry 
because we meet each of the criteria set forth in sfas and our operating segments as of december  share similar economic characteristics  and how management internally evaluates separate financial information  business activities and management responsibility  we aggregate our results of operations into one operating segment 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liability at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenue and expenses in the reporting period 
we regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions related to allowances for doubtful accounts  stock based compensation expense  goodwill and purchased intangible asset valuation  software development costs and litigation and other loss contingencies 
we base our estimates and assumptions on current facts  historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the actual results experienced by us may differ materially and adversely from our estimates 
to the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results  our future results of operations will be affected 

table of contents we consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment allowance for doubtful accounts  revenue recognition  accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets  accounting for software development costs  and accounting for stock based compensation 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability  failure or refusal of our clients to make required payments 
we analyze accounts receivable  historical percentages of uncollectible accounts and changes in payment history when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we use an internal collection effort  which may include our sales and services groups as we deem appropriate  in our collection efforts 
although we believe that our reserves are adequate  if the financial condition of our clients deteriorates  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  or if we underestimate the allowances required  additional allowances may be necessary  which will result in increased expense in the period in which such determination is made 
revenue recognition 
we derive revenues from fees paid by nonprofit organizations related to their use of kintera sphere as well as from our services offerings for wealth profiling and screening  advocacy campaigns and directed giving  from licenses of our prepackaged accounting software and from multiple element arrangements that may include any combination of these items 
for arrangements with multiple elements  we allocate revenues to each element of the transaction based upon its fair value 
fair value for all elements of an arrangement is determined when the delivered items have value to the customer on a stand alone basis  evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items exists based on the price of regular sales on a stand alone basis  and delivery or performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially in our control 
items are considered to have stand alone value if we have sold that item separately on a regular basis in the past 
when the fair value of a delivered element has not been established or we are unable to establish stand alone value  as currently is the case for the upfront payments for activation  maintenance  and use of kintera sphere  the revenues for the elements are recognized on a straight line basis over the entire term of the contract 
to date  our arrangements that contain multiple elements have been contracts that include upfront payments for activation  fees received for data screening arrangements  monthly fees for the maintenance and use of our software and transaction fees tied to the donations and purchases that we process 
revenue associated with the upfront payments is deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the entire term of the contract which in general ranges from twelve to thirty six months 
revenue related to monthly maintenance and transaction fees for donations made through the website are recognized as services are provided 
credit card fees directly associated with processing customer donations and billed to customers are excluded from revenues in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf consensus on issue reporting revenue gross as a principal verses net as an agent 
we recognize revenues related to kintera sphere and other non software licensed products for upfront fees  monthly maintenance fees  consulting services  data screening  and transaction fees tied to the donations and purchases that we process 
we recognize revenues when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists upon contract signing or receipt of an authorized purchase order from the customer  delivery has occurred upon performance of services in accordance with contract specifications  customer payment is deemed fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties credit terms extending beyond twelve months or significantly longer than is customary are deemed not to be fixed and determinable  and collection is reasonably assured there are no indicators of non payment based upon history with the customer and or upon completion of credit procedures  if completed 
billings made or payments received in advance of providing services are deferred until the period these services are provided 

table of contents we recognize revenue from software licenses and related services in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  or sop   software revenue recognition  as modified by sop for other offerings  we follow staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been shipped or the service has been performed or  in the case of certain agreements  when the products are delivered to resellers  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
consulting services are recognized separately from the software license and database as well as post contract support as they have value to the customer on a stand alone basis and there is a vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value for each of the remaining deliverables 
vsoe of fair value is based on the normal pricing practices for those products and services when sold separately by the company and customer renewal rates for post contract support services if evidence of the fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist  the revenue is deferred and recognized when delivery of those elements occurs or when fair value can be established 
we offer technical support plans and recognize support revenue over the life of the plan 
for arrangements where undelivered services are essential to the functionality of delivered software  we recognize both the product license revenues and service revenues under the percentage of completion contract method in accordance with the provisions of sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
to date  license and service revenues recognized pursuant to sop have not been significant 
in accordance with the financial accounting standard board s emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer or a reseller of the vendor s product  we account for cash consideration such as sales incentives that is given to customers or resellers as a reduction of revenue rather than as an operating expense unless we receive a benefit that can be identified and for which the fair value can be reasonably estimated 
software licenses are sold together with consulting services in our wealth profiling  advocacy campaign businesses and fundware software products 
when this occurs  license fees are recognized upon delivery provided that the revenue recognition criteria discussed above are met 
the more significant factors considered in determining whether revenues should be accounted for separately include nature of the services ie consideration whether services are essential to the functionality of the licensed product  degree of risk  availability of services from other vendors  timing of payments and impact of milestones or acceptance criteria on the realizability of the software license fee 
payment of the license fees is not dependent upon the performance of the services  and the services do not provide significant customization or modification of the software products and are not essential to the functionality of the software that was delivered 
for arrangements with services that are essential to the functionality of the software  the license and related service revenues are recognized upon completion of the delivery of the license and the services with the residual method utilized for the remaining elements in the contract 
if at the outset of an arrangement we determine that the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable  revenue is deferred until the arrangement fee becomes due 
if at the outset of an arrangement we determine that collectibility is not probable  revenue is deferred until the earlier of when collectibility becomes probable or the receipt of payment 
revenues from post contract customer support services  such as software maintenance  are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the support period 
the majority of software maintenance agreements provide technical support as well as unspecified software product upgrades and releases when and if made available during the term of the support period 
we enter into transactions that either exchange advertising for advertising advertising barter or advertising for other products and services non advertising barter 
advertising barter transactions are recorded at the lesser of estimated fair value of the advertising received or given in accordance with the provisions of eitf issue no 
 accounting for barter transactions 
revenue from barter transactions is recognized when advertising is provided  and services received are charged to expense when used 
revenues for non advertising barter transactions are recognized at the estimated fair value when the advertising spots received 
table of contents under such contracts are either used or sold to third parties 
during the years ended december   and  the company recognized  million and  respectively  of revenue in connection with advertising 
accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill and other intangible assets require us to make determinations about the value and recoverability of those assets that involve estimates and judgments 
we have made several acquisitions of businesses and assets that resulted in both goodwill and intangible assets being recorded in our financial statements 
we have typically paid most of the acquisition prices in these transactions through the issuance of equity securities 
the value of the equity securities prior to our initial public offering in december was determined through comparison to the issuance prices received in private placement transactions 
goodwill is recorded as the difference  if any  between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
the amounts and useful lives assigned to other intangible assets impact the amount and timing of future amortization  and the amount assigned to in process research and development is expensed immediately 
the value of our intangible assets  including goodwill  could be impacted by future adverse changes such as i any future declines in our operating results  ii a decline in the valuation of technology company stocks  including the valuation of our common stock  iii any failure to meet the performance projections included in our forecasts of future operating results 
we evaluate goodwill and other purchased intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives  on an annual basis in the fourth quarter or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units  assigning goodwill to reporting units and determining the fair value of each reporting unit 
in fiscal  in accordance with sfas no 
 management determined that there was only one reporting unit to be tested 
the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit with the carrying value of the reporting unit 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as in a business combination 
determining the fair value of the implied goodwill is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge 
estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows and market comparisons 
these approaches use significant estimates and assumptions  including projection and timing of future cash flows  discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows  perpetual growth rates  determination of appropriate market comparables  and determination of whether a premium or discount should be applied to comparables 
it is reasonably possible that the plans and estimates used to value these assets may be incorrect 
if our actual results  or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analyses  are lower than the original estimates used to assess the recoverability of these assets  we could incur additional impairment charges 
for fiscal  the discounted cash flows for the reporting unit was based on discrete two year financial forecasts developed by management for planning purposes 
cash flows beyond the two year discrete forecasts were estimated using terminal value calculations 
the median five year compounded annual growth rate of earnings is during the discrete forecast period and the future cash flows were discounted to present value using a discount rate of and residual growth rates of 
we did not recognize any goodwill impairment as a result of performing this annual test 
a variance in the discount rate or the estimated revenue growth rate could have a significant impact on the estimated fair value of the reporting unit and consequently the amount of identified goodwill impairment 
we also assess the impairment of our long lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset s carrying value may not be recoverable 
an impairment charge is recognized when the sum of the expected future undiscounted net cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset 
an impairment charge would be measured by comparing the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset being evaluated for impairment 
any resulting impairment charge could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 

table of contents accounting for software development costs 
we account for internal use software development costs in accordance with sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
sop in accordance with sop  costs to develop internal use computer software during the application development stage are capitalized 
internal use capitalized software costs are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related software applications of up to three years and are included in depreciation and amortization

amortization of purchased intangibles 
amortization of purchased intangibles expense increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended and  for the year ended the increase of million can be attributed to the amortization for acquired intangible assets and the amortization of our capitalized software 
the increase of million is also related to the amortization for intangible asset from the acquisitions 
stock based compensation expenses 
the stock based compensation expense recorded represents amortization of deferred compensation resulting from the issuance of employees pre ipo options and restricted stock units to employees and unvested equity compensation instruments assumed in acquisitions 
deferred compensation is presented as a reduction of shareholders equity and is amortized ratably over the respective vesting periods of the applicable unvested securities  approximately four years 
during  we recorded approximately  of deferred compensation primarily resulting from the stock options granted to employees in excess of the reserve authorized by stockholders 
all grants were authorized effective as of july  this deferred compensation is being amortized ratably over the vesting period of the underlying stock options of four years 
in addition  in april  we released and accelerated vesting on  shares of 
table of contents common stock  formerly held in escrow  to the former ctsg shareholders upon the fulfillment of certain milestones 
as a result of such vesting  we realized a stock compensation charge of approximately million during the year ended december  in the event that the sum of the gross proceeds from the sale of all shares sold by the former ctsg stockholders prior to march   plus the total value of the unsold shares is less than an aggregate of million such difference  the pro rata shortfall  then we are obligated to pay the former ctsg stockholders an amount equal to the pro rata shortfall 
as of december   we recognized an additional  in compensation expense related to the estimated pro rata shortfall 
in december  we executed a stock option repricing program which resulted in the repricing of certain employee stock options and the acceleration of vesting for certain other employee stock options 
an aggregate of  vested stock options with exercise prices greater than were repriced to the then current market of and vesting was accelerated on  options 
we recorded  as compensation expense relating to the repricing of stock options for the difference between the effective date stock prices of and the market price on december  of 
the value on the  re priced stock options as of december  was determined to be million liquidity and capital resources we have historically funded our operations principally through sales of equity securities 
in december  we completed our initial public offering and received net proceeds of million

cash flows operating activities our net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  for the year ended december   the increased net loss was the primary reason for the increased cash used in operating activities 
the fiscal year net loss of million included certain non cash expenses totaling million  including million for bad debt expense  million in depreciation and amortization   for amortization of premium on securities   in options granted for compensation and million of amortization of deferred compensation 
in addition  in  cash used in operating activities included an increase of million in accounts receivable  a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million offset in part by a  decrease in prepaid expenses  an increase of million in accrued employee benefits  an increase of million in donations payable and an increase of million for deferred revenue 
at december   we had working capital of million  compared to working capital of million at december  this decrease was primarily a result of by cash used in operating activities partially offset by the financings described above 
at december   we had trade accounts receivable of million 
this compares to million in trade accounts receivable at december  the level of trade accounts receivable at december  represented approximately days of revenues 
terms with individual customers vary greatly 
we typically require thirty day terms from our customers 
our receivables can vary dramatically due to overall sales volumes and due to quarterly variations in donations processed and timing of implementation of services and receipts from large customers and the timing of contract payments

financing activities during the fiscal years ended december   and  we financed our working capital requirements primarily through the sale of common and preferred stock  the exercise of stock options and from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan

if we are unable to increase our revenues and substantially decrease our expenses  we will need to raise additional funds to finance our future capital needs 
we may need additional financing earlier than we anticipate 
if we raise additional funds through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  these transactions may dilute the value of our outstanding common stock 
we may also decide to issue securities  including debt securities  which have rights  preferences and privileges senior to our common stock 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise additional funds on terms favorable to us or at all 
if future financing is not available or is not available on acceptable terms  we may not be able to fund our future needs 
this may prevent us from increasing our market share  capitalizing on new business opportunities or remaining competitive in our industry 
we currently do not believe we have any variable interest entities 
we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
we are  therefore  not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements  financings or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons

r share based payment  amending sfas no 
 effective beginning our first quarter of fiscal sfas r requires the company to expense stock options based on grant date fair value in its financial statements 
further  the sfas r requires additional accounting related to the income tax effects and additional disclosure regarding the cash flow effects resulting from share based payment arrangements 
in march  the us securities and exchange commission the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 which expresses views of the sec staff regarding the interaction between sfas r and certain sec rules and regulations  and provides the staff s views regarding the valuation of share based payment arrangements for public companies 
the company is considering the guidance of this sab in the adoption of sfas r 
the effect of expensing stock options on results of operations using a black scholes option pricing model is presented in these financial statements above under stock based compensation 
under sfas r  we must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at date of adoption 
the transition methods include prospective and retroactive adoption options 
we expect to utilize the prospective method which requires that compensation expense begin being recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas r 
we are evaluating the requirements of sfas r and expect the adoption of sfas r will have a material impact on results of operations and earnings loss per share 
we have not determined whether the adoption will result in amounts similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings  types and maturities 
we do not use derivative financial instruments 
we place our cash investments in institutions that meet high credit quality standards 
our cash and cash equivalents are not subject to significant interest risks due to the short maturities of these instruments 
as of december   the carrying value of our cash and cash equivalents approximated fair value 
due to the nature of our short term investments  we have concluded that there is no material market risk exposure 
therefore  no quantitative tabular disclosures are required
