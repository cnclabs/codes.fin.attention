recent accounting standards in december  the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa issued statement of position sop  accounting for certain loans or debt securities acquired in a transfer 
this sop addresses accounting for differences between contractual cash flows and cash flows expected to be collected from an investor s initial investment in loans or debt securities loans acquired in a transfer if those differences are attributable  at least in part  to credit quality 
it includes such loans acquired in purchase business combinations and applies to all nongovernmental entities  including not for profit organizations 
this sop does not apply to loans originated by the entity 
this sop limits the yield that may be accreted accretable yield to the excess of the investor s estimate of undiscounted expected principal  interest  and other cash flows cash flows expected at acquisition to be collected over the investor s initial investment in the loan 
this sop requires that the excess of contractual cash flows over cash flows expected to be collected nonaccretable difference not be recognized as an adjustment of yield  loss accrual  or valuation allowance 
this sop prohibits investors from displaying accretable yield and nonaccretable difference in the balance sheet 
subsequent increases in cash flows expected to be collected generally should be recognized prospectively through adjustment of the loan s yield over its remaining life 
decreases in cash flows expected to be collected should be recognized as impairment 
this sop prohibits carrying over or creation of valuation allowances in the initial accounting of all loans acquired in a transfer that are within the scope of this sop 
the prohibition of the valuation allowance carryover applies to the purchase of an individual loan  a pool of loans  a group of loans and loans acquired in a purchase business combination 
this sop is effective for loans acquired in fiscal years beginning after december  the changes required by this sop have not had and are not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
with respect to the acquisitions of union bank and fflc bancorp  there were a diminimus number of loans which fell within the scope of this sop 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas r  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas r supersedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas  statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas r is similar to the approach described in sfas however  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
sfas r was originally effective for interim or annual periods beginning after june  however  in april the securities and exchange commission sec amended this requirement allowing companies to adopt the standard at the beginning of their next fiscal year that begins after june  early adoption will be permitted in periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued 
sfas r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the effective date 
a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
the company adopted sfas r effective january  using the modified prospective method 
as permitted by sfas  through the end of  the company accounted for share based payments to employees using opinion s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognized no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas r s fair value method will have an impact on the company s results of operations  although it is not expected to have a material impact on its overall financial position 
the impact of adopting sfas r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had the company adopted sfas r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share included in the stock based compensation section of note  summary of significant accounting and reporting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in march  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 share based payment  which provides interpretive guidance on various issues in sfas r  particularly valuation methodologies and the selection of assumptions 
this sab also discusses the sec staff s expectations regarding disclosures in management s discussion and analysis related to share based payment transactions  as well as the interaction of sfas r with existing sec guidance  such as that dealing with disclosure of non gaap financial measures 
in may  the fasb issued sfas  accounting changes and error corrections  which replaces opinion  accounting changes  and sfas  reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements an amendment of apb opinion no 
sfas changes the requirements for the accounting and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
it applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle as well as to changes required by an accounting pronouncement that does not include specific transition provisions 
sfas eliminates the requirement in opinion to include the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principle in the income statement in the period of change 
instead  to enhance the comparability of prior period financial statements  sfas requires that changes in accounting principle be retrospectively applied 
under retrospective application  the new accounting principle is applied as of the beginning of the first period presented as if that principle had always been used 
the cumulative effect of the change is reflected in the carrying value of assets and liabilities as of the first period presented and the offsetting adjustments are recorded to opening retained earnings 
each period presented is adjusted to reflect the period specific effects of applying the change 
although retrospective application is similar to restating prior periods  sfas gives the treatment a new name to differentiate it from restatement for the correction of an error 
only direct effects of the change will be included in the retrospective application  all indirect effects will be recognized in the period of change 
if it is impracticable to determine the cumulative effect for all prior periods  the new accounting principle should be applied as if it were adopted prospectively from the earliest date practicable 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  the changes required by sfas are not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
the fsp addresses the determination as to when an investment is considered impaired  whether that impairment is other than temporary  and the measurement of an impairment loss 
the fsp also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other than temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other than temporary impairments 
the guidance in this fsp amends sfas  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securitie and opinion  the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock 
fsp replaces the impairment evaluation guidance paragraphs of emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  with references to the existing other than temporary impairment guidance 
eitf s disclosure requirements remain in effect  and are applicable for year end reporting and for interim periods if there are significant changes from the previous year end 
the fsp also supersedes eitf topic no 
d  recognition of other than temporary impairment upon the planned sale of a security whose cost exceeds fair value  and clarifies that an investor should recognize an impairment loss no later than when the impairment is deemed other than temporary  even if a decision to sell an impaired security has not been made 
the guidance in this fsp is to be applied to reporting periods beginning after december  the changes required by fsp are not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued fsp sop  terms of loan products that may give rise to a concentration of credit risk 
the fsp clarifies that loan products that expose an originator  holder  investor  guarantor  or servicer to an increased risk of nonpayment or not realizing the full value of the loan ie nontraditional loan products may result in a concentration of credit risk  as defined in sfas  disclosures about fair value of financial instruments 
the fsp is effective immediately 
the fsp also codifies the existing disclosure requirements for nontraditional loan products 
no effective date or transition guidance was provided for this portion of the fsp as it only references existing accounting literature 
the company does not have a material amount of nontraditional loan products whose terms represent a concentration of credit risk  therefore  this fsp did not have any impact on the company 
critical accounting policies bancgroup s significant accounting policies are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the other footnotes  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
those accounting policies involving significant estimates and assumptions by management  which have  or could have  a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and impact comprehensive income  are considered critical accounting policies 
bancgroup recognizes the following as critical accounting policies allowance for loan losses  purchase accounting and goodwill  income taxes and consolidations 
allowance for loan losses management s ongoing evaluation of the adequacy and allocation of the allowance considers both impaired and unimpaired loans and takes into consideration the bank s past loan loss experience  known and inherent risks in the portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrowers ability to repay  estimated value of any underlying collateral and an analysis of current economic conditions 
while management believes that it has exercised prudent judgment and applied reasonable assumptions which have resulted in an allowance presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  there can be no assurance that in the future adverse economic conditions  increased nonperforming loans or other factors will not require further increases in  or re allocation of  the allowance 
a more detailed discussion of bancgroup s allowance for loan losses is included in the risk management section and note to the consolidated financial statements 
the table below illustrates bancgroup s sensitivity to changes in certain factors used in the determination of the allowance for loan losses 
estimated effect on provision expense assuming the following changes in each determining factor factors in thousands loan portfolio size net charge offs criticized loans criticized loans include all loans rated special mention or worse includes all nonperforming assets and severely past due loans 
these computations do not contemplate any action bancgroup could undertake in response to changes in each of these risk factors 
purchase accounting and goodwill bancgroup s mergers and acquisitions are accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
under the purchase method  the company is required to record the assets acquired  including identified intangible assets  and liabilities assumed at their fair value  which often involves estimates based on third party valuations  such as appraisals  or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques  which are inherently subjective 
the amortization of identifiable intangible assets is based upon the estimated economic benefits to be received  which is also subjective 
these estimates also include the establishment of various accruals and allowances based on planned facility dispositions and employee severance considerations  as well as other acquistion related items 
the purchase method requires the company to record goodwill in an amount equal to the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
bancgroup tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  or more often if events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment 
the company has elected to perform its annual testing as of september each year 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process  which requires management to make judgments in determining the assumptions used in the calculations 
the first step involves estimating the fair value of each reporting unit and comparing it to the reporting unit s carrying value  which includes the allocated goodwill 
if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value  then a second step is performed to measure the actual amount of goodwill impairment 
the second step initially involves determining the implied fair value of goodwill 
this requires the company to allocate the estimated fair value to all the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
any unallocated fair value represents the implied fair value of goodwill which is compared to its corresponding carrying value 
if the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
fair values of reporting units were estimated using discounted cash flow models derived from internal earnings forecasts 
the key assumptions used to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit included earnings forecasts for five years  terminal values based on future growth rates and discount rates based on the company s weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the risks associated with the operations of each reporting unit 
the goodwill impairment analysis for indicated that no impairment write offs were required 
the table below illustrates bancgroup s sensitivity to changes in the rates used in discounting the estimated future cash flows 
the sensitivity analysis was based on information available as of the annual test date of september  further discussion regarding bancgroup s accounting for goodwill is included at note to the consolidated financial statements 
sensitivity of goodwill impairment analysis results assuming the following changes in discount rates no change in thousands total excess of estimated fair value versus carrying value for all reporting units these computations do not take into account changes in the forecasted cash flows and future annual growth rates 
further  the computations do not contemplate any action bancgroup could undertake in response to changes in the risks associated with the operations of each reporting unit 
income taxes bancgroup uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
determination of the deferred and current provision requires analysis by management of certain transactions and the related tax laws and regulations 
management exercises significant judgment in evaluating the amount and timing of recognition of the resulting tax liabilities and assets 
those judgments and estimates are re evaluated on a continual basis as regulatory and business factors change 
consolidations the company enters into a variety of financing and investing arrangements in the normal course of business 
financing arrangements are entered into to meet balance sheet management  funding  liquidity and market or credit risk management needs 
investing arrangements are entered into in order to earn a return on investment 
because certain financing arrangements are made through legal entities and certain investments are in separate legal entities  the company must evaluate whether or not these entities should be consolidated into the company for financial reporting 
in determining whether the entities involved in these arrangements should be consolidated  the company first considers the guidance in accounting research bulletin  consolidated financial statements  which requires a company s consolidated financial statements to include subsidiaries in which the company has a controlling financial interest 
this requirement is usually applied to subsidiaries in which a company has a majority voting interest 
however  for entities that are not controllable through voting interests or in which the equity investors do not bear the residual economic risks  the company follows the guidance in financial accounting standards board interpretation fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities 
determining whether a variable interest entity vie should be consolidated requires the company to make estimates about the vie s expected losses and expected residual returns  as well as the extent to which those expected losses and expected residual returns will be absorbed by the company 
if the company absorbs a majority of either  it is considered the primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate the vie 
review of results of operations colonial reported record net income of million for the year ended  a increase over the company also earned record earnings per diluted share of for the year ended  a increase over net interest income net interest income represents the difference  or spread  between interest and fee income generated from earning assets and the interest expense paid on deposits and borrowed funds 
interest rate volatility  which impacts the volume and mix of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as well as their rates  can significantly impact net interest income 
the net interest margin is net interest income expressed as a percentage of average earning assets for the period being measured

average interest earning assets average interest earning assets grew billion or in the average yield on earning assets increased basis points in primarily due to interest rate increases in loans and loans held for sale 
during  the federal reserve continued raising interest rates resulting in a basis point increase to the target federal funds rate 
the company raised its prime rate in conjunction with those increases 
approximately of the company s loan portfolio is variable or adjustable rate and therefore is directly impacted by changes in market rates 
the composition of the earning asset growth is detailed in the sections below

the average yield in mortgage warehouse loans increased to in compared to in the pricing of these loans is affected by changes in market rates and customer demand 
loans held for sale 
loans held for sale represent single family residential mortgage loans either directly originated  or acquired as short term participations in mortgage loans 
it is the company s policy to enter into forward sales commitments at the same time these mortgage loans are originated or acquired 
the largest portion of loans held for sale are participations originated by the mortgage warehouse lending division 
interests in these participations were also sold to third party commercial paper conduits in average loans held for sale increased million to million in from million in the average yield on the company s loans held for sale increased basis points to in versus in securities 
on average  the securities portfolio increased approximately million in to billion

in the first half of  the company bought million in new securities at a weighted average yield of 
during the remainder of  the company sold or designated its intent to sell approximately billion in securities incurring net losses of million 
proceeds from approximately million were used to extinguish borrowings 
another million of the securities sold had a weighted average yield of and were reinvested into securities having a weighted average yield of 
the remaining million in securities were sold in colonial sold these securities as they had lower performance characteristics than our average securities portfolio in a rates down environment 
the average duration of the company s securities portfolio was years at december  compared to years at december  securities also comprised of average earning assets in compared to in average interest bearing liabilities average interest bearing liabilities increased  primarily from growth in interest bearing deposits offset by a decline in the combined averages of short term borrowings and long term debt 
the average cost of interest bearing liabilities increased basis points to in  compared to in the increased average cost of funds in was primarily the result of increases in short term market rates and continued pressure to re price deposits due to competition and the matured re pricing of certificates of deposit in a higher rate environment 
interest bearing deposits 
average non time interest bearing deposits grew million  or in excluding acquisitions  sale of branches and brokered money market deposits 
this growth was primarily from sales efforts to emphasize relationship deposit growth  particularly in the savings product during average time deposits increased billion  or in excluding acquisitions  sale of branches and brokered certificates of deposit 
this significant growth was tied to the company s marketing campaign targeting growth in time deposits during the last quarter of the year 
the average rate on non time interest bearing deposits increased basis points to in compared to in  and the rate on time deposits increased basis points to an average of in compared to for the company s growth in low cost deposits has reduced its dependence on borrowings whereby total average deposits comprise of the company s total average funding liabilities for the year ended compared to in borrowings

average noninterest earning assets average noninterest earning assets increased million to billion from to the increase was due largely to an increase in bank owned life insurance boli and goodwill and fixed assets obtained through acquisitions 
average noninterest bearing liabilities average noninterest bearing liabilities increased million from to  a increase 
this change primarily relates to the increase in average noninterest bearing deposits of million in  a increase excluding acquisitions  sale of branches and brokered deposits 
this increase is a result of the company s continuing effort to increase low cost or no cost deposits 
net interest margin net interest margin increased basis points in to compared to in the growth in average earning assets  excluding mortgage warehouse lending assets  was funded by strong deposit growth and contributed a basis point increase to net interest margin 
mortgage warehouse lending assets consist of loans  loans held for sale and securities purchased under agreements to resell 
the growth in average mortgage warehouse lending assets increased net interest income  but had a dilutive effect on margin due to lower pricing spreads reducing net interest margin basis points 
in  the company sold interests in these mortgage warehouse lending assets to third party commercial paper conduits 
the average amount of mortgage warehouse lending assets sold in was million 
selling these lower margin assets had an accretive impact to our net interest margin resulting in a basis point increase for the year 
the company also sold securities and terminated fhlb advances in this resulted in a decrease to average volumes of million  but increased net interest margin basis points in loan loss provision the provision for loan losses for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the provision for loan loss exceeded net charge offs for both and by million and million  respectively 
net charge offs were and of average loans for the years ended december  and  respectively

a higher portion of account analysis charges were offset with earnings credits on deposit levels in than in the increase in nsf fees relates to the company s strong deposit growth in financial planning services include discount brokerage  investment sales  asset management  trust services and insurance sales including term  universal  whole life and long term care 
the decrease in was primarily due to declines in sales of fixed annuity products partially offset by increased sales of securities 
sales of fixed annuities slowed in as more customers were attracted to certificates of deposit 
electronic banking includes colonial s atm network  business and personal check card services and our internet banking with bill pay service 
the increases in electronic banking fees are primarily the result of deposit growth  increased check card and internet banking usage and additional penetration of the customer base 
mortgage banking income is generated from loans originated and subsequently sold in the secondary market 
we do not retain any servicing rights related to these loans 
the increase was primarily the result of a ramp up of originators and support personnel in the florida segment in the second quarter of this increase in personnel helped drive total secondary market production up million over in  the company structured a facility in which it sold certain mortgage warehouse loans and mortgage loans held for sale to a wholly owned special purpose entity which then sold interests in those assets to third party commercial paper conduits 
based on the structure of these transactions  the company receives servicing income based on a percentage of the outstanding balance of assets sold 
mortgage warehouse fees related to these transactions was approximately million in the remaining fees are custodial fees for maintaining mortgage files for customers 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding these transactions 
the company sold billion of securities and declared its intent to sell another million of securities in  incurring net losses of million 
refer to the net interest income section for further discussion of the securities transactions 
during  bancgroup sold branches in northwest alabama and three in tennessee 
the branches sold had million in deposits and million in loans

the construction portfolio is primarily made up of loans to finance construction projects within the company s banking markets and the growth in this category during was mostly in residential property types development  land zoned residential  home construction  residential lots and condominiums 
growth in commercial real estate loans reflects an increase in retail  office and warehouse property types offset by declines in lodging and multi family 
residential real estate loan growth was primarily driven by consumers continuing to take advantage of relatively low interest rates and through acquisitions 
the contractual maturities of loans may vary significantly from actual maturities due to loan extensions  early payoffs due to refinancing and other factors 
fluctuations in interest rates are also a major factor in early loan payoffs

risk management credit risk management colonial has some measure of credit risk in most of its primary banking activities  but the majority of this risk is associated with lending 
our credit risk management process is centered on comprehensive credit and underwriting policies and procedures  a strong and effective loan approval process  continual audit and review functions  and experienced credit professionals at the regional  business line  and bancgroup levels 
in addition  colonial has a credit risk reporting and analysis group and a special assets collections group which fall under the supervision of the chief credit officer 
the credit risk reporting and analysis group continually evaluates changes in credit risk  monitors large concentrations and exposures of all types and locations  and implements the bank s allowance methodology 
the special assets collections group is charged with minimizing losses  maximizing recoveries  and implementing strategies to reduce problem asset levels 
in addition  the internal auditor and regulatory examiners review and perform detailed tests of our credit risk management activities  such as credit underwriting  loan administration  and the allowance process 
the overall goals of our credit risk management activities include providing a sound basis for new credit extensions and early recognition of problems risks so that we can maintain a high quality loan portfolio and achieve long term earnings growth 
in addition to lending  credit risk is present in our securities portfolio  derivative instruments and in certain deposit activities 
the bank s investment and deposit functions area has credit risk management processes in place in order to manage credit risk in these activities 
loan approval and underwriting the chief credit officer  who reports directly to the chief executive officer  provides company wide credit oversight through a senior credit administration function 
this function reviews larger credits prior to approval and also provides an independent review of credits on a continual basis 
in addition  the company has established regional loan committees made up of local officers and directors that approve loans up to certain levels 
these committees provide local business and market expertise while bancgroup s senior management provides independent oversight by participating in the state loan committees 
loans to the company s largest borrowers and loans originated out of specialized business units may go through these committees for approval  but also may go through additional committees established by the board of directors and administered by the chief credit officer 
bancgroup has standard policies and procedures for the evaluation and underwriting of new credits  including debt service evaluations and collateral guidelines 
collateral guidelines vary with the creditworthiness of the borrower  but generally require loan to value ratios not to exceed for commercial real estate  for construction  for development  for raw land  and for residential real estate 
commercial non real estate  financial and agricultural loans are generally collateralized by business inventory  accounts receivables or new business equipment at  and of estimated value  respectively 
installment and consumer loan collateral  where required  is based on or lower loan to value ratios 
collateral values referenced above are monitored and estimated by loan officers through inspections  independent appraisals  reference to broad measures of market values  and current experience with similar properties or collateral 
loans with loan to value ratios in excess of have potentially higher risks which are offset by other factors including the borrowers or guarantors creditworthiness  deposit and other aspects of the overall relationship  the customer s history with colonial  and any other potential sources of repayment 
concentration bancgroup has a significant concentration of commercial real estate and construction loans representing and of total loans as of december   respectively 
bancgroup s commercial real estate and construction loans are spread geographically throughout alabama  florida and other areas including metropolitan atlanta  dallas  reno and las vegas with no more than of total commercial real estate and construction loans in any one metropolitan statistical area msa 
the alabama economy generally experiences a slow but steady rate of growth  while bancgroup s markets in florida  georgia  nevada and texas are experiencing higher rates of growth 
the collateral held in the commercial real estate and construction portfolios consists of various property types such as retail properties  family residential developments and lots  office buildings  land held for future development or construction  residential homes under construction  multi family housing  condominium properties  warehouses  lodging and health service facilities 
the relatively small average loan size and the application of conservative underwriting guidelines further reduce risk 
net charge offs to average loans for the commercial real estate portfolio were for net charge offs to average loans for the construction portfolio were for in addition to mortgages on the subject properties  substantially all construction and commercial real estate loans have personal guarantees of the principals involved 
the owner occupied commercial real estate portfolio represented of the total commercial real estate portfolio outstanding at december  owner occupied real estate is primarily dependent on cash flows from operating businesses rather than on the sale or rental of the property  therefore  these loans carry less risk than other commercial real estate loans 
management believes that its existing diversity of commercial real estate and construction loans  whether grouped geographically  by industry  or by borrower  reduces bancgroup s risk exposure 
the current distribution of commercial real estate and construction loans remains diverse in location  size  and collateral function 
this diversification  in addition to our emphasis on quality underwriting  serves to reduce the risk of losses

bancgroup has a history of successfully lending in the residential real estate market and its quality ratios remain favorable in this portfolio segment 
net charge offs to average loans for the residential real estate portfolio were for loans classified as commercial  financial  and agricultural  representing of total loans  consist of secured and unsecured credit lines and equipment loans for various industrial  agricultural  commercial  financial  retail  or service businesses 
the risks associated with loans in this category are generally related to the earnings capacity of  and the cash flows generated from  the individual business activities of the borrowers 
consumer loans  representing of total loans  are loans to individuals for various purposes 
vehicle loans and unsecured loans make up the majority of these loans 
the principal source of repayment is the earning capacity of the individual borrower  as well as the value of the collateral for secured loans 
bancgroup maintains a mortgage warehouse lending division 
this department provides lines of credit collateralized by residential mortgage loans and other services to mortgage origination companies 
warehouse loans outstanding at december  were million  with unfunded commitments of million 
the company has credits with commitments funded and unfunded of million that fall within the bank regulatory definition of a shared national credit generally defined as a total loan commitment in excess of million that is shared by three or more lenders 
the largest outstanding amount to any single borrower is million which is a mortgage warehouse lending credit  with the smallest outstanding credit being approximately at december   million of these commitments were funded 
although by definition these commitments are considered shared national credits  bancgroup s loan officers have established long term relationships with each of these borrowers 
these commitments are comprised of the following mortgage warehouse lines to large institutions  commercial real estate credit facilities to companies with headquarters located within colonial s existing markets  and two operating facilities to a large national insurance company and a healthcare provider 
management believes that these are sound participations involving credits that fit within colonial s lending philosophy and meet its conservative underwriting guidelines 
allowance for loan losses colonial  through its lending and credit functions  continuously reviews its loan portfolio for credit risk 
colonial employs an independent credit review area that reviews the lending and credit functions to validate that credit risks are appropriately identified 
the company remains committed to the early recognition of problem loans and to ensuring an adequate level of allowance to cover losses 
at december   the company s total allowance was million  which represented of period end loans 
using input from the company s comprehensive credit risk identification process  the company s credit risk management area analyzes and validates the company s loan loss reserve methodology at least quarterly 
the analysis includes three basic components specific allowances for individual loans  general allowances for loan pools  and allowances based on identified economic conditions and other risk factors 
the credit risk management area  along with senior management  review the methodology and ensure it is appropriate and that all material risk elements have been assessed in order to determine the appropriate level of allowance for the inherent losses in the loan portfolio at each quarter end 
in addition  the allowance methodology is discussed with and reviewed quarterly by the audit committee 
the first component of the allowance for loan losses analysis involves the calculation of specific allowances for individual impaired loans as required by sfas  accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
in addition  the company requires that a broad group of loans be tested for impairment each quarter this includes all loans of  and over that have internal risk ratings below a predetermined classification level  plus all significantly past due loans of  and over 
the credit risk management area validates all impairment testing and validates the reserve allocations for all impaired loans each quarter 
reserves associated with this element are based on a thorough analysis of the most probable sources of repayment which is normally the liquidation of collateral  but may also includes discounted future cash flows or the market value of the loan itself 
as of december  and  the specific allowance calculations for this element of the allowance totaled million and million  respectively 
the decrease in the reserve between these two periods primarily resulted from a decline in the dollar amount of loans that met the criteria for impaired status 
the second reserve component is the general allowance for loan pools assessed by applying loan loss allowance factors to groups of loans within the portfolio that have similar characteristics 
this part of the methodology is governed by sfas  accounting for contingencies 
the general allowance factors are based upon recent and historical charge off experience and are typically applied to the portfolio by loan type and internal risk rating 
historical loss analyses provide the basis for factors used for homogenous pools of smaller loans  such as residential real estate and other consumer loan categories which are not evaluated based on individual risk ratings but almost entirely based on historical losses 
the statistics used in the analysis of this second reserve component are adjusted quarterly based on loss trends and risk rating migrations 
as of december  and  the general allowance calculations totaled million and million  respectively 
the increase between the periods was primarily the result of portfolio growth which was partially offset by lower criticized and classified risk assets 
the third component of the allowance represents the effect of risks or losses that are not fully captured elsewhere  and includes amounts for new loan products or portfolio segments which are deemed to have risks not included in the other model elements  macroeconomic factors and model imprecision 
the company analyzes and revises this part of the allowance at least quarterly 
the qualitative risk factors of this third allowance segment are subjective and require a high degree of management judgment 
as of december  and  the allowance calculated for economic conditions and other risk factors relating to specific loan categories totaled million and million  respectively 
this component change in this portion of the reserve is due to increased interest rates in that subject the commercial real estate and construction portfolios to increased loss levels as well as other economic factors impacting commercial real estate 
in addition to the allocated portions  an amount is calculated to adjust the allowance for imprecision inherent in estimates used for the allocated portions of the reserve 
the unallocated allowance is the result of management s judgment of risks inherent in the portfolio  economic uncertainties and other subjective factors  including industry trends 
at december  and  the unallocated allowance was million and million  respectively

when management determines that a loan no longer meets the criteria for a performing loan and collection of interest appears doubtful  the loan is placed on nonaccrual status 
loans are generally placed on nonaccrual if full collection of principal and interest becomes unlikely even if all payments are current or if the loan is delinquent in principal or interest payments for days or more  unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection 
bancgroup s policy is to charge off consumer installment loans days past due unless they are in the process of foreclosure and are adequately collateralized 
management closely monitors all loans that are contractually days past due  renegotiated or nonaccrual 
these loans are summarized as follows nonperforming assets december  in thousands aggregate loans for which interest is not being accrued aggregate loans renegotiated to provide a reduction or deferral of interest or principal because of deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower total nonperforming loans other real estate and in substance foreclosure repossessions total nonperforming assets aggregate loans contractually past due days or more for which interest is being accrued total nonperforming loans as a percent of net loans total nonperforming assets as a percent of net loans  other real estate and repossessions total nonperforming loans and day past due loans for which interest is being accrued as a percent of net loans allowance for loan loss as a percent of nonperforming loans nonaccrual and renegotiated total does not include loans contractually past due days or more  which are still accruing interest the above nonperforming loans represent all material credits for which management has significant doubts as to the ability of the borrowers to comply with the loan repayment terms 
management also expects that the resolution of these problem credits as well as other performing loans will not materially impact future operating results  liquidity or capital resources 
the balance of nonperforming assets declined million  or during the year ended december  as a result of the resolution of problem assets through the sale of the loans or sale of underlying property  charge off  and payoffs 
the balance of nonperforming assets can fluctuate due to changes in economic conditions  nonperforming assets obtained in acquisitions  and the disproportionate impact of larger assets 
historically colonial has consistently experienced favorable levels of nonperforming assets 
the recent improvements in nonperforming assets and other credit quality measures are the result of additional improvements in collection  work out and risk management efforts as well as overall favorable economic conditions 
interest income recognized and interest income foregone on nonaccrual loans were not significant for the years ended december     and a loan is considered impaired  based on current information and events  if it is probable that the company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
as mentioned previously  colonial s credit risk management area performs detailed verification and testing to ensure appropriate identification of impaired loans and that proper reserves are held on these loans 
the recorded investment in impaired loans at december  and was million and million  respectively  and these loans had a corresponding valuation allowance of million and million  respectively 
the average investment in impaired loans during and totaled million and million  respectively 
the decrease in impaired loans is primarily due to the resolution of several problem credits 
management  through its loan officers  internal credit review staff and external examinations by regulatory agencies  has identified approximately million of loans which have been placed on a classified loan list excluding nonaccrual  other real estate  repossessions and loans that are contractually days past due 
the status of all material classified loans is reviewed at least monthly by loan officers and quarterly by bancgroup s centralized credit administration function 
in connection with such reviews  collateral values are updated where considered necessary 
if collateral values are judged insufficient or other sources of repayment are deemed inadequate  the amount of reserve held is increased or the loan is reduced to estimated recoverable amounts 
as of december   substantially all of these classified loans are current with their existing repayment terms 
management believes that classification of such loans well in advance of their reaching a delinquent status allows the company the greatest flexibility in correcting problems and providing adequate reserves 
given the reserves and the demonstrated ability of the borrowers to comply with the existing repayment terms  management believes any exposure from these loans has been adequately addressed at the present time 
asset liability management asset liability management involves the evaluation  monitoring and management of interest rate risk  liquidity and funding 
the board of directors has overall responsibility for colonial s asset liability management policies 
to ensure adherence to these policies  the asset and liability committee alco establishes and monitors guidelines to control the sensitivity of earnings to changes in interest rates 
the guidelines apply to both on and off balance sheet positions 
the goal of the alco process is to maximize earnings while carefully controlling interest rate risk 
interest rate risk interest rate risk  and its potential effects on earnings  are inherent in the operations of a financial institution 
we are subject to interest rate risk because assets and liabilities may mature or re price at different times for example  if assets re price faster than liabilities and interest rates are generally falling  earnings will initially decline  assets and liabilities may re price at the same time but by different amounts for example  when the general level of interest rates is falling  we may reduce rates paid on checking and savings deposit accounts by an amount that is less than the general decline in market interest rates  short term and long term market interest rates may change by different amounts ie  the shape of the yield curve may affect new loan yields and funding costs differently  or the remaining maturity of various assets or liabilities may shorten or lengthen as interest rates change for example  if long term mortgage interest rates decline sharply  mortgage backed securities held in the securities available for sale portfolio may prepay significantly earlier than anticipated which could reduce portfolio income 
in addition  interest rates may have an indirect impact on loan demand  credit losses  mortgage origination volume  the value of the pension liability and other sources of earnings 
asset liability management activities include lending  accepting and placing deposits  investing in securities  issuing debt and hedging interest rate risk 
sensitivity of earnings to interest rate changes arises when yields on assets change in a different time period or in a different amount from that of interest cost on liabilities 
to mitigate interest rate risk  the structure of the balance sheet is managed so that movements of interest rates on assets and liabilities are highly correlated in a manner intended to allow colonial s interest bearing assets and liabilities to contribute to earnings even in periods of volatile interest rates 
colonial employs the following measurement techniques in the management of interest rate risk simulation of earnings and simulation of the economic value of equity 
these techniques are complementary and are used in concert to provide a comprehensive interest rate risk management capability 
simulation of earnings is the primary tool used to measure the sensitivity of earnings to interest rate changes 
using computer modeling techniques  colonial is able to measure the potential impact of different interest rate assumptions on pre tax earnings 
all balance sheet positions  including derivative financial instruments  are included in the model simulation 
the following table represents the output from the company s simulation model based on the balance sheet at december  with comparable prior year information 
the table measures  consistently for both years  the impact on net interest income of an immediate and sustained change in all market interest rates in basis point increments for the calendar months following the date of the change 
this twelve month projection of net interest income under these scenarios is compared to the twelve month net interest income projection with rates unchanged 
as shown in the tables  the company s balance sheet became less asset sensitive from december  on the asset side  a decrease in the proportion of variable rate loans from of total loans in to in decreased asset sensitivity 
given the general level of market rates  incremental cash flows on the investment portfolio are lower in both rising and falling rates  causing less asset sensitivity 
on the liability side  the liabilities have become less sensitive to changes in rates due to an increase in deposits and a decrease in wholesale funding 
basis points change fed funds rate percentage change in month projected net interest income versus projected net interest income under no rate change december  december  no rate change n m the computation of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions  including relative levels of market interest rates  estimates of rates on loans and deposits given these rate changes  the ability to maintain interest rate floors on loans as market rates decline  deposit decay rates and loan investment prepayments 
further  the computations do not take into account changes to the slope of the yield curve  changes in the relative relationship of various market rates  changes in the volume or mix of asset and liabilities on the balance sheet nor do they contemplate any actions bancgroup could undertake in response to changes in interest rates 
rate scenario is deemed so unlikely  value would not be meaningful 
colonial also measures interest rate risk by simulating the impact of changes in interest rates to the market value of equity 
the potential effect of these interest rate changes is derived from the impact of such changes on the market value of assets and liabilities 
colonial analyzes the changes in market value of equity to ensure that the company maintains an adequate capital position 
the following table represents the output of the simulation model for the economic value of equity eve  which is defined as the net present value of interest rate sensitive assets  interest rate sensitive liabilities and off balance sheet contracts 
the table represents the percentage change in the eve under basis point parallel rate shocks versus the eve assuming rates at december  and basis points change fed funds rates change in net portfolio value vs 
eve under no rate change december  december  no rate change n m rate scenario is deemed so unlikely value would not be meaningful 
liquidity and funding liquidity is the ability of an organization to meet its financial commitments and obligations on a timely basis 
these commitments and obligations include credit needs of customers  withdrawals by depositors  repayment of debt when due and payment of operating expenses and dividends 
management of liquidity also includes management of funding sources and their utilization based on current  future and contingency needs 
maintaining and managing adequate liquidity and funding are other prominent focuses of alco 
retail deposit growth is a primary focus of bancgroup s funding and liquidity strategy 
colonial s average non time deposits grew by billion  or excluding brokered money market accounts  acquisitions and branch sales from total deposits increased by billion  or excluding brokered deposits  acquisitions and branch sales  from december  with branches in four of the top five population growth states  retail deposits are a major component of bancgroup s funding growth 
bancgroup finished the year with internal growth in average non time deposits  and of the company s non time deposits were in florida 
bancgroup has worked to expand the availability of short term and long term wholesale funding sources in addition to the emphasis on core deposit growth 
the company draws on a variety of funding sources to assist in funding loan growth  securities acquisitions and deposit fluctuations 
fed funds lines  repurchase agreements and issuances of commercial paper are sources for short term borrowings 
availability from the federal home loan bank of atlanta fhlb is also an important part of bancgroup s wholesale funding sources 
credit facilities with the fhlb are used for both short and long term borrowings 
as of december   the lendable collateral value pledged to the fhlb amounted to billion down from billion the prior year due to a reduction of securities pledged 
the fhlb will continue to provide an important source of wholesale liquidity 
from time to time bancgroup has issued subordinated debentures  subordinated notes and junior subordinated debt to provide both capital and funding 
over the course of  bancgroup focused on the growth of retail deposits and brokered cds to replace short term borrowings and to match the short term funding requirement of mortgage warehouse lending cycles 
by year end  short term borrowings from the fhlb had decreased billion from short term borrowings were comprised of the following at december   and in thousands fhlb borrowings federal funds purchased repurchase agreements retail repurchase agreements wholesale total short term borrowings additional details regarding short term borrowings are shown below maximum outstanding at any month end average balance average interest rate average interest rate at december in thousands fhlb borrowings federal funds purchased other short term borrowings fhlb borrowings federal funds purchased other short term borrowings fhlb borrowings federal funds purchased other short term borrowings long term borrowings were comprised of the following at december   and in thousands fhlb borrowings repurchase agreements long term wholesale subordinated notes junior subordinated debentures variable rate subordinated debentures other total long term borrowings includes an adjustment to fair market value as required by sfas  due to related interest rate swaps

operational risk management in providing banking services  colonial processes cash  checks  wires and ach transactions which expose colonial to operational risk 
controls over such processing activities are closely monitored to safeguard the assets of colonial and its customers 
however  from time to time  colonial has incurred losses related to these processes and there can be no assurance that such losses will not occur in the future 
operational risk is the risk of unexpected losses attributable to human error  systems failures  fraud  or inadequate internal controls and procedures 
this risk is mitigated through a system of internal controls that are designed to keep operational risk at levels appropriate to colonial s corporate standards in view of the risks inherent in the markets in which colonial operates 
the system of internal controls includes policies and procedures that require the proper authorization  approval  documentation and monitoring of transactions 
each business unit is responsible for complying with corporate policies and procedures to do so 
colonial s internal auditors monitor the overall effectiveness of the system of internal controls on an ongoing basis
