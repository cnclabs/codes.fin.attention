introduction business overview we are primarily a truckload carrier based in phoenix  arizona 
we transport general commodities for shippers throughout the united states  generally focusing our operations on a short to medium length of haul 
we provide regional truckload carrier services from our regional dry van service centers  and from our temperature controlled service centers 
during we began providing brokerage services 
the results of the brokerage activities were relatively immaterial for and therefore a detailed discussion of the financial results of these operations will not be separately presented 
at december   we operated dry van service centers  two temperature controlled service centers  and two brokerage service centers 
in early  we added three new service centers 
we presently have dry van service centers  three temperature controlled service centers  and three brokerage service centers 
over the past five years we have achieved substantial revenue and income growth 
during this period  our revenue  before fuel surcharge  grew at a compounded annual rate from million in to million in  and our net income grew at a compounded annual rate from million in to million in operating and growth strategy our operating strategy is focused on the following core elements focusing on regional operations 
we seek to operate primarily in high density  predictable traffic lanes in selected geographic regions 
we believe our regional operations allow us to obtain greater freight volumes and higher revenue per mile  and also enhance safety and driver recruitment and retention 
maintaining operating efficiencies and controlling costs 
we focus almost exclusively on operating in distinct geographic and shipping markets in order to achieve increased penetration of targeted service areas and higher equipment utilization in dense traffic lanes 
we actively seek to control costs by  among other things  operating a modern equipment fleet  maintaining a high driver to non driver employee ratio  and regulating vehicle speed 
providing a high level of customer service 
we seek to compete on the basis of service  in addition to price  and offer our customers a broad range of services to meet their specific needs  including multiple pick ups and deliveries  on time pick ups and deliveries within narrow time frames  dedicated fleet and personnel  and specialized driver training 
using technology to enhance our business 
our tractors are equipped with a satellite based tracking and communications system to permit us to stay in contact with our drivers  obtain load position updates  and provide our customers with freight visibility 
a significant number of our trailers are equipped with tracking technology to allow us to manage our trailers more effectively  maintain a low trailer to tractor ratio  efficiently assess detention fees  and minimize cargo loss 
the primary source of our revenue growth has been our ability to open and develop new regional service centers in selected geographic areas and operate them at or near our targeted margins within a relatively short period of time 
during  we established regional dry van service centers in chicago  illinois  el paso  texas  and reno  nevada 
our temperature controlled service centers were increased by the acquisition in of edwards bros  inc  in idaho falls  idaho 
we also established brokerage service centers in idaho falls  idaho and phoenix  arizona  during based on our current expectations concerning the economy  we anticipate opening six or seven additional regional service centers in and adding approximately new tractors system wide during the year 
as part of our growth strategy  we also periodically evaluate acquisition opportunities  and we will continue to consider acquisitions that meet our financial and operating criteria 

table of contents revenue and expenses we primarily generate revenue by transporting freight for our customers 
generally  we are paid a predetermined rate per mile or per load for our services 
we enhance our revenue by charging for tractor and trailer detention  loading and unloading activities  and other specialized services  as well as through the collection of fuel surcharges to mitigate the impact of increases in the cost of fuel 
the main factors that affect our revenue are the revenue per mile we receive from our customers  the percentage of miles for which we are compensated  and the number of miles we generate with our equipment 
these factors relate  among other things  to the general level of economic activity in the united states  inventory levels  specific customer demand  the level of capacity in the trucking industry  and driver availability 
historically  excess capacity in the transportation industry had limited our ability to improve rates 
however  beginning in continuing through  the united states economy experienced growth  which  together with tighter capacity  contributed to higher freight rates throughout much of the industry  including a improvement in our average revenue per loaded mile excluding fuel surcharge from to the main factors that impact our profitability in terms of expenses are the variable costs of transporting freight for our customers 
these costs include fuel expense  driver related expenses  such as wages  benefits  training  and recruitment  and independent contractor costs  which are recorded on the purchased transportation line of our consolidated statements of income 
expenses that have both fixed and variable components include maintenance and tire expense and our total cost of insurance and claims 
these expenses generally vary with the miles we travel  but also have a controllable component based on safety  fleet age  efficiency  and other factors 
our main fixed costs are the acquisition and financing of long term assets  such as revenue equipment and terminal facilities and the compensation of non driver personnel 
effectively controlling our expenses is an important element of assuring our profitability 
the primary measure we use to evaluate our profitability is operating ratio  excluding the impact of fuel surcharge revenue operating expenses  net of fuel surcharge  as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge 
we view any operating ratio  whether for the company or any service center  in excess of as unacceptable performance in the current environment 
recent results of operations and year end financial condition for the year ended december   our results of operations improved as follows versus the fiscal year revenue  before fuel surcharge  increased  to million from million  net income increased  to million from million  and net income per diluted share increased to from 
we believe the improvements in our profitability are attributable primarily to higher average revenue per tractor per week excluding fuel surcharge  our main measure of asset productivity  which increased  to  in from  in this improvement was driven by a increase in average revenue per loaded mile excluding fuel surcharge to from  offset by a decrease in average miles per tractor to  from  we were able to increase our average revenue per loaded mile due to strong freight demand and a solid rate environment in brought on by growth in the us economy and a favorable relationship between demand and trucking capacity 
we also experienced a slight increase in the percentage of non revenue miles  to in from in  mainly due to the positioning of our revenue equipment in areas which allowed us to capitalize on the most favorable freight in terms of higher rates 
during  we grew our fleet by adding new tractors  and we periodically experienced temporary challenges attracting a sufficient number of drivers to optimize utilization of our expanding tractor fleet 
in response to this challenge  we placed additional emphasis on our driver recruiting and retention efforts 
this emphasis on recruiting and retention  combined with increases in driver compensation in totaling three cents per mile have resulted in nearly all of our trucks being fully seated at year end at december  our balance sheet reflected million in cash and cash equivalents  million in short term investments  no debt  and shareholders equity of million 
for the year  we generated million in cash flow from operations and used million for net capital expenditures 

table of contents our liquidity is not materially affected by off balance sheet transactions 
like many other trucking companies  periodically we have utilized operating leases to finance a portion of our revenue equipment acquisitions 
we have tractors under operating leases at december  future operating lease commitments as of december  was million 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage relationships of our expense items to total revenue and revenue  before fuel surcharge  for each of the three fiscal years indicated below 
fuel expense as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  is calculated using fuel expense  net of surcharge 
management believes that eliminating the impact of this sometimes volatile source of revenue affords a more consistent basis for comparing our results of operations from period to period 
total revenue revenue  before fuel surcharge operating expenses operating expenses salaries  wages and benefits salaries  wages and benefits fuel fuel operations and maintenance operations and maintenance insurance and claims insurance and claims operating taxes and licenses operating taxes and licenses communications communications depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization lease expense revenue equipment lease expense revenue equipment purchased transportation purchased transportation gain loss on sale of equipment gain loss on sale of equipment miscellaneous operating expenses miscellaneous operating expenses total operating expenses total operating expenses income from operations income from operations net interest and other income expense net interest and other income expense income before income taxes income before income taxes income taxes income taxes net income net income net of fuel surcharge 
a discussion of our results of operations for the periods to and to is set forth below 
fiscal compared to fiscal total revenue for increased to million from million for total revenue included million of fuel surcharge revenue in and million of fuel surcharge revenue in in discussing our results of operations we use revenue  before fuel surcharge and fuel expense  net of surcharge  because management believes that eliminating the impact of this sometimes volatile source of revenue affords a more consistent basis for comparing our results of operations from period to period 
we also discuss the changes in our expenses as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  rather than absolute dollar changes 
we do this because we believe the high variable cost nature of our business makes a comparison of changes in expenses as a percentage of revenue more meaningful than absolute dollar changes 
revenue  before fuel surcharge  increased to million for  up from million in this increase is due to the combination of fleet expansion  improved revenue per mile  the opening of three additional dry van regional service centers  opening of a brokerage service center in july  and the acquisition of edwards bros  inc edwards bros  a temperature controlled carrier in august revenue generated from edwards bros 
accounted for approximately of the total increase 
as a result of the expansion  our tractor fleet grew to  tractors including owned by independent contractors as of december   from  tractors 
the growth in the fleet  coupled with improved freight demand  and a increase in average revenue per tractor per week in over  resulted in the significant period over period improvement in freight revenue 
these improvements were partially offset by a decrease in average miles per tractor and a increase in our percentage of non revenue miles 

table of contents salaries  wages and benefits expense increased slightly as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  to in from in the increase is primarily due to increases in driver pay rates implemented in  along with an increase in the percentage of our fleet operated by company drivers  as opposed to independent contractors 
amounts paid to independent contractors for hauling freight are recorded on the purchased transportation line of our consolidated statements of income 
for the year ended december   an average of of our fleet was operated by company drivers  compared to an average of for the year ended december  for our drivers  we record accruals for workers compensation benefits as a component of our claims accrual  and the related expense is reflected in salaries  wages and benefits in our consolidated statements of income 
fuel expense  net of fuel surcharge  remained constant as a percentage of revenue before fuel surcharge  at for both and this was mainly due to improved collection of fuel surcharge revenue during  which offset higher fuel prices 
we maintain a fuel surcharge program to assist us in recovering a portion of increased fuel costs 
for the year ended december   fuel surcharge was million  compared to million for the same period in as a percentage of total revenue  including fuel surcharge  fuel expense increased to in  compared to in  as a result of higher fuel prices 
we believe that higher fuel prices may continue to adversely affect our operating expenses throughout and that continued unrest in the middle east and other areas  in addition to hurricanes and other weather related events  also may cause the price of fuel to increase 
operations and maintenance expense increased as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  to for from in this increase is mainly due to an increase in the percentage of company owned tractors  which led to higher operating expenses 
the percentage of company owned tractors increased to an average of for  from in the average age of our revenue equipment at year end remained at years for both and insurance and claims expense decreased as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  to for  compared to for the decrease is due to better claims experience and lower claims costs in operating taxes and license expense as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  increased slightly to for from for the slight increase is primarily due to growth of our company fleet  which was mostly offset by improvements in average revenue per tractor in communications expense as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  remained constant at for both and depreciation and amortization expense  as a percentage of revenue before fuel surcharge  increased to for from in the increase in depreciation and amortization expense is offset by a corresponding decrease in lease expense for revenue equipment and purchased transportation 
during the year  most of our company fleet was purchased by cash 
at december   we had tractors held under operating leases that were acquired through the edwards bros 
acquisition 
lease expense for revenue equipment  as a percentage of revenue before fuel surcharge  decreased to less than for  compared to for this decrease is a result of the reduction in the number of tractors we held under operating leases  as discussed above 
the combination of depreciation and lease expense remained constant at for both and purchased transportation expense as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  decreased to for compared to for the decrease is due to the combination of improvements in revenue per mile  along with the decrease in the percentage of our total fleet comprised of independent contractors 
as of december   of our total fleet was operated by independent contractors  compared to at december  as of december   our total fleet included tractors owned and operated by independent contractors  compared to tractors owned and operated by independent contractors at december  purchased transportation represents the amount an independent contractor is paid to haul freight for us on a mutually agreed upon per mile basis 
to assist us in continuing to attract independent contractors  we may provide financing to qualified independent contractors to assist them in acquiring revenue equipment 
as of december   we had  in loans outstanding net of allowance for doubtful accounts of  to independent contractors to purchase revenue equipment 
these loans are secured by liens on the revenue equipment we finance 
gain on sale of equipment as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  increased to in  compared to zero in the increase is due to revenue equipment being sold to independent parties in  as opposed to primarily being traded back to the equipment manufacturers 

table of contents miscellaneous operating expenses as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  increased to in  compared to in the slight increase is mostly due to the combination of higher bad debt reserves recorded and higher facility repair and maintenance expense incurred as a result of owning additional service centers 
as a result of the above factors  our operating ratio operating expenses  net of fuel surcharge  expressed as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge was for  compared to for net interest income expense as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  remained at less than for both and we had no outstanding debt at december  or other expense for was comprised of gains resulting from the sale of our investment in concentrek along with a reduction in the carrying value of our investment in transportation resource partners 
other expense as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  was for  compared to zero for income taxes have been provided at the statutory federal and state rates  adjusted for certain permanent differences between financial statement income and income for tax reporting 
our effective tax rate was for and for income tax expense as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  increased to for  compared to for  primarily due to the increase in income before income taxes that was offset by a slight decrease in the effective income tax rate in as a result of the preceding changes  our net income  as a percentage of revenue before fuel surcharge  was for  compared to in fiscal compared to fiscal our total revenue for increased to million from million for total revenue included million of fuel surcharge revenue in and million of fuel surcharge revenue in in discussing our results of operations we use revenue  before fuel surcharge and fuel expense  net of surcharge  because management believes that eliminating the impact of this sometimes volatile source of revenue affords a more consistent basis for comparing our results of operations from period to period 
we also discuss the changes in our expenses as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  rather than absolute dollar changes 
we do this because we believe the high variable cost nature of our business makes a comparison of changes in expenses as a percentage of revenue more meaningful than absolute dollar changes 
revenue  before fuel surcharge  increased to million for up from million in this increase primarily resulted from the expansion of our fleet and customer base and increased volume from existing customers  continued market development from existing service centers  the opening of three additional regional dry van service centers and the establishment of a temperature controlled subsidiary in  as well as improved rates and utilization 
as a result of our expansion into new regions and improving freight demand  our tractor fleet grew to  tractors including owned by independent contractors as of december   from  tractors including owned by independent contractors as of december  this growth in our fleet  coupled with a increase in average revenue per tractor per week in over  resulted in the significant period over period improvement in revenue 
salaries  wages and benefits expense increased as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  to in from in  primarily due to increases in driver pay rates of approximately three cents per mile during  as well as an increase in the percentage of our total fleet operated by company drivers  as opposed to independent contractors 
amounts paid to independent contractors for hauling freight are recorded on the purchased transportation line of our consolidated statements of income 
as of december   of our fleet was operated by company drivers  compared to as of december  for our drivers  we record accruals for workers compensation benefits as a component of our claims accrual  and the related expense is reflected in salaries  wages and benefits in our consolidated statements of income 
fuel expense  net of fuel surcharge  remained essentially constant as a percentage of revenue before fuel surcharge  at for and in this was mainly due to improved collection of fuel surcharge revenue during  which offset higher fuel prices 
the company maintains a fuel surcharge program to assist us in recovering a portion of increased fuel costs 
for the year ended december   fuel surcharge was million  compared to million for the same period in as a percentage of total revenue  including fuel surcharge  fuel expense increased to for from in as a result of higher fuel prices 

table of contents operations and maintenance expense increased as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  to for from in this increase was primarily due to increased costs for driver recruiting expenses 
independent contractors pay for the maintenance on their own vehicles 
insurance and claims expense increased as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  to for  compared to for  primarily as a result of an increase in insurance premiums and self insurance claims costs incurred by the company 
operating taxes and license expense as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  decreased to for from for the decrease resulted primarily from improvements in average revenue per tractor per week in  which more efficiently covered these costs 
communications expense as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  remained constant at for both and depreciation and amortization expense  as a percentage of revenue before fuel surcharge  increased to for from in this increase was primarily related to an increase in the percentage of our company fleet comprised of purchased vehicles 
our company fleet includes purchased vehicles and vehicles held under operating leases  while our total fleet includes vehicles in our company fleet as well as vehicles provided by independent contractors 
at december   of our company fleet was comprised of purchased vehicles  compared to at december  lease expense for revenue equipment  as a percentage of revenue before fuel surcharge  decreased to for  compared to for  primarily as a result of a decrease in the percentage of the company fleet comprised of vehicles held under operating leases  as discussed above 
during  we exercised early buy out options on all of our tractors that were held under operating leases at the beginning of the year 
the equipment purchased upon termination of these operating leases was capitalized into our fleet during purchased transportation expense as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  decreased to for compared to for this decrease was primarily due to the relative decrease in the percentage of our total fleet operated by independent contractors in as of december   of our total fleet was operated by independent contractors  compared to at december  as of december   our total fleet included tractors owned and operated by independent contractors  compared to tractors owned and operated by independent contractors at december  purchased transportation represents the amount an independent contractor is paid to haul freight for us on a mutually agreed upon per mile basis

other expense as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  was for income taxes have been provided at the statutory federal and state rates  adjusted for certain permanent differences between financial statement income and income for tax reporting 
our effective tax rate was for and for income tax expense as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  increased to for  from for  primarily due to the increase in income before income taxes and a slightly higher tax rate in as a result of the preceding changes  our net income  as a percentage of revenue before fuel surcharge  was for  compared to in 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources the growth of our business has required  and will continue to require  a significant investment in new revenue equipment 
our primary sources of liquidity have been funds provided by operations  and to a lesser extent lease financing arrangements  issuances of equity securities  and borrowings under our line of credit 
net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million  million  and million for the years ended december    and respectively 
the increase for was primarily the result of an increase in income from operations due to our fleet expansion and improved revenue per mile 
capital expenditures for the purchase of revenue equipment  net of equipment sales and trade ins  office equipment  and land and leasehold improvements  totaled million  million  and million for the years ended december    and respectively 
we currently anticipate capital expenditures  net of trade ins  of approximately million for we expect these capital expenditures will be used primarily to acquire new revenue equipment 
net cash used in financing activities was approximately million for the year ended december   compared to cash provided in financing of approximately  for the year ended cash used in financing for the year ended december  consisted of million of debt payment associated with the acquisition of edwards bros  inc  million paid for cash dividends to common stock shareholders  and million of proceeds from stock option exercises 
the cash provided by financing in the year was a result of the net proceeds from stock options exercised 
net cash used for financing activities was approximately million for the year ended december   which was primarily for the payments on our line of credit and long term debt  which was retired in full during the fourth quarter of at december   we did not have any outstanding debt 
we currently maintain a line of credit  which permits revolving borrowings and letters of credit totaling million 
at december   the line of credit consisted solely of issued but unused letters of credit totaling million 
we are obligated to comply with certain financial covenants under our line of credit and were in compliance with these covenants at december    and as of december   we held million in cash and cash equivalents 
management believes we will be able to finance our near term needs for working capital over the next twelve months  as well as acquisitions of revenue equipment during such period  with cash balances and cash flows from operations 
we will continue to have significant capital requirements over the long term  which may require us to incur debt or seek additional equity capital 
the availability of additional capital will depend upon prevailing market conditions  the market price of our common stock  and several other factors over which we have limited control  as well as our financial condition and results of operations 
nevertheless  based on our recent operating results  current cash position  anticipated future cash flows  and sources of financing that we expect will be available to us  we do not expect that we will experience any significant liquidity constraints in the foreseeable future 
off balance sheet transactions our liquidity is not materially affected by off balance sheet transactions 
like many other trucking companies  periodically we have utilized operating leases to finance a portion of our revenue equipment acquisitions 
at december   we had tractors held under operating leases with varying termination dates ranging from march to september future operating lease commitments as of december  were million  with  due in the next months 
the effective annual interest rates under these operating leases range from to 
lease payments in respect of such vehicles are reflected in our income statements in the line item lease expense revenue equipment 
our rental expense related to operating leases was million in  compared to million in 
table of contents tabular disclosure of contractual obligations the following table sets forth  as of december   our contractual obligations and payments due by corresponding period for our short and long term operating expenses and other commitments 
payments in millions due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years purchase obligations revenue equipment investment in transportation resource partners  lp trp n a n a n a n a operating leases revenue equipment operating leases terminal building potential pay out relating to edwards bros  inc acquisition total purchase obligations revenue equipment represent the total purchase price under commitments to purchase tractors and trailers scheduled for delivery throughout trp commitment is expected to be made through variable contribution amounts over the next five years 
on august   the company acquired of the stock of edwards bros  inc the purchase agreement describes potential future payments due on or before march  the potential pay out is contingent upon the outcome of retaining existing drivers and maintaining revenue levels with existing customers 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires that management make a number of assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable 
although these estimates are based on management s best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future  actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions 
our critical accounting policies are those that affect  or could affect  our financial statements materially and involve a significant level of judgment by management 
our significant accounting policies including revenue recognition and assessing possible impairments on long lived assets and intangibles are described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item depreciation 
property and equipment are stated at cost 
depreciation on property and equipment is calculated by the straight line method over the estimated useful life  which ranges from three to thirty years  down to an estimated salvage value of the property and equipment  which ranges from to of the capitalized cost 
we periodically evaluate the useful lives and salvage values of our property and equipment based upon  among other things  our experience with similar assets  including gains or losses upon dispositions of such assets 
our determinations with respect to salvage values are based upon the expected market values of equipment at the end of the expected life 
we presently do not expect any decrease in the salvage values of our revenue equipment as a result of conditions in the used equipment market or otherwise 
tires on revenue equipment purchased are capitalized as a part of the equipment cost and depreciated over the life of the vehicle 
replacement tires and recapping costs are expensed when placed in service 
claims accrual 
reserves and estimates for claims is another of our critical accounting policies 
the primary claims arising for us consist of cargo liability  personal injury  property damage  collision and comprehensive  workers compensation  and employee medical expenses 
we maintain self insurance levels for these various areas of risk and have established reserves to cover these self insured liabilities 
we also maintain insurance to cover liabilities in excess of the self insurance amounts 
the claims reserves represent accruals for the estimated self insured portion of pending claims  including adverse development of known claims  as well as incurred but not reported claims 
these estimates are based on historical information  primarily our own claims experience and the experience of our third party administrator  along with certain assumptions about future events 
changes in assumptions as well as changes in actual experience could cause these estimates to change over time 
the significant level of our self insured retention for personal injury and property damage claims  currently at million  amplifies the importance and potential impact of these estimates 

table of contents accounting for income taxes 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
if it were ever estimated that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets will not be realized  a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that are determined not to be realizable 
a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets has not been deemed necessary due to the company s profitable operations 
accordingly  if the facts or financial results were to change  thereby impacting the likelihood of realizing the deferred tax assets  judgment would have to be applied to determine the amount of valuation allowance required in any given period

 accounting for stock based compensation 
this statement supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related implementation guidance 
sfas no 
revised requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award 
the company expects to adopt the provisions of sfas revised using a modified prospective application 
the modified prospective method requires companies to recognize compensation cost for unvested awards that are outstanding on the effective date based on the fair value that the company had originally estimated for purposes of preparing its sfas pro forma disclosures 
for all new awards that are granted or modified after the effective date  a company would use sfas r s measurement model 
this statement is effective for the company on january  as of december   the amount of unrecognized compensation expense to be recognized in future periods  in accordance with sfas r  is approximately million 
had sfas no 
r been implemented in  we would have experienced a million reduction in our net income and a 
per share decrease in both basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share 
the majority of the stock option expense was due to the one time option grant of  shares to kevin knight  the company s chief executive officer 
this one time grant was made in recognition of mr

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk changes in interest rate on debt and from changes in commodity prices 
under financial accounting reporting release number and sec rules and regulations  we are required to disclose information concerning market risk with respect to foreign exchange rates  interest rates  and commodity prices 
we have elected to make such disclosures  to the extent applicable  using a sensitivity analysis approach  based on hypothetical changes in interest rates and commodity prices 
except as described below  we have not had occasion to use derivative financial instruments for risk management purposes and do not use them for either speculation or trading 
because our operations are confined to the united states  we are not subject to foreign currency risk 
interest rate risk we are subject to interest rate risk to the extent we borrow against our line of credit or incur debt in the acquisition of revenue equipment 
we attempt to manage our interest rate risk by managing the amount of debt we carry 
at december   we did not have any outstanding borrowings 
in the opinion of management  an increase in short term interest rates could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition only if we incur substantial indebtedness and the interest rate increases are not offset by freight rate increases or other items 
management does not foresee or expect in the near future any significant changes in our exposure to interest rate fluctuations or in how that exposure is managed by us 
commodity price risk we also are subject to commodity price risk with respect to purchases of fuel 
historically  we have sought to recover a portion of our short term fuel price increases from customers through fuel surcharges 
fuel surcharges that can be collected do not always fully offset an increase in the cost of diesel fuel 
based upon our experience  we believe that we generally pass through to customers approximately to of fuel price increases 
for the fiscal year ended december   fuel expense  net of fuel surcharge  represented of our total operating expenses  net of fuel surcharge  compared to for the same period ending in
