item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources for a discussion of our credit facility 
a breach of any of these covenants or our inability to comply with the required financial ratios could result in a default under our credit facility  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain the necessary waivers or amendments 
in the event of any default not waived  the lenders under our credit facility are not required to lend any additional amounts to us and could elect to declare all outstanding borrowings  together with accrued interest and other fees  to be immediately due and payable  or require us to apply all of our available cash to repay our borrowings and cash collateralize any outstanding letters of credit at the time of default 
if we are unable to repay borrowings with respect to our credit facility when due  our lenders could proceed against their collateral  which consists of substantially all of our assets  including property  equipment and real estate 
if the indebtedness under our credit facility is accelerated  we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay such indebtedness in full 
as of august   we had million outstanding borrowings under the credit facility with outstanding letters of credit inclusive of both domestic financial and domestic performance of approximately million and indebtedness under our senior notes of million 
in addition  although our senior notes contain no cross default provisions  we have entered into indemnity agreements with our sureties that contain cross default provisions 
accordingly  in the event of a default under our credit facility  we would need to obtain a waiver from our sureties or an amendment to our indemnity agreements 
we cannot assure you that we would be successful in obtaining any such amendment or waiver 
restrictive covenants in our credit facility may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies 
our credit facility restricts on our ability to  among other things incur additional indebtedness or contingent obligations or issue preferred stock  pay dividends or make distributions to our shareholders  repurchase or redeem our capital stock or subordinated indebtedness  make investments  create liens  
table of contents enter into sale leaseback transactions  incur restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to make other payments to us  make capital expenditures  enter into transactions with our shareholders and affiliates  sell and pledge assets  and acquire the assets of  or merge or consolidate with  other companies or transfer all or substantially all of our assets 
our credit facility requires us to maintain certain financial ratios  including a leverage ratio  a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a defined minimum net worth 
we may not be able to satisfy these ratios  especially if our operating results fall below management s expectations 
in addition  in order to remain in compliance with the covenants in our credit facility  we may be limited in our flexibility to take actions resulting in non cash charges  such as settling our claims 
these covenants may impair our ability to engage in favorable business activities and our ability to finance future operations or capital needs 
a breach of any of these covenants or our inability to comply with the required financial ratios could result in a default under our credit facility 
see risk factor  non compliance with covenants in our credit facility  without waiver or amendment from the lenders of the credit facility  could adversely affect our ability to borrow under the credit facility 
our borrowing levels and debt service obligations could adversely affect our financial condition and impair our ability to fulfill our obligations under our senior notes and our credit facility 
as of august   we had total outstanding indebtedness of approximately million  approximately million of which was secured indebtedness  including obligations under capital leases 
in addition  as of august   letters of credit  domestic and foreign  issued for our account in an aggregate amount of million were outstanding and we had borrowings of million under our credit facility 
our indebtedness could have important consequences  including the following it will require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness  which reduces the cash available for other business purposes  it will limit our ability to obtain additional financing and create additional liens on our assets  it will limit our flexibility in planning for  and reacting to  changes in our business  it may place us at a competitive disadvantage if we are more leveraged than our competitors  it may make us more vulnerable to adverse economic and industry conditions  and it may restrict us from making additional investments or acquisitions 
to the extent that new debt is added to our currently anticipated debt levels  the substantial leverage risks described above would increase 
we are currently the subject of an informal inquiry by the sec 
on june   we were notified by the staff of the securities and exchange commission  or sec  that the staff is conducting an informal inquiry relating to our financial statements 
the sec has not advised us as to either the reason for the inquiry or its precise scope 
however  the initial requests for information we received appear to 
table of contents primarily relate to the purchase method of accounting for various acquisitions 
we have been cooperating with the sec  including providing documents and responding to requests for voluntary production  as well as conducting a detailed review of our accounting for our acquisitions 
subsequent to an internal review which led to the restatement of our financial statements for the second quarter of  as reflected in a press release we announced on july   with a current report on form k  the sec also requested information related to the restatement 
this included information regarding the clerical error in the computation of the amount of revenue recognized on a construction contract and the misapplication of gaap in our accounting for a minority interest in a joint venture 
the sec s review may have additional consequences independent of the inquiry  including further restatement of our financial results for past periods 
in addition  if the sec takes further action  it may escalate the informal inquiry into a formal investigation  which may result in an enforcement action or other legal proceedings against us and potentially members of our management 
responding to such actions or proceedings have been and could continue to be costly and could divert the efforts and attention of our management team  including senior officers 
if any such action or proceeding is resolved unfavorably to us or any of them  we or they could be subject to injunctions  fines  increased review and scrutiny by regulatory authorities and other penalties or sanctions  including criminal sanctions  that could materially and adversely affect our business operations  financial performance  liquidity and future prospects and materially adversely affect the trading market and price of our stock 
any unfavorable actions could also result in private civil actions  loss of key personnel or other adverse consequences 
lawsuits and regulatory proceedings could adversely affect our business 
from time to time  our directors and certain of our current and former officers are named as a party to lawsuits and regulatory proceedings 
a discussion of these lawsuits appears in note of our consolidated financial statements 
although it is not possible at this early stage to predict the likely outcome of these actions  an adverse result in any of these lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on us 
litigation can involve complex factual and legal questions and its outcome is uncertain 
any claim that is successfully asserted against us could result in significant damage claims and other losses 
even if we were to prevail  any litigation could be costly and time consuming and would divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations  which could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
see notes and to our consolidated financial statements in this report 
downgrades by rating agencies may require us to modify existing bonding facilities or obtain new bonding facilities 
in the event our debt ratings are lowered by moody s investors service or standards and poor s it might be more difficult for us to obtain surety bonding for new projects in the future  and we may be required to increase or provide cash collateral to obtain these surety bonds  which would reduce our available cash or availability under our credit facility 
any new or modified bonding facilities might not be on terms as attractive as those we have currently and we could also be subject to increased costs of capital and interest rates 
the nature of our contracts could adversely affect us 
approximately of our backlog as of august  was from cost reimbursable contracts and the remaining was from fixed price contracts 
revenues and gross profit from cost reimbursable  long term contracts can be significantly affected by contract incentives penalties that may not be known or finalized until the later stages of the contract term 
a significant number of our domestic piping contracts  and substantially all of our international piping contracts  are fixed price 
in addition  a number of the contracts we assumed in the stone webster and it group acquisitions were fixed price contracts  and we will continue to enter into these types of contracts in the future 
under fixed price contracts  we agree to perform the contract for a fixed price and  as a result  benefit from costs savings and earnings from approved change orders  but we are generally unable to recover any cost overruns to the approved contract price 
under maximum price contracts  we share with the customer any savings up to a negotiated or target ceiling 
when costs exceed the negotiated ceiling price  we may be required to reduce our fee or to absorb some or all of the cost overruns 
contract prices are established based  in part  on cost estimates that are subject to a number of assumptions  including assumptions regarding future economic conditions 
if these estimates prove inaccurate or circumstances change  cost overruns could have a material adverse effect on our business and results 
table of contents of our operations 
our profit for these projects could decrease or we could experience losses if we are unable to secure fixed pricing commitments from our suppliers at the time the contracts are entered into or if we experience cost increases for material or labor during the performance of the contracts 
we enter into contractual agreements with customers for some of our engineering  procurement and construction services to be performed based on agreed upon reimbursable costs and labor rates 
some of these contracts provide for the customer s review of the accounting and cost control systems to verify the completeness and accuracy of the reimbursable costs invoiced 
these reviews could result in reductions in reimbursable costs and labor rates previously billed to the customer 
many of our contracts require us to satisfy specified design  engineering  procurement or construction milestones in order to receive payment for the work completed or equipment or supplies procured prior to achievement of the applicable milestone 
as a result  under these types of arrangements  we may incur significant costs or perform significant amounts of services prior to receipt of payment 
if the customer determines not to proceed with the completion of the project or if the customer defaults on its payment obligations  we may face difficulties in collecting payment of amounts due to us for the costs previously incurred or for the amounts previously expended to purchase equipment or supplies 
in addition  many of our customers for large epc projects are project specific entities that do not have significant assets other than their interests in the epc project 
it may be difficult for us to collect amounts owed to us by these customers against the customer s more credit worthy parent company 
if we are unable to collect amounts owed to us for these matters  we may be required to record a charge against earnings related to the project which could result in a material loss 
we are subject to the risks associated with being a government contractor 
we are a major provider of services to governmental agencies and therefore are exposed to risks associated with government contracting  including reductions in government spending  cancelled or delayed appropriations specific to our projects  heightened competition and modified or terminated contracts  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
for the year ended august   of backlog was generated from us governmental agencies 
legislatures typically appropriate funds on a year by year basis  while contract performance may take more than one year 
as a result  contracts may be only partially funded  and we may not realize all of our potential revenues and profits from our contracts 
appropriations  and the timing of payment  may be influenced by  among other things  the state of the economy  competing political priorities  curtailments in the use of government contracting firms  budget constraints  the timing and amount of tax receipts and the overall level of government expenditures 
government customers typically can terminate or modify contracts with us at their convenience 
as a result  our backlog may be reduced or we may incur a loss 
as a result of our government contracting business  we are the subject of audits  cost reviews and investigations by contracting oversight agencies 
during the course of an audit  the oversight agency may disallow costs 
such cost disallowances may result in adjustments to previously reported revenues 
in addition  our failure to comply with the terms of one or more of our government contracts  other government agreements  or government regulations and statutes could result in our being suspended or barred from future government projects for a significant period of time and possible civil or criminal fines and penalties and the risk of public scrutiny of our performance which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our failure to meet schedule or performance requirements of our contracts could adversely affect us 
in certain circumstances  we guarantee facility completion by a scheduled acceptance date or achievement of certain acceptance and performance testing levels 
failure to meet any such schedule or performance requirements could result in additional costs  and the amount of such additional costs could exceed projected profits 
these additional costs include liquidated damages paid under contractual penalty provisions  which can be substantial and can accrue on a daily basis 
in addition  our actual costs could exceed our projections 
performance problems for existing and future contracts could cause actual results of operations to differ materially from those anticipated by us and could cause us to suffer damage to our reputation within our industry and our client base 
for examples of the kinds of claims which may result from liquidated damages provisions and cost overruns  see note of our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents our dependence on subcontractors and equipment manufacturers could expose us to the risk of loss 
we rely on third party equipment manufacturers as well as third party subcontractors to complete our projects 
to the extent that we cannot engage subcontractors or acquire equipment or materials  our ability to complete a project in a timely fashion or at a profit may be impaired 
if the amount we are required to pay for these goods and services exceeds the amount we have estimated in bidding for fixed price work  we could experience losses in the performance of these contracts 
in addition  if a subcontractor or a manufacturer is unable to deliver its services  equipment or materials according to the negotiated terms for any reason  including the deterioration of its financial condition  we may be required to purchase the services  equipment or materials from another source at a higher price 
this may reduce the profit to be realized or result in a loss on a project for which the services  equipment or materials were needed 
possible cost escalation associated with our fixed price contracts could negatively affect our profitability 
we estimate total contract costs in pricing our fixed price contracts by incorporating assumptions to address inflation and fluctuations in market price for materials 
however  we can not predict these variable components with certainty 
as a result  we may incur total costs that exceed original estimates due to increased materials  labor or other costs  which could contribute to a lower than expected return or losses on our projects that are not governed by escalation clauses 
our results of operations depend on new contract awards and the timing for performing these contracts 
a substantial portion of our revenues is directly or indirectly derived from large scale domestic and international projects 
it is difficult to predict whether and when we will receive such awards due to the lengthy and complex bidding and selection process  which is affected by a number of factors  such as market conditions  financing arrangements  governmental approvals and environmental matters 
because a significant portion of our revenues is generated from large projects  our results of operations and cash flows can fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending on the timing of our contract awards 
in addition  many of these contracts are subject to financing contingencies and  as a result  we are subject to the risk that the customer will not be able to secure the necessary financing for the project 
our ability to obtain adequate bonding and  as a result  to bid on new work could have a material adverse effect on our future revenues and business prospects 
in certain circumstances  customers may require us to provide credit enhancements  including bonds or letters of credit 
in line with industry practice  we are often required to provide performance and surety bonds to customers 
these bonds indemnify the customer if we fail to perform our obligations under the contract 
if a bond is required for a particular project and we are unable to obtain an appropriate bond  we cannot pursue that project 
we have a bonding facility but  as is typically the case  the issuance of bonds under that facility is at the surety s sole discretion 
moreover  due to events that affect the insurance and bonding markets generally  bonding may be more difficult to obtain in the future or may only be available at significant additional cost 
there can be no assurance that bonds will continue to be available to us on reasonable terms 
the uncertainty of our contract award timing can also present difficulties in matching workforce size with contract needs 
in some cases  we maintain and bear the cost of a ready workforce that is larger than called for under existing contracts in anticipation of future workforce needs for expected contract awards 
if an expected contract award is delayed or not received  we could incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on us 
further  our significant customers vary between years  and the loss of any one or more of our key customers could have a material adverse impact on us 

table of contents our environmental and infrastructure operations may subject us to potential contractual and operational costs and liabilities 
many of our e i segment customers attempt to shift financial and operating risks to the contractor  particularly on projects involving large scale cleanups and or projects where there may be a risk that the contamination could be more extensive or difficult to resolve than previously anticipated 
in this competitive market  customers pressure contractors to accept greater risks of performance  liability for damage or injury to third parties or property and liability for fines and penalties 
prior to our acquisition of the it group  the it group was involved in claims and litigation involving disputes over such issues 
therefore  it is possible that we could also become involved in similar claims and litigation in the future as a result of our acquisition of the assets of it group and our participation in separate environmental and infrastructure contracts 
environmental management contractors also potentially face liabilities to third parties for property damage or personal injury stemming from exposure to or a release of toxic  hazardous or radioactive substances resulting from a project performed for customers 
these liabilities could arise long after completion of a project 
although the risks we face in our anthrax and other biological agent work are similar to those faced in our toxic chemical emergency response business  the risks posed by attempting to detect and remediate these biological agents may include risks to our employees  subcontractors and others may be affected should our detection and remediation prove less effective than anticipated 
because anthrax and similar contamination is so recent  there may be unknown risks involved  and in some circumstances  there may be no types of standard protocols for dealing with these risks 
the risks we face with respect to biological agents may also include the potential ineffectiveness of developing technologies to detect and remediate the contamination  claims for infringement of these technologies  difficulties in working with the smaller  specialized firms that may own these technologies and have detection and remediation capabilities  our ability to attract and retain qualified employees and subcontractors in light of these risks  the high profile nature of the work and the potential unavailability of insurance and indemnification 
we are exposed to certain risks associated with our integrated environmental solutions businesses 
certain subsidiaries within our e i division are engaged in two similar programs that may involve assumption of a client s environmental remediation obligations and potential claim obligations 
one program involves our subsidiary  the landbank group  inc  landbank  which was acquired in the it group acquisition 
under this program  landbank purchases and then remediates and or takes other steps to improve environmentally impaired properties 
the second program is operated by our subsidiary  shaw environmental liability solutions  llc  which contractually assumes responsibility for environmental matters at a particular site or sites and provides indemnifications for defined cleanup costs and post closing third party claims in return for compensation by the client 
these subsidiaries may operate and or purchase and redevelop environmentally impaired property 
as the owner or operator of such properties  we may be required to clean up all contamination at these sites even if we did not place the contamination there 
while we attempt to reduce our exposure to unplanned risks through the performance of environmental due diligence  the use of liability protection provisions of federal laws like the brownfields revitalization act and similar state laws and the purchase of environmental and cost cap insurance coverage or other risk management products  we cannot assure you that our risk management strategies and these products and laws will adequately protect us in all circumstances or that no material adverse impact will occur 
our ability to be profitable in this type of business also depends on our ability to accurately estimate cleanup costs 
while we engage in comprehensive engineering and cost analyses  if we materially underestimate the required cost of cleanup at a particular project  underestimation could significantly adversely affect us 
further  the continued growth of this type of business is dependent upon the availability of environmental and cost cap insurance or other risk management products 
we cannot be assured or provide assurance that such products will continue to be available to us in the future or  if it is available  at an economically feasible cost 
moreover  environmental laws and regulations governing the cleanup of contaminated sites are constantly changing 
we cannot predict the effect of future changes to these laws and regulations on our landbank and environmental liability solutions businesses 
additionally  when we purchase real estate in this business  we are subject to many of the same risks as real estate developers  including the timely receipt of building and zoning permits  construction delays  the ability of markets to absorb new development projects  market fluctuations and the ability to obtain additional equity or debt financing on satisfactory terms  among others 

table of contents the limitation or the modification of the price anderson act s indemnification authority could adversely affect our business 
the price anderson act paa comprehensively regulates the manufacture  use and storage of radioactive materials  while promoting the nuclear energy industry by offering broad indemnification to nuclear energy plant operators and doe contractors 
because we provide services for the doe relating to its nuclear weapons facilities and the nuclear energy industry in the ongoing maintenance and modification  as well as decontamination and decommissioning  of its nuclear energy plants  we are entitled to the indemnification protections under the paa 
although the paa s indemnification provisions are broad  it does not apply to all liabilities that we might incur while performing services as a radioactive materials cleanup contractor for the doe and the nuclear energy industry 
if the indemnification authority is not applicable  our business could be adversely affected by either a refusal of operations of new facilities to retain us or our inability to obtain commercially adequate insurance and indemnification 
environmental factors and changes in laws and regulations could increase our costs and liabilities and affect the demand for our services 
in addition to the environmental risks described above relating to the businesses acquired from it group and our environmental remediation business  our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations  including those concerning emissions into the air  discharges into waterways  generation  storage  handling  treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes  and health and safety 
our projects often involve highly regulated materials  including hazardous and nuclear materials and wastes 
environmental laws and regulations generally impose limitations and standards for regulated materials and require us to obtain a permit and comply with various other requirements 
the improper characterization  handling  or disposal of regulated materials or any other failure to comply with federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations or associated environmental permits may result in the assessment of administrative  civil and criminal penalties  the imposition of investigatory or remedial obligations  or the issuance of injunctions that could restrict or prevent our ability to perform under existing contracts 
in addition  under cercla and comparable state laws  we may be required to investigate and remediate regulated materials 
cercla and comparable state laws typically impose joint and several liability without regard to whether a company knew of or caused the release of the materials  and liability for the entire cost of clean up can be imposed upon any responsible party 
the principal federal environmental  health and safety legislation affecting our operations and the operations of our clients include the national environmental policy act  the rcra  the clean air act  the occupational safety and health act  the toxic substances control act  the federal water pollution control act  cercla  and the superfund amendments and reauthorization act  as each has been amended from time to time 
our foreign operations are also subject to similar governmental controls and restrictions relating to environmental protection 
we could also incur environmental liability at sites where we have been hired by potentially responsible parties prps to remediate contamination of the site 
such prps have sought to expand the reach of cercla  rcra and similar state statutes to make the remediation contractor responsible for cleanup costs 
these companies claim that environmental contractors are owners or operators of hazardous waste facilities or that the contractors arranged for treatment  transportation or disposal of hazardous substances 
if we are held responsible under cercla or rcra for damages caused while performing services or otherwise  we may be forced to incur cleanup costs directly  notwithstanding the potential availability of contribution or indemnification from other parties 
over the past several years  the epa and other federal agencies have significantly constricted the circumstances under which they will indemnify their contractors against liabilities incurred in connection with the investigation and remediation of contaminated properties under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  as amended  or cercla  and similar projects 

table of contents the environmental  health and safety laws and regulations to which we are subject are constantly changing  and it is impossible to predict the effect of any future changes to these laws and regulations on us 
we do not yet know the full extent  if any  of environmental liabilities associated with many of our recently acquired properties undergoing or scheduled to undergo site restoration  as well as any liabilities associated with the assets we acquired from stone webster and it group 
we cannot assure you that our operations will continue to comply with future laws and regulations and that such noncompliance would not significantly adversely affect us 
the level of enforcement of these laws and regulations also affects the demand for many of our services 
the perception that enforcement of current environmental laws and regulations has been reduced has decreased the demand for some services 
future changes to environmental  health and safety laws and regulations or to enforcement of those laws and regulations could result in increased or decreased demand for some of our services 
the ultimate impact of the proposed changes will depend upon a number of factors  including the overall strength of the economy and clients views on the cost effectiveness of remedies available under the changed laws and regulations 
if proposed or enacted changes materially reduce demand for our environmental services  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
development and construction risks and other risks associated with our military family housing privatization contracts could impact our profitability and a loss of our investment 
development and construction activities conducted through various joint ventures with one strategic partner expose us to risks including our ability to obtain necessary permitting  land use  building  occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations on a timely basis  which could result in increased development costs  the incurrence of construction costs related to new construction or renovations that exceed original estimates due to increased materials  labor or other costs  which costs could contribute to a lower than expected return  our ability to complete construction of a property on schedule and meet financial goals for development  and the incurrence of higher construction costs or experience in project delays if we are not successful in forming strategic alliances with key material suppliers and vendors 
other risks directly associated with our dependence on the us military include our ability to obtain the necessary levels of occupancy and rents  which could result in lower than expected returns and in some cases losses 
rents are determined by congress annually through appropriations for basic allowance for housing bah for all of the branches of the us military 
we cannot be assured that the appropriations each year will occur on a timely basis  or that the amount of bah appropriations will be sufficient to keep up with escalations in the cost of living expenses 
congress may change the law and the dod can revise its procedures at any time 
we cannot be assured that such changes will not be made and  if changes are made  such changes may have a material adverse effect on the level of our income generated by our privatization projects  if rental income is not sufficient to cover project debt service requirements the joint venture may need to supplement income from fees or other sources 
our ability to guarantee the military bases where we have military family housing projects will remain active or that their functions and or staffing levels will not be materially reduced such that we will be unable to lease military family housing units to members of the us military 
the dod has  from time to time  closed military bases and realigned and or reduced the functions and staffing levels at certain bases under the base realignment and closure brac initiative 
ultimately  these risks could have an adverse effect on our profitability and expose us to possible losses as well as the loss of our investment in these military family housing privatizations 
during fiscal  we contributed million to these housing privatizations 

table of contents our working capital requirements may increase as a result of our work associated with the military family housing privatization market 
these privatization contracts require initial capital contributions in the early stages of the project and ultimately permanent financing from a third party lender 
as of august   we were not scheduled to make any significant equity contributions during fiscal in addition  because occupancy rates and rents at a newly developed property may fluctuate depending on a number of factors  including market and economic conditions  we may be unable to meet our profitability goals for that property 
if our partners fail to perform their contractual obligations on a project  we could be exposed to loss of reputation and additional financial performance obligations that could result in reduced profits or  in some cases  significant losses 
we often enter into various joint ventures as part of our environmental and engineering  procurement and construction businesses so that we can jointly bid and perform on a particular project 
the success of these and other joint ventures depends  in large part  on the satisfactory performance of the contractual obligations of our joint venture partners 
if our partners do not meet their obligations  the joint venture may be unable to adequately perform and deliver its contracted services 
under these circumstances  we may be required to make additional investments and provide additional services to ensure the adequate performance and delivery of the contracted services 
these additional obligations could result in reduced profits or  in some cases  significant losses for us with respect to the joint venture  which could also affect our reputation in the industries we serve 
our dependence on one or a few customers could adversely affect us 
due to the size of many engineering and construction projects  one or a few clients have historically and may in the future  contributed to a substantial portion of our consolidated revenues 
for example  in fiscal  approximately of our revenues were generated from major customers  including governments 
similarly  our backlog frequently reflects multiple projects for individual clients  therefore  one major customer may comprise a significant percentage of our backlog at a point in time 
backlog from the us government or us government owned entities accounted for of backlog at august  because these significant customers generally contract with us for specific projects  we may lose these customers from year to year as their projects with us are completed 
if we do not replace them with other customers or other projects  our business could be materially adversely affected 
additionally  we have long standing relationships with many significant customers  including customers with which we have alliance agreements that have preferred pricing arrangements 
however  our contracts with these customers are on a project by project basis  and they may unilaterally reduce or discontinue their purchases at any time 
the loss of business from any one of such customers could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations 
if we experience delays and or defaults in customer payments  we could be unable to recover all expenditures 
because of the nature of our contracts  at times we commit resources to projects prior to receiving payments from the customer in amounts sufficient to cover expenditures on projects as they are incurred 
delays in customer payments may require us to make a working capital investment 
if a customer defaults in making its payments on a project in which we have devoted significant resources  it could have a material negative effect on our results of operations 
our projects expose us to potential professional liability  product liability  warranty and other claims 
we engineer  construct and perform services in large industrial facilities in which accidents or system failures can be disastrous 
any catastrophic occurrences in excess of insurance limits at locations engineered or constructed by us or where our products are installed or services performed could result in significant professional liability  product liability  warranty and other claims against us 
in addition  under some of our contracts  we must use new metals or processes for producing or fabricating pipe for our customers 
the failure of any of these metals or processes could result in warranty claims against us for significant replacement or reworking costs 

table of contents further  the engineering and construction projects we perform expose us to additional risks including cost overruns  equipment failures  personal injuries  property damage  shortages of materials and labor  work stoppages  labor disputes  weather problems and unforeseen engineering  architectural  environmental and geological problems 
in addition  once our construction is complete  we may face claims with respect to the performance of these facilities 
we face substantial competition in each of our business segments 
in our e i segment  we compete with a diverse array of small and large organizations  including national and regional environmental management firms  national  regional and local architectural  engineering and construction firms  environmental management divisions or subsidiaries of international engineering  construction and systems companies  and waste generators that have developed in house capabilities 
increased competition in this business  combined with changes in client procurement procedures  has resulted in changes in the industry  including among other things  lower contract profits  more fixed price or unit price contracts and contract terms that may increasingly require us to indemnify our clients against damages or injuries to third parties and property and environmental fines and penalties 
we believe  therefore  these market conditions may require us to accept more contractual and performance risk than we have historically accepted for the environmental and infrastructure segment to be competitive 
the entry of large systems contractors and international engineering and construction firms into the environmental services industry has increased competition for major federal government contracts and programs  which have been a primary source of revenue in recent years for our e i business 
there can be no assurance that our e i segment will be able to compete successfully 
in our e c and maintenance segments  we face competition from numerous regional  national and international competitors  many of which have greater financial and other resources than we do 
our competitors include well established  well financed concerns  both privately and publicly held  including many major energy equipment manufacturers and engineering and construction companies  some engineering companies  internal engineering departments at utilities and certain of our customers 
the markets that we serve require substantial resources and particularly highly skilled and experienced technical personnel 
in our f m segment  we face substantial competition on a domestic and international level 
in the us  there are a number of smaller pipe fabricators 
internationally  our principal competitors are divisions of large industrial firms 
some of our competitors  primarily in the international sector  have greater financial and other resources than we do 
political and economic conditions in foreign countries in which we operate could adversely affect us 
approximately of our fiscal revenues were attributable to projects in international markets  some of which are subject to political unrest and uncertainty 
the services we provide to our customers in iraq and other middle east countries have created several challenges  including identifying and retaining the appropriate subcontractors  the recruiting of qualified personnel and the ability to retain them  the safety of our employees and subcontractors and the increased working capital demands 
it is possible that our employees may suffer injury or death  repatriation problems or other unforeseen costs and risks in the course of their international projects  which could negatively impact our operations 
in addition to the specific challenges we face in the middle east  international contracts  operations and expansion expose us to risks inherent in doing business outside the us  including uncertain economic conditions in the foreign countries in which we make capital investments  operate and sell products and services  the lack of well developed legal systems and less established or traditional business practices in some countries in which we operate and sell products and services  which could make it difficult for us to enforce our contractual rights  
table of contents security and safety of employees  expropriation of property  restrictions on the right to convert or repatriate currency  political risks  including risks of loss due to civil strife  acts of war  guerrilla activities and insurrection  greater risk of uncollectible accounts and longer collection cycles  currency fluctuations  logistical and communications challenges  potential adverse changes in laws and regulatory practices  including export license requirements  trade barriers  tariffs and tax laws  changes in labor conditions  exposure to liability under the foreign corrupt practices act  and general economic and political conditions in foreign markets 
work stoppages and other labor problems could adversely affect us 
some of our employees in the us and abroad are represented by labor unions 
a lengthy strike or other work stoppage at any of our facilities could have a material adverse effect on us 
from time to time  we have also experienced attempts to unionize our non union shops 
while these efforts have achieved limited success to date  we cannot give any assurance that we will not experience additional union activity in the future 
because of the capital intensive nature of our business  we are vulnerable to reductions in our liquidity 
our operations could require us to utilize large sums of working capital  sometimes on short notice and sometimes without assurance of recovery of the expenditures 
circumstances or events could create large cash outflows include losses resulting from fixed price contracts  environmental liabilities  litigation risks  unexpected costs or losses resulting from acquisitions  contract initiation or completion delays  political conditions  customer payment problems  foreign exchange risks  professional and product liability claims  among others 
we cannot provide assurance that we will have sufficient liquidity or the credit capacity to meet all of our cash needs if we encounter significant working capital requirements as a result of these or other factors 
insufficient liquidity could have important consequences to us 
for example  we could have less operating flexibility due to restrictions which could be imposed by our creditors  including restrictions on incurring additional debt  creating liens on our properties and paying dividends  have less success in obtaining new work if our sureties or our lenders were to limit our ability to provide new performance bonds or letters of credit for our projects  be required to dedicate a substantial portion of cash flows from operations to the repayment of debt and the interest associated with that debt  fail to comply with the terms of our credit facility  incur increased lending fees  costs and interest rates  and experience difficulty in financing future acquisitions and or continuing operations 

table of contents foreign exchange risks may affect our ability to realize a profit from certain projects or to obtain projects 
we generally attempt to denominate our contracts in us dollars 
however  from time to time we enter into contracts denominated in a foreign currency 
this practice subjects us to foreign exchange risks  particularly to the extent contract revenues are denominated in a currency different than the contract costs 
we attempt to minimize our exposure from foreign exchange risks by obtaining escalation provisions for projects in inflationary economies  matching the contract revenues currency with the contract costs currency or entering into hedge contracts when there are different currencies for contract revenues and costs 
however  these actions will not always eliminate all foreign exchange risks 
foreign exchange controls may also adversely affect us 
for instance  foreign exchange controls were instituted in venezuela on february  these controls may limit our ability to repatriate profits from our venezuelan subsidiaries or otherwise convert local currency into us dollars 
further  our ability to obtain international contracts is impacted by the relative strength or weakness of the us dollar to foreign currencies 
we may incur unexpected liabilities associated with the stone webster and it group acquisitions  as well as other acquisitions 
in july  we acquired substantially all of the operating assets and assumed certain liabilities of stone webster  inc  and during fiscal  we acquired substantially all of the operating assets and assumed certain liabilities of the it group  inc we believe  pursuant to the terms of the agreements for the stone webster and it group asset acquisitions that we assumed only certain liabilities specified in those agreements 
in addition  those agreements provide that certain other liabilities  including but not limited to  certain outstanding borrowings  certain leases  certain contracts in process  completed contracts  claims or litigation that relate to acts or events occurring prior to the acquisition date  and certain employee benefit obligations are specifically excluded from our transactions 
there can be no assurance  however  that we do not have any exposure related to the excluded liabilities 
in addition  some of the former owners of companies we have acquired are contractually required to indemnify us against liabilities related to the operation of their companies before we acquired them and for misrepresentations made by them in connection with the acquisitions 
in some cases  these former owners may not have the financial ability to meet their indemnification responsibilities 
if this occurs  we may incur unexpected liabilities 
any of these unexpected liabilities could have a material adverse effect on us and our financial condition 
if we write off a significant amount of intangible assets or long lived assets  our earnings will be negatively impacted 
because we have grown in part through acquisitions  goodwill and other acquired intangible assets represent a substantial portion of our assets 
goodwill was approximately million as of august  if we make additional acquisitions  it is likely that we will record additional intangible assets on our books 
we also have long lived assets consisting of property and equipment and other identifiable intangible assets of million as of august   which are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if a determination that a significant impairment in value of our unamortized intangible assets or long lived assets occurs  that determination would require us to write off a substantial portion of our assets and would negatively affect our earnings 
difficulties integrating our acquisitions could adversely affect us 
from time to time  we acquire businesses and assets to pursue market opportunities  increase our existing capabilities and expand into new areas of operation 
we plan to pursue select acquisitions in the future 
if we are unable to complete acquisitions we have identified  our business could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  we may encounter difficulties integrating our future acquisitions and in successfully managing the growth we expect from the acquisitions 
in addition  our expansion into new business areas may expose us to additional business risks that are different from those we have traditionally experienced 
to the extent we encounter problems in identifying acquisition risks or integrating our acquisitions  we could be materially adversely affected 
because we may pursue acquisitions globally and may actively pursue a number of opportunities simultaneously  we may encounter unforeseen expenses  complications and delays  including difficulties in employing sufficient staff and maintaining operational and management oversight 

table of contents our failure to attract and retain qualified personnel  including key officers  could have an adverse effect on us 
our ability to attract and retain qualified engineers  scientists and other professional personnel in accordance with our needs  either through direct hiring or acquisition of other firms employing such professionals  is an important factor in determining our future success 
the market for these professionals is competitive  and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to attract and retain needed professionals 
in addition  our ability to be successful depends in part on our ability to attract and retain skilled laborers and craftsmen in our pipe fabrication and construction businesses 
demand for these workers can at times be high and the supply extremely limited 
our success is also highly dependent upon the continued services of our key officers 
the loss of any of our key officers could adversely affect us 
we do not maintain key employee insurance on any of our executive officers 
changes in technology could adversely affect us  and our competitors may develop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology 
we believe that we are an industry leader in the design and construction of ethylene processing plants 
we protect our position through patent registrations  license restrictions and a research and development program 
however  it is possible that others may develop competing processes that could negatively affect our market position 
additionally  we have developed construction and energy generation and transmission software that we believe provide competitive advantages 
the advantages currently provided by this software could be at risk if competitors were to develop superior or comparable technologies 
our induction pipe bending technology and capabilities favorably influence our ability to compete successfully 
currently this technology and our proprietary software are not patented 
even though we have some legal protections against the dissemination of this know how  including non disclosure and confidentiality agreements  our efforts to prevent others from using our technology could be time consuming  expensive  and ultimately may be unsuccessful or only partially successful 
finally  there is nothing to prevent our competitors from independently attempting to develop or obtain access to technologies that are similar or superior to our technology 
if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls  we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud 
as a result  investors could lose confidence in our financial reporting  which would harm our business and the trading price of our stock 
effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud 
if we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud  our operating results could be harmed 
we devote significant attention to establishing and maintaining effective internal controls 
implementing any appropriate changes to our internal controls  if ever required  may require specific compliance training of our directors  officers  and employees  entail substantial costs in order to modify our existing accounting systems  and take a significant period of time to complete 
we cannot be certain that these measures  if ever required  would ensure that we implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial reporting processes and related section reporting requirements if changes are made 
any failure to implement required new or improved controls or difficulties encountered in their implementation could affect our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations in future periods 
ineffective internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information  which could have a negative effect on the market price of our stock 
terrorists actions have and could continue to negatively impact the us economy and the markets in which we operate 
terrorist attacks like those that occurred on september   have contributed to economic instability in the us  and further acts of terrorism  violence  or war could affect the markets in which we operate  our business  and our expectations 
there can be no assurance that armed hostilities will not increase or that terrorist attacks  or responses from the us  will not lead to further acts of terrorism and civil disturbances in the us or elsewhere  which may further contribute to economic instability in the us these attacks or armed conflicts may directly impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers and could impact our domestic or international revenues  our supply chain  our production capability and our ability to deliver our products and services to our customers 
political and economic instability in some regions of the world may also result and could negatively impact our business 
other risks may negatively affect our business 
our ability to obtain surety bonds or other means of credit support for our projects  our ability to collateralize letters of credit or surety bonds upon non compliance with covenants in our credit facility or indemnity agreements  general economic conditions  future changes in accounting standards or interpretations  provisions in articles of incorporation and by laws and rights agreement could make it more difficult to acquire us and may reduce the market price of our common stock  market prices of our equity securities have changed significantly and could change further  recent changes in accounting for equity related compensation could impact our financial statements and our ability to attract and retain key employees  increases in employee related costs and expenses  including healthcare and other employee benefits such as unemployment insurance and workers compensation  unavoidable delays due to weather conditions  closing of any us military bases related to our privatization interests  and our dependency on technology in our operations and the possible impact of system and information technology interruptions 
all or any of these matters could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors with more liquidity and could have a negative impact upon our financial condition and results of operations

fiscal compared to fiscal restated the explanatory statement on page of this report and notes and to our consolidated financial statements in item of the report address the restatement of our financial statements for fiscal years and executive summary the need for disaster relief  emergency response and recovery services in the gulf coast area of the us as a result of hurricanes katrina and rita  increased activity in the energy markets  consistent demand for clean air and fuels  garrison support services and transmission and distribution services have contributed to our overall revenue growth for the fiscal year ended august  gross profit for the fiscal year ended august   increased compared to the same period for fiscal primarily due to increased work in our e i segment driven by disaster relief  emergency response and recovery services in the gulf coast area of the us our maintenance and f m segments also experienced increases in gross profit in as compared to resulting from increased volume of capital construction services for chemical industry customers and growth in worldwide demand for piping systems  respectively 
the e c segment s gross profit declined  primarily due to estimated cost increases on certain refinery projects and on one power project and the unfavorable ruling on litigation related to our wolf hollow project 
general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  during fiscal compared to fiscal in order to support the increased revenue base and level of business activity 
despite the increase in g a expenses  g a expenses as a percentage of revenues was for fiscal compared to for fiscal specific items that contributed to the increase in g a expenses during fiscal included increased labor costs due to higher headcount primarily in accounting and finance  corporate functional and business development personnel  increasing professional fees for audit and legal services related to the sec informal inquiry and other business agreements  and hurricane related costs 
also contributing to higher g a in were our expensing of previously deferred third party financing costs and certain due diligence costs related to the proposed acquisition of a controlling interest in westinghouse electric company and an increase in employee compensation expense for the cost of stock options now accounted for under sfas r 

table of contents other expenses decreased due to lower interest expenses and the million loss on retirement of our senior notes during fiscal our effective tax rate decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal  primarily due to a million increase in the deferred tax valuation allowance in fiscal  which was reversed in related to uk net operating losses 
minority interest expense increased million primarily due to the change in accounting as a result of the previously described misapplication of gaap and to the consolidation of a previously unconsolidated entity due to our acquisition of one of our joint venture partners 
as a result of all the above  income from continuing operations increased by million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal industry trends the hurricane season resulted in increased spending in our fiscal by fema and other governmental agencies on hurricane relief efforts in the areas affected 
we participated extensively by performing over billion in hurricane projects in fiscal compared to million in spending on hurricane relief efforts and by our other major governmental clients has declined from the levels we experienced in the first half of fiscal and is expected to contribute significantly less to revenues in fiscal as a result of the nominal hurricane activity experienced in the storm season 
the safe  accountable  flexible and efficient transportation equity act a legacy for users safetea lu  enacted in  dedicates appropriations of over billion to federal highway  transit and safety programs  and shaw is well positioned to work in concert with public agencies at federal  state and local levels to accomplish the large and complex infrastructure projects that will receive funding under safetea lu 
there is funding earmarked for emergency relief repairs resulting from natural disasters  for regional programs targeting areas where e i has a presence and for corridor  border and port infrastructure improvement and enhanced homeland security projects of national interest 
by working within a public private partnership framework  e i has the opportunity to pursue contracts important to our business  while at the same time allowing public infrastructure improvement objectives to move forward 
the safetea lu funding  which will continue through  creates strong business opportunities and e i is prepared to leverage our historic capabilities as well as strengthen our developing homeland security services in the areas of ports  cargo and transportation security in a market where demand for infrastructure services has the potential to grow 
power demand is generally dependent on economic growth  therefore  continued spending in the power generation sector has increased 
the growth is coming from companies spending on scrubber retrofit in order to comply with new emission standards introduced in as well as from the upgrade and expansion of t d grid 
although a few utilities have already announced plans to invest in new power generation facilities  there is a lengthy decision and approval process 
the mid to long term prospects for capital expenditures in utilities will be dictated by large investments in new power plants 
a significant economic slowdown in the us or in other key international markets would negatively impact long term power projects 
projected capital spending growth in the chemical sector is primarily driven by capacity additions in china and the middle east 
chemical sector capital spending has increased as a result of rising demand and prices  and chemical producers have been directing more funds for internal growth through capacity expansion 
the majority of the new plants are being built in developing countries such as china to meet increasing local demand 
the middle east is another area of growth due to cheap feed stock 
chemical spending in the us has also been solid  albeit the capacity increase was on a much smaller scale 
a significant economic slowdown in the us or in other key international markets could lead to private clients cutting costs and termination of proposed and or existing projects 
a higher share of fixed price contracts and exposure to contracts in high risk geographical areas could impact revenue growth and gross profit 
oil prices also have an impact on the level of engineering and construction services provided to oil and gas infrastructure development 
a sustained high oil price environment can lead to increased capital spending from oil companies 
we may benefit from rising oil company capital expenditures and a capacity constrained market 
additionally  with natural gas prices relatively high  us utilities are increasingly planning to build new coal fired power plants with clean air scrubbers from which we may benefit as well 

table of contents segment analysis e i segment we provided disaster relief  emergency response and recovery services to federal  state and local governmental entities as well as to not for profit and private entities in the hurricane damaged areas of the united states gulf coast 
each of our segments contributed management  personnel and use of assets to help meet the needs of this work 
however  because emergency response and governmental services are contracted through our e i segment  all revenues and costs are included in our e i segment 
revenues the increases in revenues of million or for fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to increases in project revenues of million associated with providing hurricane recovery and restoration work during fiscal  revenues of million from two recently consolidated joint ventures providing services to the us department of energy  and increases in environmental and logistic support services for the us government customers of million 
the increase in revenues for fiscal was partially offset by decreases in revenues attributed to domestic federal environmental remediation due to a reallocation of federal environmental funding to disaster relief funding  less work being awarded under existing contracts and or delays in funding under existing contracts and property management services  the substantial completion of a major fixed price contract in fiscal  and project services provided to us government customers in iraq due to a competitive bid environment arising from changes in government contracting vehicles to more fixed price opportunities 
gross profit and gross profit percentage gross profit for fiscal was million or as compared to million or for fiscal the change in gross profit and related gross profit percentage is due primarily to increased gross profit of million associated with providing hurricane recovery and restoration work which was performed at a lower gross profit percentage than our historical services  increased gross profit from two recently consolidated joint ventures providing services to the us department of energy  and increased gross profit and related percentage on non hurricane related work resulting from indirect cost absorption arising from our overall increase in sales volumes 
the increases in gross profit and related gross profit percentage are partially offset by the positive impact in fiscal of an adjustment to the estimated costs to complete a major fixed price contract  which resulted from cessation of certain operations on the project  the application of revised estimated governmental indirect rates to contract direct costs for fiscal offset by the fiscal positive impact of gross profit from the submission of fiscal year indirect rates  negotiation of restructuring cost proposals and other indirect rates to contract direct costs  lower gross profit and gross profit percentage from domestic federal environmental remediation work being awarded and executed this fiscal year as compared to last fiscal year  together with lower gross profit percentage earned on our consolidated joint ventures for the us department of energy and a higher volume of mission support services work compared to the lower volume of federal remediation work earning a higher gross profit percentage  and decreased project services supporting the us government customers in iraq 

table of contents backlog backlog for the e i segment as of august  is billion  compared to billion as of august  the increase in backlog is attributable to significant contract awards from fema  the us army corps of engineers  the air force center for environmental excellence afcee  the department of energy doe and state and local jurisdictions  augmented by recurring project awards from long term commercial clients 
these awards have offset backlog reductions in the middle east where opportunities for the near term have been less than anticipated as funding shifted to domestic project opportunities under global government contracts 
contract work executed throughout fiscal was in line with expectations adjusted for disaster relief  emergency response  and recovery services provided by e i 
we expect backlog to remain sensitive to the levels of funding on awards related to disaster relief  emergency response  and recovery services projects during fiscal  but could also be impacted by awards under global contracts during fiscal we believe e i is well positioned to capitalize on opportunities in core and emerging markets with both historic and developing services and the e i backlog will rest on our ability to win new contract awards in this highly competitive environment 
as of august   contracts with government agencies or entities owned by the us government and state government agencies are a predominant component of the e i backlog  accounting for billion or of the billion in backlog 
in fiscal we expect e i revenues will stabilize at less than fiscal levels as such current awarded disaster recovery work nears completion  however we expect that fiscal revenue levels will be well in excess of levels earned in with increases in federal and mission support services  supported by several doe projects and from commercial  state and local project work  bolstered by awards from clients in both the public and private sectors 
we expect gross profit for fiscal to be less than that earned in as we do not anticipate the significant disaster recovery work that was earned in the current fiscal year 
gross profit percentage is expected to be lower in fiscal than in fiscal  reflecting the impact of lower revenues to absorb indirect costs  lower than historical gross profit anticipated on the continuing disaster relief  emergency response and recovery related awards  the changing composition of work  including expanded services provided by our consolidated joint ventures and the competitive nature of work won in this industry sector 
e c segment revenues segment revenues for fiscal were  million as compared to  million in the million increase or is primarily attributable to increased activity on flue gas desulphurization fgd projects  increased activity relating to major coal power projects  the commencement of a major international petrochemical project  including million of customer furnished materials  the progress on a refinery project  and increase in proprietary technology sales and related services 

table of contents the increase in revenues for fiscal was partially offset by the wolf hollow litigation ruling resulting in million reduction of revenue for  decreased activities due to substantial completion of two power projects and a chemical project gross profit and gross profit percentage gross profit for the fiscal was million or of revenues compared to million or of revenues for fiscal this decrease is primarily attributable to the wolf hollow litigation ruling reducing gross profit by million during  loss provisions on certain refinery projects  gross profit reduction on a power project  and completion of a chemical project the decrease in gross profit and gross profit percentage for fiscal as compared to fiscal was partially offset by increased gross profits related to the commencement of a major international petrochemical plant projects  higher gross profit due to increased activities on power projects  and increased volume of proprietary technology sales and related engineering and a change in fiscal of our estimates for liability provisions related to contractual performance guarantees on sales of technology license agreements see performance guarantees in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
our e c segment has recorded revenues to date of million related to our significant unapproved change orders and claims as of august  on a percentage of completion basis 
substantially all of this revenue was recorded during fiscal the amounts included in our estimated total revenues at completion for these applicable projects are estimated to be a combined million 
these unapproved change orders and claims relate to delays and costs attributable to others as well as force majeure provisions under the contracts 
if we collect amounts different from the amounts we have estimated  those differences  which could be material  will be recognized as income or loss when realized 
for further description of our accounting policy with regard to unapproved change orders and claims see critical accounting policies and related estimates that have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this form k 
backlog backlog for the e c segment as of august  is billion  as compared to billion as of august  included in backlog at august   is million of customer furnished material which does not have any associated gross profit 
the increase in backlog is primarily a result of new major coal power and fgd projects 
this was partially offset by scheduled progress on major projects and the conversion of a fixed price contract to a reimbursable services contract 
we anticipate fiscal revenue and gross profit to increase due to increased activity on our epc fgd projects  major coal power projects and a major international petrochemical project 
at august   nine customers account for approximately billion or of backlog for the e c segment 
maintenance segment revenues the increase of million or during fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to revenues related to capital construction services for three customers in the chemical industry  increased activity and increased scope for one major nuclear project in the us  and increase in maintenance services for several new clients in the energy and chemical industries 

table of contents the increase in revenues for fiscal was partially offset by a reduction in the amounts of maintenance services for three customers in the energy industry due to these customers seasonal schedules of refueling outages and the successful completion of a decommissioning project in the energy industry 
gross profit and gross profit percentage gross profit for fiscal was million or compared to million or for fiscal the increase in gross profit is due to the increase in capital construction services for chemical industry customers  which is being executed at a higher gross profit than the routine maintenance services 
the increase in gross profit percentage related to capital construction services has been partially offset by a reduction of our estimate of total performance incentive fees on an energy project in the us  which resulted in a reduction of revenues and gross profit and the lower gross profit percentage 
our maintenance segment has recorded revenues to date of million related to our significant estimated  project incentives and unapproved change orders and claims as of august  on a percentage of completion basis 
backlog backlog increased million since august  the increase in backlog was due to two new awards in the chemical industry for capital construction services and two new awards in the energy industry to provide maintenance  modifications  and construction services partially offset by progress on our other domestic energy and chemical projects 
at august   five customers account for billion or of the billion in backlog for maintenance 
we anticipate fiscal revenues to be consistent with fiscal levels as we continue to provide additional services for current and new customers in the energy and chemical industries 
we also expect our gross profit to continue at current levels in fiscal  with a higher volume of capital construction services expected to be performed in fiscal offsetting our anticipated completion of a major nuclear project in f m segment revenues the increase in revenues of million or during fiscal as compared to fiscal is primarily attributable to significant new contract awards from the energy and chemical industries and the continued shortage of materials available in the manufacturing and distribution markets worldwide 
the increase in revenues is also due to a change in the method of eliminating intersegment revenues 
our f m segment performs pipe fabrication work on several e c projects 
we have previously classified these revenues as intersegment revenues and eliminated them from our f m segment  however  the gross profit from these sales remained within the f m segment 
beginning april  we are now segmenting the e c contracts and the revenue from the pipe fabrication portion of the contract will remain in the f m segment 
gross profit and gross profit percentage gross profit for fiscal was million or compared to million or for fiscal the increase in gross profit was primarily attributable to the increase in volume and better pricing of fabricated piping systems  increase in gross profit from bending machines sold and shipped  and better than anticipated gross profit from the domestic manufacturing and distribution business due the continued strong worldwide demand 
the increase in gross profit percentage was offset by the presentation of intersegment project activity mentioned above 
backlog backlog for the f m segment as of august  was million  as compared to million as of august  the increase in backlog includes approximately million in new contracts and increases in 
table of contents scope during the twelve months ended august  based on our market outlook  we expect revenues to increase and gross profit to remain near current levels for fiscal given the increased demand resulting from expected new contract awards and the continued shortage of materials available in the manufacturing and distribution markets worldwide 
general and administrative expenses  interest expense  and other income expense general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  during fiscal compared to fiscal in order to support the increasing revenue base and level of business activity 
despite the increase in g a expenses  g a expenses as a percentage of revenues was for fiscal compared to for fiscal specific items that contributed to the increase in g a expenses during fiscal included increased labor costs due to higher headcount primarily in accounting and finance  corporate functional and business development personnel  increased in professional fees for audit and legal services related to the sec informal inquiry and other business agreements  and hurricane related costs 
also contributing to higher g a in were our expensing of previously deferred third party financing costs and certain due diligence costs related to the proposed acquisition of a controlling interest in westinghouse and an increase in employee compensation expense for the cost of stock options now accounted for under sfas r 
we expect our general and administrative expenses to be higher in fiscal than fiscal as a result of anticipated additional costs required to support significant growth in many of our markets 
general and administrative expenses for fiscal also includes million of expenses related to costs associated with a potential acquisition 
we defer certain third party costs directly attributable to our efforts on potential acquisitions 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we determined that it was unlikely that we would obtain a controlling interest in the potential acquisition and  therefore  expensed all costs including the amounts previously deferred  related to the incremental effort required to obtain the contemplated controlling interest primarily financing certain due diligence costs 
a portion of the costs related to due diligence was deferred as of august   and will be reflected in our accounting for the acquisition of our investment in westinghouse  which closed in october the decrease in interest expense reflects the decrease in our long term debt  which resulted from the repurchase of our senior notes during the third quarter of fiscal  which was partially offset by interest due to borrowings on our credit facility 
fiscal included a loss of million on the retirement of debt 
the decrease in other income expense for fiscal was primarily due to the recognition of a million gain on the sale of the assets of shaw power technologies  inc during fiscal unconsolidated entities  income taxes and discontinued operations during fiscal  we recognized earnings of million as compared to earnings of million for fiscal from operations of unconsolidated entities  including joint ventures  which are accounted for using the equity method 
the decreased earnings from unconsolidated entities  net reflects the consolidation of a previously unconsolidated entity due to our acquisition of one of our joint venture partners  a decrease in earnings from privatization entities as a whole  and start up of our joint venture with kb home 
our effective tax rate was and for fiscal and  respectively 
during fiscal  we recorded a million income tax expense to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets related to our uk pension liability 
excluding the million valuation allowance discussed above  our effective tax rate for was 
the decrease in the effective rate for fiscal is primarily due to utilization of foreign net operating losses nol previously reserved 

table of contents the losses from discontinued operations of million  net of taxes for fiscal  as compared to a loss of million  net of taxes for fiscal  reflect discontinued operations and impairment charges associated with the decision to discontinue our robotics paint stripping business and to make the productive assets available for sale compared to discontinued operations  contract termination costs  and other costs associated with the sale of roche limited  consulting group roche and the sale of our hanger engineering and pipe support businesses during fiscal we also had a gain of million  net of tax  on the sale of roche in fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal restated the explanatory statement on page of this report and notes and to our consolidated financial statements in item of the report address the restatement of our financial statements for fiscal years and executive summary increased activity in the energy and chemical markets  consistent demand for clean air and fuels and transmission and distribution services  garrison support services  and disaster relief and construction services in the southeast region of the us in the first quarter of fiscal contributed to our overall revenue growth for fiscal gross profit for fiscal significantly increased compared to fiscal  which included a charge of million related to neg power projects 
excluding the neg charge  gross profit for fiscal increased by million as the result of increased construction activity in our energy and chemical projects  increased maintenance services for our energy and chemical customers  and increased profits on our manufacturing and distribution products 
however  our e i segment experienced a decrease in gross profit in fiscal due to a decline in the volume of its commercial services and of its federal project and environmental remediation services 
for fiscal  general and administrative expense were of revenues as compared to for fiscal  however there was a charge of million in fiscal related to the accelerated depreciation of certain software assets which  when factored in  resulted in  general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues for fiscal were relatively consistent with fiscal in addition  other income and expenses for fiscal included a loss on the retirement of debt of million and a decrease in interest expense of approximately million for fiscal resulting from the repurchase of our senior notes during the third quarter of fiscal see note of our consolidated financial statements 
our effective tax rate for fiscal also reflects a million increase in our deferred tax asset valuation allowance see note of our consolidated financial statements 
during fiscal and  we sold two of our non core businesses 
roche ltd  consulting group  which was part of our e i segment  was sold on june  our hanger engineering and pipe support businesses  which were included in our f m segment  were sold on august  both are presented in discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements 
between august  and august   our backlog has increased approximately million or 
a significant portion of the increase is due to the growth of our fossil fuel epc projects for multiple customers and chemical projects such as an ethylene plant and clean fuel projects in our e c segment 
new contracts for natural gas separation and a compression plant in our f m segment accounted for a percentage of the increase  however  there were offsetting decreases due to steady execution of existing contracts without increases in scopes of current work  a minimal amount of new contract awards in our e i segment and progress on existing contracts in our maintenance segment 
segment analysis e i segment revenues the decrease of million or for fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to a decrease in commercial services due to a significant project completed in  which was not replaced in and a significant project provided significantly more volume in as compared to  fewer federal government based opportunities leading to a more competitive market for these opportunities  and our national commercial customers trending toward requesting bids on opportunities as opposed to issuing new awards under master service agreements  a decrease in federal environmental remediation and property management services due to federal budget restrictions impacting environmental opportunities  less work being awarded under existing contracts and or delays in funding under existing contracts  and a decrease in our project services supporting the us government customers in iraq due to delays in government funding combined with a competitive bid environment arising from changes in contracting vehicles to more fixed price opportunities 

table of contents these decreases in revenues were partially offset by increased garrison support and logistic support services for the u 
s 
army and revenues earned providing disaster relief and construction services to federal customers in hurricane damaged areas 
gross profit and gross profit percentage gross profit for fiscal was million or as compared to million or for fiscal the decrease in gross profit and gross profit percentage is due primarily to a decrease in commercial services  resulting from lower volume of work and recognition of contract losses on certain commercial construction projects of approximately million in fiscal  arising from project execution issues in the current fiscal year  a decrease in project services supporting the us government customers in iraq  and a decrease in federal environmental remediation services due to less work being awarded under existing contracts and delays in funding  which were offset by increased gross profit and gross profit percentage due to negotiation of restructuring costs proposed  finalization of sale lease back costs and their associated treatment  and other indirect rate negotiations  resulting in the application of revised government indirect rates to contract direct costs discussed further below  offset by increased gross profit and gross profit percentage due to a reduction in estimated costs to complete a major fixed price contract as a result of cessation of certain operations at the request of the customer which decreased our estimated project expenses as compared to the prior year for this project discussed further below  and offset by increased gross profit and gross profit percentage due to providing disaster relief and construction services to federal customers in hurricane damaged areas 
the revised government indirect rates discussed above increased fiscal gross profit by million 
this compares to a million increase in gross profit in fiscal resulting from other matters impacting indirect rates 
of the amounts recognized in fiscal and fiscal  million and million  respectively  were reductions of accruals recorded in the acquisition of the it group in fiscal our e i segment recorded gross profit on a single major environmental remediation fixed price contract of million in fiscal and million in fiscal the gross profit percentage recorded on this major project was significantly higher than the gross profit percentage reflected on other major e i contracts in these periods 
this project was completed in fiscal gross profit and gross profit percentage for fiscal and fiscal reflect a decrease in cost of revenues of million and million  respectively  for amortization of contract adjustments related to contracts acquired in the it group acquisition  and a million decrease in cost of revenues for fiscal for the reduction of accrued contract losses related to contracts acquired in the it group acquisition 

table of contents backlog backlog for the e i segment was billion as of august  compared to billion as of august  the decrease in the e i segment backlog since august  is primarily due to steady execution of existing contracts without commensurate increases in scope of work or new contract awards 
subsequent to august   in the aftermath of hurricane katrina  e i received awards under contracts with fema and the us army  and expanded capacity on the army corps of engineers disaster relief blue roof contract  to provide a full range of services supporting hurricane clean up and recovery efforts 
there is no significant revenue in our backlog estimates for the contracting activity that occurred as a result of hurricane katrina as of august  e c segment revenues the increase of million or in segment revenues for fiscal compared to fiscal is due to several factors including increased activity on major energy projects  clean fuels projects and projects related to clean air act regulations  the inclusion of a full year of results of shaw eds operations  which was acquired in january  the fiscal charge on the covert and harquahala projects  which lowered revenues and gross profit  which was partially offset by the scheduled completion of the ethylene plant in china and the sale of pti in december gross profit and gross profit percentages the increase in gross profit and gross profit percentage for fiscal compared to fiscal is due to increased project activity and profitability on major energy projects 
the first quarter of the fiscal period reflects the loss recorded on the covert and harquahala epc energy projects 
increases in gross profit were partially offset by the scheduled completion of the ethylene plant in china in spring  the sale of pti in december and an impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal related to the pike equipment that had been received in settlement of claims during fiscal our gross profit for was positively impacted by million reduction of accruals recorded in the acquisition of stone webster due to favorable progress on a dispute with our customer on a major epc project that was substantially completed prior to fiscal the positive impact of this event was offset by negative adjustments in of approximately million to amounts expected to be recovered on our claims on major projects 
gross profit and gross profit percentage for fiscal and fiscal reflect an increase decrease in cost of revenues of million and million  respectively  for amortization of contract adjustments related to contracts acquired in the fiscal stone webster acquisition  and million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively for the recognition of accrued losses related to contracts acquired in the stone webster acquisition 
backlog e c segment s backlog has increased million from august  due to growth in both our fossil fuel epc and our chemical backlog 
the fossil fuel backlog increased substantially due to awards relating to flue gas desulphurization fgd for multiple customers  and a megawatt coal unit designed to use circulating fluidized bed technology 
chemical backlog increased primarily as a result of a letter of intent for an ethylene plant in saudi arabia  and clean fuel projects in north america 
this was offset by the result of scheduled progress on major gas fired energy epc projects in new york and utah and completion of two chemical projects including the ethylene plant in china 

table of contents maintenance segment revenues the increase of million or during fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to increase in activity and additional scope associated with a major domestic energy projects  increase in maintenance services for several clients in the energy and chemical industries  and the award of a new nuclear decommissioning project  offset by decreasing activity at our uk subsidiary 
gross profit and gross profit percentage gross profit for fiscal was million or compared to million or for fiscal the increase in gross profit was due primarily to increase in maintenance services discussed above  and a decrease in losses in our uk operations resulting from efforts to make those operations smaller  more productive and efficient 
the increase in gross profit during fiscal was partially offset by our agreement to perform additional tasks related to a major domestic energy project that were previously not included in our scope of work 
these additional tasks increased the contract value for the project by approximately and added gross profit to our original project estimate 
due to the increase in the scope of the work on the project  our calculated percentage of completion at november  decreased as compared to the percentage of completion calculated as of august   which resulted in the temporary reversal of performance incentive revenues and gross profit in the first quarter of our fiscal that were previously recognized 
on a major domestic energy project  we record material performance incentives based primarily on schedule and cost savings on the project that will be ultimately determined and paid at the completion of the project which we anticipate will occur in fiscal we record the estimated amount of performance incentives that we expect to be paid in revenue and unbilled receivables on the percentage of completion method of accounting based on costs incurred to date as a percentage of estimated total project costs at completion of the project 
due to the increase in the scope of work on the project  the incentive revenues are being recognized over larger estimated total project costs at completion  which is lowering the gross profit percentage on the project as compared with the prior year 
however  the performance incentive revenues and gross profit amount reversed will be recognized as costs are incurred over the remaining contract term 
additionally  in conjunction with the increase in our scope of work  we reduced our estimate of the total performance incentives expected to be earned on the project resulting in a reversal of revenues and gross profit previously recognized 
although these reversals were offset by progress in percentage of completion achieved during the period  we recognized a net reduction in revenues and gross profit on the project of million related to the performance incentive in the first quarter of fiscal backlog backlog decreased million since august  the decrease in backlog is due to progress on existing contracts primarily offset by the additional scope of work on the tva nuclear restart project as discussed above and other project awards in the nuclear energy and chemical industries 

table of contents f m segment revenues the increase of million or during fiscal compared to fiscal was due to increase in fabrication revenues for the chemical industry  including chemical  petrochemical  and refinery  increase in demand for our manufactured products as a result of world wide shortages of such products  and increase in price of steel  which we are able to pass along to our customers 
segment revenues exclude intersegment revenues of million for fiscal compared to million in fiscal gross profit and gross profit percentage gross profit for fiscal was million or compared to million or for fiscal the increase in gross profit and gross profit percentage was due to increased gross profit being realized on the segment s manufacturing and distribution products in late fiscal and during fiscal  and intersegment revenues as they are eliminated from the f m segment consolidation while the related gross profit recognized remains with the f m segment 
the increase in gross profit percentage for fiscal includes related to these intersegment gross profit 
backlog backlog increased from million as of august  to million as of august  the increase in backlog reflects approximately million in new contracts for an oil and gas customer for natural gas separation and a compression plant in qatar 
the increase in backlog was partially offset by work performed under existing contracts during the twelve months ended august  general and administrative expenses  interest income  interest expense and other income expense general and administrative expenses were approximately million in fiscal compared with approximately million in fiscal our general and administrative expenses for fiscal included amortization expense of million related to the acceleration of amortization of certain software assets in the first quarter of fiscal as a result of a successful implementation of software systems 
the million increase during fiscal  excluding the million of amortization in fiscal  is due to an increase in the accrual of employee bonuses  an increase in costs supporting our sarbanes oxley compliance initiatives and an increase in the legal and consulting fees associated with the informal inquiry by the sec  class action litigation and contract disputes and stock based compensation expense 
for fiscal  general and administrative expenses were of revenues as compared to for fiscal without the additional amortization in fiscal of million  general and administrative expenses were of revenues in fiscal interest expense was approximately million for fiscal  compared to approximately million for fiscal the decrease from the prior year reflects the decrease in our debt since fiscal  which resulted from the repurchase of our senior notes during the third quarter of fiscal see note of our consolidated financial statements 
interest income for fiscal increased to approximately million as compared to million for fiscal  primarily as a result of interest earned on a larger restricted and escrowed cash account compared to fiscal other income and expense for fiscal included a loss of million on the retirement of debt compared to million in fiscal 
table of contents unconsolidated entities  discontinued operations  change in exchange rates  other comprehensive income and income taxes during fiscal  we recognized earnings of million as compared to earnings of million for fiscal from operations of unconsolidated entities  including joint ventures  which are accounted for using the equity method 
the increased earnings in fiscal reflect the increased activity in several of our unconsolidated entities related to military family housing privatization  maintenance services and environmental services 
other comprehensive income loss changed from fiscal to fiscal as the result of a significant change in the minimum pension liability and the gain on our foreign currency transactions 
the increase in minimum pension liability was primarily due to an adjustment in the mortality rate of the participants of our pension plans and a decrease in discount rate assumptions during fiscal  while the change in our foreign currency transactions was caused by a fluctuating valuation of the us dollar as primarily compared to the euro and great britain s pound 
the losses from discontinued operations of million  net of taxes for fiscal  as compared to a loss of million  net of taxes for fiscal  reflect discontinued operations  contract termination costs  and other costs associated with the sale of roche limited  consulting group roche and the sale of our hanger engineering and pipe support businesses during fiscal and fiscal we also had a gain of million  net of tax  on the sale of roche in fiscal and a million impairment charge  net of tax  during fiscal in connection with the classification of our hanger engineering and pipe support businesses as assets held for sale 
our effective tax rate was and for fiscal and  respectively 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded a million income tax expense to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets related to our uk pension liability 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance  if based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
this expense has no impact on cash tax paid or our ability to deduct the related expenses to reduce future cash tax payable in the uk currently  uk tax laws do not provide an expiration date for net operating loss carryforwards  therefore these deductions can be carried forward indefinitely and used to offset future taxable income that we generate in the uk although the deferred tax assets related to these pension liabilities were recorded to shareholder s equity through other comprehensive income the accounting rules require that valuation allowances against those deferred tax assets be recognized as a charge through income tax expense 
excluding the million valuation allowance discussed above  our effective tax rate for was 
the increase over is due to the mix of foreign including foreign export revenues versus domestic work  and our assessment of our potential inability to utilize certain net operating losses in the foreseeable future that are being generated by some of our foreign subsidiaries 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow for fiscal  and executive summary our liquidity position is impacted by cash generated from operations  customer advances and underbillings of costs incurred a condition that often accompanies projects with claims and unapproved change orders or loss projects on contracts in progress and access to capital financial markets 
as customer advances are reduced through project execution  if not replaced by advances on new projects  our cash position will be reduced 
cash is used to fund operations  capital expenditures  acquisitions and service debt 
cash flows from operations were negative during fiscal as compared to fiscal as the hurricane disaster recovery work has increased the amounts due from us government clients and agencies owned by the us government  primarily fema and the us army corps of engineers 
while we have a significant history of recovering amounts 
table of contents related to work performed for the us government  the current circumstances increase the uncertainties in estimating the amounts we will actually recover under existing contracts for work we have already performed 
if our estimated amounts recoverable on these projects differ from the amounts ultimately collected  those differences will be recognized as income or loss and our earnings and cash flows could be materially impacted 
as of august   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  restricted and escrowed cash of million  and million of availability under our million credit facility amended subsequent to august   see discussion of westinghouse acquisition below to fund operations 
we also have a shelf registration statement with million available for the issuance of any combination of equity or debt securities if needed 
management believes cash generated from operations  available borrowings under our credit facility  and if necessary  available sales of equity or debt under our shelf registration will be sufficient to fund operations for the next twelve months 
the following table sets forth the cash flows in thousands year ended august  restated restated cash flow provided by used in operations cash flow provided by used in investing cash flow provided by used in financing cash from consolidation of variable interest entities effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash operating cash flow net operating cash flows decreased by million during the year ended august  compared to the same period in fiscal the decrease is due primarily to providing hurricane disaster recovery work 
subsequent to august   we received payments from our customers related to hurricane disaster recovery work totaling in executing our disaster recovery work associated with hurricanes katrina and rita  we experienced payment terms with subcontractors generally shorter than historical levels reflecting a tight market for delivery of services and supplies into the disaster affected area 
in contrast  we have experienced significantly slower historical receipts for our services as final contract terms are resolved with customers and our state and local government customers await federal relief funds 
the extended periods to collect payment for our services combined with a significant increase in the volume of work on these disaster relief efforts have resulted in a use of cash and reduction in operating cash flows during the fiscal year 
the decrease in net operating cash flows in fiscal was also impacted by the disbursement of funds associated with one project in the us  which achieved substantial completion during the third quarter of fiscal year additionally  we recorded claims and unapproved charge orders on certain projects that were being executed in in our e c segment which will not result in cash inflows until those projects are completed and the final contractual terms are mutually agreed 
partially offsetting these decreases were cash receipts related to claims recovery of approximately million 
we expect that the terms negotiated on new major epc projects will include arrangements for significant retainage of amounts billed by us or significant other financial security in forms including performance bonds and letters of credit or a combination of retainage and other security 
our expectations may vary materially from what is actually received as the timing of these new projects is uncertain and a single or group of large projects could have a significant impact on sources and uses of cash 
net operating cash flows increased by million from fiscal to fiscal the increase in fiscal was primarily due to net income  losses on retirement of debt and significant cash that was provided by settlements on various claims and the receipt of proceeds from a domestic energy project partially offset by a decrease in advanced billings and billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts 
investing cash flow cash provided by investing activities increased million from fiscal to fiscal significant cash was deposited into restricted and escrowed cash accounts  primarily to set aside funding for one project in the us during the first half of fiscal as compared to significant cash received from the withdrawal of funds from restricted and escrowed cash accounts associated with completion of that project during fiscal 
table of contents cash utilized by investing activities increased million from fiscal to fiscal significant cash was used in fiscal  primarily to fund the restricted and escrowed cash account associated with our epc project to build a combined cycle energy plant in astoria  new york  which was partially offset by the sale of certain assets 
net activity of our marketable securities of million and cash received from restricted and escrowed cash of million helped to provide net cash inflows during fiscal financing cash flow net financing cash flows increased million from fiscal fiscal higher amounts of cash were provided by net proceeds from our revolving credit agreements during the first half of fiscal as compared to the first half of fiscal net financing cash flows increased million from fiscal to fiscal significant amounts of cash were provided by our stock offerings that occurred during fiscal and fiscal  which were used to redeem a majority of our senior notes and lyons during fiscal and  respectively 
we also had proceeds of million from our credit facilities during fiscal credit facilities and revolving lines of credit subsequent to august   we entered into amendment iv to our credit agreement  which increased our credit facility from million to million and increased our sublimits for revolving lines of credit and financial letters of credit from million to million until november  and million thereafter

westinghouse acquisition we announced on october  that we joined with toshiba corporation toshiba in the acquisition of westinghouse electric company westinghouse 
our interest in westinghouse was acquired by our owned special purpose acquisition subsidiary  nuclear energy holdings  llc neh 
on october   neh closed the private placement of japanese yen denominated bonds the bonds with an approximate principal amount of billion

off balance sheet arrangements on a limited basis  performance assurances are extended to customers that guarantee certain performance measurements upon completion of a project 
if performance assurances are extended to customers  generally our maximum potential exposure is the remaining cost of the work to be performed by or on behalf of third parties under engineering and construction contracts with potential recovery from third party vendors and subcontractors for work performed in the ordinary course of contract execution 
as a result  the total costs of the project could exceed our original cost estimates and we could experience reduced gross profit or possibly a loss for that project 
in some cases  where we fail to meet certain performance standards  we may be subject to contractual liquidated damages 

table of contents during fiscal  we entered into a guaranty agreement with a third party to guarantee the performance of one of our unconsolidated entities  american eagle northwest  llc  related to the development and construction phase of the pacific northwest communities  llc military family housing privatization which is scheduled to be completed in calendar year our maximum exposure under this performance guarantee at the time we entered into this guarantee was estimated to be million 
as of august   the maximum exposure amount has decreased to million due to development and construction services already executed  and our exposure will continue to be reduced over the contract term as further project services are provided

critical accounting policies and related estimates that have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made  and changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  or use different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period  would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and audit committee has reviewed the foregoing disclosure 
in addition  there are other items within our financial statements that required estimation  but are not deemed critical as defined above 
changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements 
information regarding our other accounting policies is included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
engineering  procurement and construction contract and environmental and infrastructure revenue recognition and profit and loss estimates including claims nature of estimates required a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from engineering  procurement and construction contracts 
the contracts may be performed as stand alone engineering  procurement or construction contracts or as combined contracts ie one contract that covers engineering  procurement and construction or a combination thereof 
for contracts that meet the criteria under sop  we recognize revenues on the percentage of completion method  primarily based on costs incurred to date compared with total estimated contract costs 
it is possible there will be future and currently unforeseeable significant adjustments to our estimated contract revenues  costs and gross profit for contracts currently in process  particularly in the later stages of the contracts 
these adjustments are common in the construction industry and inherent in the nature of our contracts 
these adjustments could  depending on the magnitude of the adjustments and or the number of contracts being executed  materially  positively or negatively  affect our operating results in an annual or quarterly reporting period 
these adjustments are  in our opinion  most likely to occur as a result of  or be affected by  the following factors in the application of the percentage of completion accounting method discussed above for our contracts 
revenues and gross profit from cost reimbursable  long term contracts can be significantly affected by contract incentives penalties that may not be known or finalized until the later stages of the contracts 
substantially all of our revenues from cost reimbursable contracts are based on costs incurred plus mark up and or fees where applicable 
applying our revenue recognition practices to these types of contracts usually results in revenues being recognized as work is performed and costs are incurred and generally results in a reasonably consistent gross profit during most of the contract term 

table of contents our cost reimbursable contracts are sometimes structured as target price contracts 
target price contracts contain an incentive penalty arrangement which results in our fee being adjusted  within certain limits  for cost under runs overruns to an established target price  representing our estimated cost and fee for the project 
in addition  certain target price contracts require that we share in cost overruns in excess of our fee which could result in a loss on the contract should such a level of cost overruns occur 
cost reimbursable contracts generally provide for reimbursement of our direct costs  but generally limit our fee to an agreed upon percentage of costs or to a certain specified amount and often specify costs that are not reimbursable 
usually  target price contracts are priced with higher fees than cost reimbursable contracts because of the uncertainties relating to an adjustable fee arrangement or for the sharing of potential cost overruns in excess of the fee 
additionally  both the target cost and cost reimbursable contracts frequently have other incentive and penalty provisions for such matters as schedule and performance results 
generally  the penalty provisions for our cost reimbursable contracts are capped to limit our monetary exposure 
although we believe it is unlikely that we could incur losses or lose all of our gross profit on our cost reimbursable contracts  it is possible for penalties to reduce or eliminate previously recorded profits 
the incentive penalty provisions are usually finalized as contract change orders either subsequent to negotiation with  or verification by  our customers 
therefore  while cost reimbursable contracts generally limit our risks on the related projects  we can and do incur losses on these contracts 
in most situations  the amount and impact of incentives penalties are not  or cannot be  finalized until the completion stages of the contract  at which time we record adjustments to the amounts of project revenues and cost on a cumulative catch up basis 
we have fixed price contracts  for which the accuracy of gross profit is dependent on the accuracy of cost estimates and other factors 
the accuracy of the gross profit we report for fixed price contracts is dependent upon the judgments we make in estimating our contract performance  contract revenues and cost  and our ability to recover additional contract costs through change orders  claims or backcharges to the customer  subcontractors and vendors 
many of these contracts also have incentive penalty provisions 
increases in cost estimates and decreases in revenue estimates  unless recoverable from claims or change orders  will result in a reduction in profit 
disputes with other parties involved in the contract can and often do occur 
these disputes are generally the result of one party incurring costs or damages caused by another party during execution of a project 
we may incur additional costs or be damaged and we may cause additional costs or damage other parties 
the other parties include our customer on the contract  subcontractors and vendors we have contracted with to execute portions of the project and others 
we may claim damages against others and others may claim damages against us 
collectively  we refer to disputes related to collection of these damages as claims 
claims include amounts in excess of the agreed contract price or amounts not included in the original contract price that we seek to collect from our customers for delays  errors in specifications and designs  contract terminations  change orders in dispute or unapproved as to both scope and price  or other causes of unanticipated additional costs 
these claims against customers are included in our revenue estimates as additional contract revenues up to the amount of contract costs incurred when the recovery of such amounts is probable 
backcharges and claims against and from our vendors  subcontractors and others are included in our cost estimates as a reduction or increase in total estimated costs when recovery or payment of the amounts is probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated 
revenues and gross profit on contracts can be significantly affected by change orders and claims that may not be ultimately negotiated until the later stages of a contract or after a contract is completed 
when estimating the amount of total gross profit or loss on a contract  we include claims related to our customers as adjustments to revenues and claims related to vendors  subcontractors and others as adjustments to cost of revenues when the recovery of such amounts is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated 
recording claims ultimately increases the gross profit or reduces the loss that would otherwise be recorded without consideration of the claims 
our claims against others are recorded up to the amount of costs incurred and include no gross profit until such time as they are finalized and approved 
in most cases  the claims included in determining contract gross profit are less than the actual claim that will be or has been presented 

table of contents claims are included in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on the balance sheet see note of our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our significant claims 
assumptions and approach used we use accounting principles set forth in american institute of certified public accountants  or aicpa  statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  and other applicable accounting standards to account for our contracts 
performance incentives are included in our estimates of revenues using the percentage of completion method when their realization is reasonably assured 
cancellation fees are recognized when received 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which the losses are identified 
the cumulative effect of changes to estimated contract gross profit and loss  including those arising from contract penalty provisions such as liquidated damages  final contract settlements  warranty claims and reviews of our costs performed by customers  are recognized in the period in which the revisions are identified 
to the extent that these adjustments result in a reduction or elimination of previously reported profits  we report such a change by recognizing a charge against current earnings  which might be significant depending on the size of the project or the adjustment 
gross profit is recorded for change orders and claims in the period such amounts are settled or approved 
other revenue recognition and profit and loss estimates nature of estimates required revenues generated from licensing our chemical industry performance enhancement technologies are recorded in the period earned based on the performance criteria defined in the related contracts 
assumptions and approach used for running royalty agreements  we recognize revenues based on customer production volumes at the contract specified unit rates 
sales of paid up license agreements are coupled with the sale of engineering services for the integration of the technology into the customers processes 
for paid up license agreements  revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion method  measured by the percentage of costs incurred to date on engineering services to total estimated contract costs primarily engineering cost and estimated performance guarantee liability 
under such agreements  revenue available for recognition on a percentage of completion basis is limited to the agreement value less a provision for contractually specified performance guarantees 
the provision for performance guarantees is recorded in gross profit when  and if  the related performance testing is successfully completed 
nature of estimates required for most housing privatization projects we provide operations management  development  and construction services through owned entities the privatization subsidiaries 
these services are provided to the companies that hold the equity ownership in the housing and related assets the privatization entities 
typically  the privatization subsidiary and the related military branch each own a portion of the privatization entity during the term of contract  which generally is years 
the privatization subsidiary recognizes revenues from operations management and related incentive fees as earned 
the privatization subsidiary recognizes revenues on development and construction service fees on the percentage of completion method based on costs incurred to date compared with total estimated contract costs 
assumptions and approach used we defer our economic ownership percentage of development and construction service fees and recognize those fees over the useful lives of the related capitalized improvements 
we recognize earnings for our economic ownership percentage of the net earnings of the privatization entity 
because the privatization subsidiaries are unconsolidated subsidiaries  we record their results in earnings from unconsolidated entities see note of our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents litigation  commitments and contingencies nature of estimates required we are subject to various claims  lawsuits  environmental matters and administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business 
estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires judgment and assessment based on professional knowledge and experience of our management and legal counsel 
the ultimate resolution of any such exposure may vary from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances become known 
assumptions and approach used in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  amounts are recorded as charges to earnings when we determine that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
income taxes nature of estimates required  assumptions and approach used deferred income taxes are provided on a liability method whereby deferred tax assets liabilities are established for the difference between the financial reporting basis and the income tax basis of assets and liabilities  as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and other tax credits 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in our opinion  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the period in which those temporary differences become deductible 
we also consider the reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment of such realization 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment 
as of august   we had gross deferred tax assets of million  net of valuation allowance  including million related to net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
as of august   we had a deferred tax asset valuation allowance of million see note of our consolidated financial statements 
acquisitions fair value accounting and goodwill impairment nature of estimates required goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquired businesses over the fair value of their identifiable net assets 
our goodwill balance as of august  was approximately million  most of which related to the stone webster acquisition in fiscal and the it group acquisition in fiscal see note to our consolidated financial statements 
our estimates of the fair values of the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities we acquire in acquisitions are determined by reference to various internal and external data and judgments  including the use of third party experts 
these estimates can and do differ from the basis or value generally representing the acquired entity s actual or amortized cost previously recorded by the acquired entity for its assets and liabilities 
accordingly  our post acquisition financial statements are materially impacted by and dependent on the accuracy of management s fair value estimates and adjustments 
our experience has been that the most significant of these estimates are the values assigned to construction contracts  production backlog  customer relationships  licenses and technology 
these estimates can also have a positive or negative material effect on future reported operating results 
further  our future operating results may also be positively or negatively materially impacted if the final values for the assets acquired or liabilities assumed in our acquisitions are materially different from the fair value estimates which we recorded for the acquisition 
assumptions and approach used we completed our annual impairment test during the third quarter of fiscal in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and determined that goodwill at march  was not impaired 
we test goodwill for impairment at each of our reporting unit levels 
in evaluating whether an impairment of goodwill exists  we calculate the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units based on estimated projected discounted cash 
table of contents flows as of the date we perform the impairment tests implied fair value 
we then compare the resulting estimated implied fair values  by reporting unit  to the respective book values  including goodwill 
if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value we measure the amount of the impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value which is a reasonable estimate of the value of goodwill for the purpose of measuring an impairment loss of the reporting unit s goodwill to the carrying amount of that goodwill 
to the extent that the carrying amount of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  we recognize an impairment loss on the goodwill at that time 
in evaluating whether there was an impairment of goodwill  we also take into consideration changes in our business and changes in our projected discounted cash flows  in addition to our stock price and market value of interest bearing obligations 
we do not believe any events have occurred since our annual impairment test that would cause an impairment of goodwill 
however  our businesses are cyclical and subject to competitive pressures 
therefore  it is possible that the goodwill values of our businesses could be adversely impacted in the future by these or other factors and that a significant impairment adjustment  which would reduce earnings and affect various debt covenants  could be required in such circumstances 
our next required annual impairment test will be conducted in the third quarter of fiscal unless indicators of impairment occur prior to that time 
retirement benefits nature of estimates required  assumptions and approach used assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for our pension plans are regularly evaluated by management in consultation with outside actuaries who are relied upon as experts 
in the event that we determine that changes are warranted in the assumptions used  such as the discount rate  expected long term rate of return on investments  or future salary costs  our future pension benefit expenses could increase or decrease 
as of august   we had a minimum pension liability recorded of million 
this liability will likely require us to increase our future cash contributions to the plans

table of contents in june the fasb ratified the consensuses of emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation eitf 
eitf indicates that the income statement presentation on either a gross basis or a net basis of the taxes within the scope of the issue is an accounting policy decision 
our accounting policy is to present the taxes within the scope of eitf on a net basis 
the adoption of eitf in the first fiscal quarter of did not result in a change to our accounting policy and  accordingly  did not have a material effect on our condensed consolidated financial statements

 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements  and changes the requirements for the accounting for  and reporting of  a change in accounting principles 
this statement applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principles and changes required by an accounting pronouncement in the unusual instance that the pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions 
under previous guidance  changes in accounting principle were recognized as a cumulative affect in the net income of the period of the change 
sfas requires retrospective application of changes in accounting principle  limited to the direct effects of the change  to prior periods financial statements  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
additionally  this statement requires that a change in depreciation  amortization or depletion method for long lived  nonfinancial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate affected by a change in accounting principle and that correction of errors in previously issued financial statements should be termed a restatement 
the provisions in sfas are effective for accounting changes and correction of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december   which is effective with our first quarter of our fiscal we intend to adopt the disclosure requirements upon the effective date of the pronouncement 
we do not believe that the adoption of this pronouncement will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
fsp sfas  accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of  provides enterprises more time beyond the financial reporting period during which the act took effect to evaluate the act s impact on the enterprise s plan for reinvestment or repatriation of certain foreign earnings for purposes of applying fasb statement 
the act provides for a special one time tax deduction of dividends received deduction on certain foreign earnings repatriated in fiscal or the 
table of contents deduction would result in an approximate federal tax on a portion of the foreign earnings repatriated 
state  local and foreign taxes could apply as well 
to qualify for this federal tax deduction  the earnings must be reinvested in the us pursuant to a domestic reinvestment plan 
certain other criteria in the jobs act must be satisfied as well 
we studied the provisions of the act related to the repatriation of earnings and did not repatriate any earnings as of august  effective september   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r utilizing the modified prospective approach 
as a result of adopting sfas r on september   our income before taxes  net income and basic and diluted income per share for the year ended august   were million  million  and lower  respectively  than if we had continued to account for share based compensation under apb opinion no 
for our stock option grants 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we accounted for stock option grants in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees the intrinsic value method  and accordingly  recognized no compensation expense for stock option grants 
under the modified prospective approach  sfas r applies to new awards and to awards that were outstanding on september  as well as those that are subsequently modified  repurchased or cancelled 
under the modified prospective approach  compensation cost recognized during fiscal includes compensation cost for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of september   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas prior periods were not restated to reflect the impact of adopting the new standard 
differences in assumptions in estimating fair value under sfas r versus sfas to options include adjustments to patterns of employees with respect to expected future exercise patterns and the implied volatility of our stock price 
upon adoption of sfas r  we also recorded an immaterial cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as a result of our change in policy from recognizing forfeitures as they occur to one where we recognize expense based on our expectation of the amount of awards that will vest over the requisite service period for our restricted stock awards 
at august  there was million of unrecognized compensation cost related to share based payments for stock option awards which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
as of august   we have unrecognized compensation expense of million associated with restricted stock awards 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates  primarily in the us our policy is to manage interest rates through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt and short term fixed rate investments 
we currently do not use any derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate risk 
the table below provides information about our future maturities of principal for outstanding debt instruments including capital leases and fair value at august  in millions expected maturity dates fair thereafter total value long term debt fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate short term line of credit variable rate average interest rate at august   the interest rate on our primary credit facility was with an availability of million see note of our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our credit facility 

table of contents the estimated fair value of long term debt and capital leases as of august  and was approximately million and million  respectively 
the fair value of the senior notes as of august  was based on current market prices of such debt and based on the assumption that the recorded balance approximates fair value 
foreign currency risks the majority of our transactions are in us dollars  however  certain of our subsidiaries conduct their operations in various foreign currencies 
currently  when considered appropriate  we use hedging instruments to manage our risks associated with our operating activities when an operation enters into a transaction in a currency that is different from its local currency 
in these circumstances  we will frequently utilize forward exchange contracts to hedge the anticipated purchases and or revenues 
we attempt to minimize our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations by matching our revenues and expenses in the same currency for our contracts 
as of august   we had minimal forward exchange contracts outstanding that were hedges of certain commitments of foreign subsidiaries 
the exposure from these commitments is not material to our results of operations or financial position see notes and of our consolidated financial statements
