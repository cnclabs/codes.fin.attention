table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued cvi net sales practitioner and patient preferences in the worldwide contact lens market continue to change 
the major shifts are from conventional lenses replaced annually to disposable and frequently replaced lenses 
disposable lenses are designed for either daily  two week or monthly replacement  frequently replaced lenses are designed for replacement after one to three months 
commodity lenses to specialty lenses including toric lenses  cosmetic lenses  multifocal lenses  continuous wear lenses and lenses to alleviate dry eye symptoms 
commodity spherical lenses to value added spherical lenses such as lenses with aspherical optical properties or higher oxygen permeable lenses such as silicone hydrogels 
some of these shifts favor cvi s line of specialty products  which now comprise of cvi s worldwide business 
definitions contact lens revenue includes sales of conventional  disposable and single use spherical lenses  some of which are aspherically designed  and specialty lenses toric lenses  cosmetic lenses  long term extended wear lenses and multifocal lenses 
core product revenue includes specialty lenses and single use spherical lenses 
aspheric lenses correct for near and farsightedness and have additional optical properties that help improve visual acuity in low light conditions and can correct low levels of astigmatism and low levels of presbyopia  an age related vision defect 
toric lens designs correct astigmatism by adding the additional optical properties of cylinder and axis  which correct for irregularities in the shape of the cornea 
cosmetic lenses are opaque and color enhancing lenses that alter the natural appearance of the eye 
multifocal lens designs correct presbyopia 
proclear lenses help enhance tissue device compatibility and offer improved lens comfort 
sales growth includes continued global market gains during the year  including increases in disposable spherical sales up  disposable toric sales up  disposable multifocal sales up and total toric sales up 
cvi s core product lines grew with specialty lens growth of during the year 
sales increases also resulted from the global rollout of proclear toric that increased to million and the launch of proclear multifocal lenses with sales of million 
single use lens revenue was million during the year 
sales growth was driven primarily through increases in the volume of lenses sold  as the market continues to move to more frequent replacement  including within rapidly growing specialty lenses and daily disposable spheres 
while unit growth and product mix influenced sales growth  average realized prices by product did not materially influence sales growth 
cvi results include ocular beginning on january   when cooper acquired ocular

disposable lens sales growth included spherical lens sales up  disposable toric sales up and disposable multifocal lens sales up cvi new products and markets during  cvi lost  on an organic basis  market share in the two week spherical lens market in the united states 
new product introductions during are aimed at growing our revenue and stabilizing our market share 
in january  cvi introduced biomedics xc  a two week aspheric lens featuring proclear technology 
cvi positioned this product against first generation silicone hydrogel spheres as a product with superior overall patient comfort in daily wear 
it will be available as a house brand for customers in the optical chain market  who have been unable to offer a cvi two week sphere until now  and enable practitioners to offer a new two week contact lens that is different from silicone hydrogel products 
in addition  cvi recently launched a second generation monthly silicone hydrogel spherical lens in europe and plans to introduce it in the united states in the second half of calendar an improved biomedics single use spherical lens is scheduled for launch worldwide during the first half of calendar in the toric market  cvi plans to introduce a single use toric lens in japan  where more than of the total market is single use products  in calendar in the same time frame  cvi plans to introduce a second base curve of proclear toric in the united states  effectively doubling the number of proclear parameters available for astigmatic patients 
a new two week multifocal lens  biomedics multifocal ep  specifically designed for the emerging presbyopic patient  is scheduled for introduction in calendar we anticipate that this product will also be particularly attractive to optical chains 
proclear disposable toric multifocal  proclear single use sphere with pc technology  and proclear disposable toric xr are scheduled to be introduced in the second half of calendar outlook we believe that cvi will continue to compete successfully in the worldwide contact lens market with its disposable spherical and specialty contact lenses 
in the us  market demographics are favorable  as the teenage population  the age when most contact lens wear begins  is projected to grow considerably over the next two decades 
the reported incidence of myopia continues to increase worldwide 
cvi expects greater market penetration in europe and asia as practitioners increasingly prescribe more specialty lenses 
the acquisition of ocular has produced a number of benefits to the company including new technologies  particularly patented silicone hydrogel and single use lens technologies  new geographic markets  particularly japan and germany  and higher volume manufacturing processes  particularly the gen ii platform 
cvi will continue to invest in gen ii  which it expects will generate significant gross 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued margin improvement as it continues to implement and convert products to this manufacturing platform through the end of single use lenses continue to produce double digit sales growth in all major markets 
cvi now has a strengthening presence in japan 
we anticipate that csi will continue to consolidate the women s healthcare market 
favorable demographic trends also support csi s business 
the women of the baby boomer generation are now reaching the age when gynecological procedures are performed most frequently  and csi has  through both acquisition and internal development  built an extensive product line to diagnose and treat these patients 
in november  csi acquired neosurg technologies  inc  a manufacturer of a patented combination reusable and disposable trocar access system used in laparoscopic surgery  and inlet medical  inc  a manufacturer of trocar closure systems and pelvic floor reconstruction procedure kits 
these purchases advance csi s expansion within the rapidly developing hospital segment of women s healthcare 
cooper paid about million for the two companies 
csi plans to develop a separate surgical sales force beginning in and expects additional selling and interest costs attributed to these transactions

cvi net sales cvi s revenue growth included continued global market share gains during the year with disposable toric revenue up  total toric product revenue up and disposable sphere revenue up 
cvi s line of specialty lenses grew during the year 
sales growth was driven primarily through increases in the volume of lenses sold as the market continued to move to more frequent replacement including within rapidly growing specialty lenses 
sales increases also resulted from the global rollout of proclear toric and multifocal lenses which  respectively  increased and to million and million in the twelve month period 
since the acquisition of biocompatibles in fiscal  cvi has actively marketed proclear lenses 
in many cases  practitioners now recommend proclear lenses rather than older cvi products 
while unit growth and product mix influenced revenue growth  average realized prices by product did not materially influence revenue growth 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued cvi net sales in millions growth reported us international total reported international sales grew in constant currency to million in  led by sales of two week and monthly sphere products  which grew million  or 
also  sales of two week and monthly toric products grew  or million 
international sales growth in was partially offset by declines in conventional spheres and torics of and  respectively 
sales in the united states grew in fiscal  primarily due to sales of two week and monthly toric products  which grew to million 
also  sales of the biocompatibles product lines  especially the sales of proclear specialty lenses  enhanced revenue growth 
cvi new products and markets during  cvi expanded its product offerings two week disposable toric lens to correct astigmatism introduced in japan  and proclear disposable multifocal  a disposable product for wearers with both presbyopia  the blurring of vision that occurs with aging  and the symptoms of dry eye syndrome  introduced in european markets

csi acquisitions see note acquisitions in november  csi purchased from privately held surx  inc  the assets and associated worldwide license rights for the laparoscopic lp and transvaginal tv product lines of its radio frequency rf bladder neck suspension technology  which uses radio frequency based thermal energy instead of implants to restore continence 
in february  cooper acquired milex products  inc milex  a manufacturer and marketer of obstetric and gynecologic products and customized print services 
milex is a leading supplier of pessaries products used to medically manage female urinary incontinence and pelvic support conditions and also supplies cancer screening products  including endometrial and endocervical

milex also publishes patient education materials that discuss prenatal and pregnancy issues  breast health  menopause and osteoporosis 
compared to and compared to cost of sales gross profit gross profit percentage of net sales cvi csi consolidated cvi s gross margin for fiscal  at  was lower than and the decrease was primarily due to the million impact related to the inventory step up adjustment recorded at the acquisition of ocular and recognized in cost of sales and million of restructuring expenses during the year 
in addition  we have lower gross margin on single use lenses that now account for about of cvi s net sales 
about of lens units are manufactured in the united kingdom 
the favorable impact of currency on revenue is offset by the unfavorable impact on manufacturing costs

csi s research and development expenditures of million  up  were for upgrading and redesign of many csi products in osteoporosis  in vitro fertilization  incontinence  assisted reproductive technology and other obstetrical and gynecological product development activities 
restructuring restructuring expenses of million in included million of non acquisition expenses resulting from changes made as a result of the integration of ocular with cvi and million related to integration activities of csi 
in connection with the january   acquisition of ocular  we are in the process of completing an integration plan to optimize operational synergies of the combined companies 
these activities include integrating duplicate facilities  expanding utilization of preferred manufacturing and distribution practices and integrating the worldwide sales and marketing organizations 
integration activities began in january and are expected to continue through we estimate that the total restructuring costs under this integration plan will be approximately million and will be reported as charges to cost of sales or restructuring costs in the consolidated statement of income

amortization of intangibles amortization of intangibles was million in  million in and million in amortization expense increased in fiscal primarily due to acquired intangible assets 
in the fiscal fourth quarter of  cooper finalized the allocation of the purchase price of ocular 
cooper adjusted its original allocation estimates by allocating an additional million to other intangible assets from goodwill and recognizing million  net of tax  of additional amortization for the fiscal year 
we have restated our quarterly financial data as if the final purchase price allocation was made at the acquisition date of january  see note selected quarterly financial data unaudited

the realized gain on derivative instruments of million relates to effective hedges in the form of interest rate swaps that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment  which were terminated and replaced with interest rate swaps that did qualify for hedge accounting treatment 
we expect the new swaps to qualify for hedge accounting through their maturities

due to the acquisition  we had million in loans on our credit facility at october   compared to million outstanding on october  on december   we amended and restated our million syndicated credit facility 
the amendment and restatement extended maturities and provided the company with additional borrowing 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued flexibility and lower overall pricing 
the amendment refinanced the million outstanding of term a and term b loans under the prior facility and is comprised of a revolving credit facility  which was increased from million to million  and a million term loan 
in addition  the company has the ability from time to time to increase the size of the revolving credit facility by up to an additional million 
keybank led the amendment process  which resulted in substantially all original syndicate banks retaining or increasing their participation in the agreement 
the amendment significantly reduces principal payment requirements in through we expect to write off about million of debt issuance costs as a result of amending the original facility 
see note subsequent events 
provision for income taxes our effective tax rate etr for fiscal was down from fiscal s etr of and fiscal s etr of 
the reduction of our etr resulted from a greater percentage of our income being taxed at rates substantially lower than the us statutory rate 
we implemented a global trading arrangement in fiscal to minimize both the taxes reported in our statement of income and the actual taxes we will have to pay when we use all the benefits of our net operating losses nol 
the global trading arrangement consisted of a restructuring of legal ownership for the cvi foreign sales and manufacturing subsidiaries

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued working capital decreased million in fiscal due to decreases of million in cash and million in marketable securities  from sales of securities  and increases of million in current accrued liabilities and accounts payable and million of short term debt 
these changes were partially offset by increases of million in inventory  million in receivables and million in current deferred tax assets and other 
the decrease in working capital is primarily due to the acquisition of ocular  however  smaller acquisitions and the effect of foreign exchange also contributed to the decrease 
at the end of fiscal  cooper s inventory months on hand was as compared to at fiscal year end cooper continued to improve its receivable collections with days of sales outstanding dso s at the end of the current year declining to days from days at october  looking forward  we expect dso s in the mid to upper s given our expectations for continued strong growth outside the united states where dso s are higher 
based on our experience and knowledge of our customers and our analysis of inventoried products and product levels  we believe that our accounts receivable and inventories are recoverable 
investing cash flows the cash outflow of million for investing activities in was driven by payments of million for acquisitions  primarily the purchase of ocular  and capital expenditures of million used primarily to expand manufacturing capacity and to continue the rollout of new information systems 
the cash outflow was partially offset by million of cash received from the sale of marketable securities 
financing cash flows the cash inflow of million from financing activities in was driven by proceeds from debt of million and million from the exercise of stock options  partially offset by repayment of debt of million  payment of debt acquisition costs of million and dividends on our common stock of million paid in the first and third quarters of off balance sheet arrangements none

on december   cooper amended and restated its existing million syndicated bank credit facility 
see note subsequent events 
risk management most of our operations outside of the united states have their local currency as their functional currency 
we are exposed to risks caused by changes in foreign exchange principally on balances denominated in other than the locations functional currency 
we have taken steps to minimize our balance sheet exposure 
we are also exposed to risks associated with changes in interest rates  as the interest rate on each of our revolving credit agreement and term loan debt varies with the london interbank offered rate 
we have decreased this interest rate risk by hedging million of variable rate debt effectively converting it to fixed rate debt for periods of three months to years and issuing fixed rate debt in the form of convertible debentures 
see note summary of significant accounting policies 
outlook we believe that cash and cash equivalents on hand of million plus cash generated by operating activities will fund future operations  capital expenditures  cash dividends and smaller acquisitions

 accounting for stock based compensation  sfas and superseded accounting 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options to be recognized in the financial statements based on their grant date fair values 
under sfas r  the pro forma disclosures previously permitted no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
sfas r was originally effective for all interim or annual periods beginning after june   with early adoption encouraged 
in april  the securities and exchange commission the sec postponed the effective date of sfas r until the issuer s first fiscal year beginning after june  in march  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab regarding the sec s interpretations of sfas r and the valuation of share based payments for public companies 
cooper will adopt sfas r in the first quarter of fiscal using the modified prospective method  which requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock upon adoption 
cooper will apply both the black scholes and binomial valuation models to estimate the fair value of share based payments to employees  which will then be amortized on a ratable basis over the requisite service period 
cooper is evaluating the requirements of sfas r and sab and expects that the adoption of sfas r on november  will have a material impact on cooper s consolidated results of operations and earnings per share beginning in the first quarter of fiscal cooper s assessment of the estimated compensation charges is affected by cooper s stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables and the related tax impact resulting in uncertainty as to whether future stock based compensation expense will be similar to the historical sfas pro forma expense 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the volatility of our stock price and employee stock option exercise behaviors 
estimates and critical accounting policies management estimates and judgments are an integral part of financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
we believe that the critical accounting policies described in this section address the more significant estimates required of management when preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap 
we consider an accounting estimate critical if changes in the estimate may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
we believe that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and resulting balances are reasonable  however  actual results could differ from the original estimates requiring adjustment to these balances in future periods 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned  based on terms of sale with the customer  where persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery has occurred  the seller s price is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
for contact lenses as well as csi medical devices  diagnostic products and surgical instruments and accessories  this primarily occurs upon product shipment  when risk of ownership transfers to our customers 
we believe our revenue recognition policies are appropriate in all circumstances  and that our policies are reflective of our customer arrangements 
we record  based on historical statistics  estimated reductions to revenue for customer incentive programs offered including cash discounts  promotional and advertising allowances  volume discounts  contractual pricing 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued allowances  rebates and specifically established customer product return programs 
while estimates are involved  historically  most of these programs have not been major factors in our business  since a high percentage of our revenue is from direct sales to doctors 
allowance for doubtful accounts our reported balance of accounts receivable  net of the allowance for doubtful accounts  represents our estimate of the amount that ultimately will be realized in cash 
we review the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts on an ongoing basis  using historical payment trends and the age of the receivables and knowledge of our individual customers 
when our analyses indicate  we increase or decrease our allowance accordingly 
however  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  additional allowances may be required 
while estimates are involved  bad debts historically have not been a significant factor given the diversity of our customer base  well established historical payment patterns and the fact that patients require satisfaction of healthcare needs in both strong and weak economies 
net realizable value of inventory in assessing the value of inventories  we must make estimates and judgments regarding aging of inventories and other relevant issues potentially affecting the saleable condition of products and estimated prices at which those products will sell 
on an ongoing basis  we review the carrying value of our inventory  measuring number of months on hand and other indications of salability  and reduce the value of inventory if there are indications that the carrying value is greater than market 
at the point of the loss recognition  a new  lower cost basis for that inventory is established  and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 
while estimates are involved  historically  obsolescence has not been a significant factor due to long product dating and lengthy product life cycles 
we target to keep  on average  about seven months of inventory on hand to maintain high customer service levels in spite of the complexity of our specialty lens product portfolio 
valuation of goodwill we account for goodwill and evaluate our goodwill balances and test them for impairment in accordance with the provisions of fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
we no longer amortize goodwill 
we test goodwill for impairment annually during the third fiscal quarter and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that impairment may exist 
we performed an impairment test in our fiscal third quarter  and our analysis indicated that we had no goodwill impairment 
the fasb statement no 
goodwill impairment test is a two step process 
initially  we compare the book value of net assets to the fair value of each reporting unit that has goodwill assigned to it 
if the fair value is determined to be less than the book value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment 
when available and as appropriate  we use comparative market multiples to corroborate fair value results 
a reporting unit is the level of reporting at which goodwill is tested for impairment 
our reporting units are the same as our business segments coopervision and coopersurgical reflecting the way that we manage our business 
our most recent estimate of fair value  at the time of our may  review and using several valuation techniques including assessing industry multiples  for cvi ranged from billion to billion compared to a carrying value of billion and for csi ranged from million to million compared to a carrying value of million 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued business combinations we routinely consummate business combinations 
we allocate the purchase price of acquisitions based on our estimates and judgments of the fair value of net assets purchased  acquisition costs incurred and intangibles other than goodwill 
on individually significant acquisitions  we utilize independent valuation experts to provide a basis in order to refine the purchase price allocation  if appropriate 
results of operations for acquired companies are included in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we must estimate our income tax expense for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process requires significant management judgments and involves estimating our current tax exposures in each jurisdiction including the impact  if any  of additional taxes resulting from tax examinations as well as judging the recoverability of deferred tax assets 
to the extent recovery of deferred tax assets is not likely based on our estimation of future taxable income in each jurisdiction  a valuation allowance is established 
tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve 
frequent changes in tax laws in each jurisdiction complicate future estimates 
to determine the quarterly tax rate  we are required to estimate full year income and the related income tax expense in each jurisdiction 
we adjust the estimated effective tax rate for the tax related to significant unusual items 
changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pre tax income can affect the overall effective tax rate  and such changes could be material

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk note numbers refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page of this form k 
the company is exposed to market risks that relate principally to changes in interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations 
the company s policy is to minimize  to the extent reasonable and practical  its exposure to the impact of changing interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations by entering into interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward exchange contracts  respectively 
the company does not enter into derivative financial instrument transactions for speculative purposes 
additional information for this item is incorporated by reference to derivatives in note summary of significant accounting policies and in note financial instruments
