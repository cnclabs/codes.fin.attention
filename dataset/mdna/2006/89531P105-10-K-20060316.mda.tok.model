these statements can sometimes be identified by our use of forward looking words such as may  will  anticipate  estimate  expect or intend 
we cannot promise you that our expectations in such forward looking statements will turn out to be correct 
our actual results could be materially different from our expectations because of various factors  including the factors discussed under risk factors in this report 
overview general 
management considers growth in net sales  gross margin  selling  general and administrative expenses  and net income as key indicators of our operating performance 
growth in net sales reflects consumer acceptance of composite decking  the demand for trex over competing products  the success of our branding strategy  the effectiveness of our distributors  and the strength of our dealer network and contractor franchise 
management emphasizes gross margin as a key measure of performance because it reflects the company s ability to price its products accurately and to manage effectively its manufacturing unit costs 
managing selling  general and administrative expenses is important to support profitable growth 
the company s investment in research and development activities  which is included in selling  general and administrative expenses  enables it to enhance manufacturing operations  develop new products and evaluate new technologies 
management considers net income to be a measure of the company s overall financial performance 
in the last two years  the company has expanded its product offerings by introducing the trex accents and trex brasilia decking product lines and the new trex designer series railing product 
sales of the trex accents product  which was launched in the fourth quarter of  accounted for approximately of total gross sales in sales of the trex brasilia product  which was introduced in the fourth quarter of  accounted for approximately of total gross sales in because these new products have a higher price per unit  the introduction of the products into the sales mix has a positive effect on total revenue 
the management of raw materials costs  the strengthening of manufacturing performance and the enhancement of product quality constitute some of the company s principal operating objectives 
in  manufacturing unit costs increased primarily because of higher costs for reclaimed polyethylene  or pe material  and lower manufacturing plant utilization resulting in part from the temporary suspension of operations of some production lines 
the company expects that new pe material sourcing and purchasing initiatives will be necessary for it to manage effectively its costs of pe material in future periods 
the company curtailed operation of approximately of its manufacturing capacity in the second half of in order to balance finished goods inventory levels with product demand 
the resulting reduction in production output contributed to higher manufacturing costs by reducing the absorption of fixed manufacturing costs 
the company continues to focus on product quality initiatives to enhance the appearance and overall quality of the entire product line 
these initiatives emphasize color consistency and other product specifications 
in addition  each manufacturing plant has added personnel to its inspection functions and finished goods packaging has been redesigned to minimize damage to the product in transit 
these initiatives have contributed to higher manufacturing costs by reducing manufacturing line efficiencies  as well as increasing labor and raw material costs 
the company continues to support its branding efforts through advertising campaigns in print publications and on television 
these expenditures supported a new  more extensive advertising campaign inaugurated by the company in the first quarter of branding expenditures in increased million over net sales 
net sales consists of sales and freight  net of returns and discounts 
the level of net sales is principally affected by sales volume and the prices paid for trex 
the company s branding and product 
table of contents differentiation strategy enables it to command premium prices over wood and to maintain price stability for trex 
to ensure adequate availability of product to meet anticipated seasonal consumer demand  the company historically has provided its distributors and dealers incentives to build inventory levels before the start of the prime deck building season 
these incentives include prompt payment discounts or extended payment terms 
gross profit 
gross profit represents the difference between net sales and cost of sales 
cost of sales consists of raw materials costs  direct labor costs  manufacturing costs and freight 
raw materials costs generally include the costs to purchase and transport waste wood fiber  pe material and pigmentation for coloring trex products 
direct labor costs include wages and benefits of personnel engaged in the manufacturing process 
manufacturing costs consist of costs of depreciation  utilities  maintenance supplies and repairs  indirect labor  including wages and benefits  and warehouse and equipment rental activities 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
the largest components of selling  general and administrative expenses are branding and other sales and marketing costs  which have increased significantly as the company has sought to build brand awareness of trex in the decking and railing market 
sales and marketing costs consist primarily of salaries  commissions and benefits paid to sales and marketing personnel  advertising expenses and other promotional costs 
general and administrative expenses include salaries and benefits of personnel engaged in research and development  procurement  accounting and other business functions  office occupancy costs attributable to these functions  and professional fees 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses have varied from quarter to quarter due  in part  to the seasonality of the company s business 
we have not yet determined the impact the adoption of sfas no 
r will have on our results of operations 
the adoption of sfas no 
r is expected to result in compensation expense that will reduce our net income 
the amount of the reduction in net income will depend on a number of factors  including the number of options granted  the vesting periods of options granted  our stock price and volatility  and employee exercise behaviors 
for information about sfas no 
r  see note to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report 
critical accounting policies  estimates and risks and uncertainties our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report 
critical accounting policies include the areas where we have made what we consider to be particularly difficult  subjective or complex judgments in making estimates  and where these estimates can significantly affect our financial results under different assumptions and conditions 
we prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
as a result  we are required to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented 
actual results could be different from these estimates 
inventories 
the company accounts for its inventories at the lower of cost last in  first out  or lifo or market value 
the company believes that its current inventory of finished goods will be saleable in the ordinary course of business and  accordingly  has not established significant reserves for estimated slow moving products or obsolescence 
the company has written down certain finished goods inventory that does not meet the company s new quality standards to its estimated market value 
the company has also written down the estimated portion of pe material and other raw materials that are not consumable to its estimated market value 
at december   the excess of the replacement cost of inventory over the lifo value of inventory was approximately million 
the company cannot estimate at this time the effect of future reductions  if any  in inventory levels on its future operating results 
the company currently anticipates that inventory levels will increase in property  plant and equipment 
at december   the company s construction in process totaled approximately million 
the construction in process consisted primarily of funds expended to complete production lines in various stages of construction at the winchester  fernley and olive branch manufacturing 
table of contents sites and to construct plastic reprocessing equipment 
the company currently expects that the production lines in process will be completed and put into service by mid pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable  the company compares the carrying values of its long lived assets  including construction in process  against the estimated undiscounted cash flows relating to those assets 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
in such event  the carrying value and the estimated useful lives of the company s long lived assets could be reduced in the future 
property  plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
the depreciable lives of these assets range from five to years 
we make estimates of the useful lives  in part  based upon historical performance of similar assets 
we periodically review the remaining estimated useful lives of our property  plant and equipment to determine if any revisions to our estimates are necessary 
changes to our estimate of the useful lives of our property  plant and equipment could have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
contingencies and other liabilities 
in july  in anticipation of relocating its corporate headquarters to dulles  virginia  the company entered into a new lease agreement 
the lease agreement provides for the initial occupancy of approximately  square feet of office space  which will increase during the lease term to approximately  square feet 
the company has reconsidered its decision to relocate its corporate headquarters and has decided not to move the headquarters 
minimum payments under the lease over the years ending december      and are million  million  million  million and million  respectively  and million thereafter 
the company believes that it will be able to sublet the dulles  virginia office space on favorable terms and  accordingly  has not recorded a loss related to the lease as of december  the inability to sublet the office space or changes to the company s assumptions used in its estimate of expected cash flows may result in a loss in the future 
the company is subject  from time to time  to various lawsuits and other claims related to patent infringement  product liability and other matters 
the company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
the company makes a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies after an analysis of each lawsuit and claim 
the required reserves may change in the future as a result of new developments in any such matter or changes in approach  such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with a particular matter 
in the opinion of management  adequate provision has been made for any probable losses as of december  revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue when title is transferred to customers  which is generally upon shipment of the product to the customer from the company s manufacturing facilities 
pursuant to emerging issues task force issue  accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs  the company records all shipping and handling fees in net sales and records all of the related costs in cost of sales 
the company offers several programs to dealers and distributors  including cash rebates  sales incentives and cooperative advertising 
the company accounts for these programs as either reductions to sales or as selling  general and administrative expenses in accordance with eitf issue  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products 
valuation of deferred tax assets 
the company provides for valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
in evaluating the recovery of deferred tax assets  the company makes certain assumptions as to the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences  and estimated future taxable income 
the valuation allowance can also be affected by changes to tax laws and changes to statutory tax rates 
it is possible that the facts underlying these assumptions may not materialize in future periods  which may require the company to record additional deferred tax valuation allowances  or to reduce previously recorded valuation allowances 
at december   the company had a valuation allowance of million related primarily to uncertainty regarding the recoverability of certain state tax credit carryforwards and incentives
