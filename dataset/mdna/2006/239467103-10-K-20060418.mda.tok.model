item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
recent developments during fiscal years and  daxor made major changes in the blood volume analyzer 
it expanded its research and development staff see r d section 
in january   it hired  on a permanent basis  the employees of tennessee valley software  and leased a second site in oak ridge  tennessee 
because of the ongoing changes the company will be first ready to obtain an underwriters laboratories and a ce mark which is required for marketing in europe in the second quarter of the company has also recognized that it needs to expand research projects that will provide validation on a cost benefit basis for the blood volume analyzer 
in the year  the company obtained new equipment approved by the fda which enables frozen blood to be used for up to days after thawing 
the company has purchased this equipment and has been testing it for the past year using purchased blood 
the company is in the process of negotiating with several hospitals for a blood optimization program which will enable individuals to freeze their own blood months in advance of surgery 
this program is coupled with the use of the blood volume analyzer so as to prevent patients from donating excessive amounts of blood and entering surgery in a blood depleted state 
because of the company s limited resources  the company will devote a larger portion of its efforts towards the blood volume analyzer 
daxor has continued to expand its research and marketing staff 
the company intends to increase its marketing efforts to add to its operational income 
some of the steps the company had undertaken  such as consolidating certain manufacturing facilities at oak ridge  tennessee and simultaneously contracting with an original equipment manufacturer oem will permit greater economies of scale 
the company s primary focus will be to increase operating revenues even if this initially results in increasing losses 
results of operations operating revenues in revenue from operations was  vs 
revenue from operations was  for an increase of 
in  operating revenues were  the figures for and have been restated 
idant laboratories subsidiary contributed   and of operating revenues in  and respectively 
equipment sales and kit sales increased from  to  in the company sold only a single blood volume analyzer because hospitals which had equipment on trial delayed making a commitment because medicare had made an error on reimbursement 
this error was not corrected for months 
despite this  kit sales increased over kit sales in increased over  and kit sales in increased over  patients  utilizing the bva  had blood volume measurements in vs 
 in  and  in the american college of cardiology in its most recent update of guidelines for treating congestive heart failure  for the first time specifically referenced studies partially supported by daxor on the treatment of congestive heart failure 
these studies from columbia presbyterian medical center demonstrated that the goal of achieving normal blood volume resulted in a much higher survival rate as compared to patients who remained in a hypervolemic state expanded blood volume 
the studies further demonstrated that physicians using the standard clinical and laboratory techniques to evaluate blood volume were only correct of the time  and incorrect of the time 
these studies  which are further described elsewhere in this report  were very important to the company in its goal of achieving blood volume measurement as a standard of care in treating heart failure 
at the present time  the company considers itself to still be in the earliest stages of achieving this goal 
the company s operations in semen banking and blood banking laboratories have received limited promotion  however  the company has taken steps to increase awareness of these services 
the potential market for the blood volume analyzer is significantly larger than the company s current operations 
the company anticipates that proceeds from daxor s blood volume analyzer will be the primary source of revenue in the immediate future 
the company believes that the potential market for blood volume measurement and analysis is between million tests per year 
successful penetration of even a small fraction of the market would significantly change the company s structure 
dividend income dividend income earned on the company s securities portfolio was  vs 
 reported in  for an increase of  or 
 of the increase was due to a one time special stock dividend related to a utility company merger 
in  dividend income was investment gains gains on the sale of investments were  in vs 
 in  and  in the sum of dividend income plus investment gain from sale of securities was  in   in  and  in operating expenses year ended december  as compared to december  vs 
december  operating expenses daxor s expenses from operations totaled  in  the loss from operations was  for in expenses from operations totaled  the loss from operations was  in  expenses from operations totaled  the loss from operations totaled  the increase in operating costs in was due to increased hiring of personnel related to expanded research and development expenses  as well as expanded marketing related to the blood volume analyzer 
the company had a major change in its blood volume analyzer see research and development 
the company intends to continue to expand its research and development efforts as well as its marketing efforts 
the company anticipated these increased operating expenses and intends to continue expanding its research and marketing staff 
the company experienced the largest operating loss in its history 
these losses were only partially offset by investment company income 
the company has expanded its research staff in oak ridge  tennessee and currently has a pilot manufacturing facility 
in the company reviewed plans for building a full scale manufacturing facility in oak ridge  tennessee  which would enable it to manufacture both its own volumex kits as well as build other advanced medical instruments such as an instrument to automate the glomerular filtration test 
it was decided that the timing of the implementation of this plan would depend on the rate of acceptance of the blood volume analayzer by the medical community 
liquidity and capital resources the company s management has pursued a policy of maintaining sufficient liquidity and capital resources in order to assure continued availability of necessary funds for the viability and projected growth of all ongoing projects 
at december   the company had  in short term debt vs 
 in at year end  stockholders equity was  at year end vs 
total shareholder equity was  at year end 
at december  the company s security portfolio had a market value of  vs 
 in in  the company s total liabilities and stockholders equity were  vs 
 in 
operating revenues increased to  in from  in income from the company s security portfolio is a major asset for the company as it expands its research and marketing staff 
year end finds the company in a satisfactory financial position with adequate funds available for its immediate and anticipated needs 
the company plans its budgetary outlays on the assumption that the raising of additional financial capital may be difficult in the next to years 
the company believes that its present liquidity and assets are adequate to sustain the additional expenses associated with an expanding sales and marketing program 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s condensed consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
the company considers the following accounting policies to be critical accounting policies 
available for sale securities available for sale securities represent investments in debt and equity securities primarily common and preferred stock of utility companies that management has determined meet the definition of available for sale under sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
accordingly  these investments are stated at fair market value and all unrealized holding gains or losses are recorded in the stockholders equity section as accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
conversely  all realized gains  losses and earnings are recorded in the statement of operations under other income expense 
the company will also engage in the short selling of stock 
when this occurs  the short position is marked to the market and this adjustment is recorded in the statement of operations 
any gain or loss is recorded for the period presented historical cost is used by the company to determine all gains and losses  and fair market value is obtained by readily available market quotes on all securities 
the company s investment goals  strategies and policies are as follows the company s investment goals are capital preservation and maintaining returns on this capital with a high degree of safety the company maintains a diversified securities portfolio comprised primarily of electric utility preferred and common stocks 
the company also sells covered calls on portions of its portfolio and also sells puts on stocks it is willing to own 
it also sells uncovered calls and will engage in short position up to of the value of its portfolio 
the company s investment policy is to maintain a minimum of of its portfolio in electric utilities 
investments in utilities are primarily in electric companies 
investments in non utility stocks will not exceed of the portfolio 
investment in speculative issues  including short sales  maximum of 
limited use of options to increase yearly investment income 
a 
the use of call options 
covered options can be sold up to a maximum of of the value of the portfolio 
this provides extra income in addition to dividends received from the company s investments 
the risk of this strategy is that investments may be called away  which the company may have preferred to retain 
therefore  a limitation of is placed on the amount of stock on which options which can be written 
the amount of the portfolio on which options are actually written is usually between of the portfolio 
in actual practice  more than of the options that are written expire unexercised 
the actual turnover of the portfolio is such that the average holding period is in excess of years 
b 
the use of put options 
put options are written on stocks which the company is willing to purchase 
while the company does not have a high rate of turnover in its portfolio  there is some turnover  for example  due to preferred stocks being called back by the issuing company  or stocks being called away because call options have been written 
the use of put options is a conservative strategy which enables the company to buy stocks at a lower price than the prevailing market 
if the stock does not go to the put exercise price  then the company receives the unexercised option price 
if the put is exercised  the company obtains its stock at a lower price and has the additional benefit of a lower basis cost because the option price is incorporated into the cost basis 
for example  if a stock is selling at per share and the company sells a put for at  if the stock drops to  the exercise price is  the effective cost to the company  however  is only per share 
the company may or may not sell calls against a stock it has acquired this way  or it may retain the stock 
in either case  the company benefits by acquiring the stock at a lower price than prevailed at the time it indicated an interest in this particular stock 
c 
speculative short sales short options 
the company limits its speculative transaction to of the portfolio value of the assets 
the company may sell uncovered calls on certain stocks 
if the stock price does not rise to the price of the calls  the option is not exercised  and the company receives the income from the call 
if the call is exercised  the company is then short the stock 
the company then has the choice of covering the short stock  or selling a put against its short stock 
if the put is exercised  then the short sale is covered 
the company s current accounting policy is to mark to the market each quarter any short positions  and include it in the income statement 
while the company may have so called speculative positions equal to of its accounts  in actual practice there are most quarters where short stock positions account for less than of the assets of the company 
the income derived from these investments has been essential to offset the research  operating and marketing expenses of developing the blood volume analyzer 
the company has followed a conservative policy of assuring adequate liquidity so that it can expand its marketing and research development without the sudden necessity of raising additional capital 
the securities in the company s portfolio are selected to provide stability of both income and capital 
the company has been able to achieve financial stability because of these returns  which covered a significant portion of the company s continuing losses from operations 
investment policy is reviewed at least once yearly by the board of directors and the audit committee 
individual investment decisions are made solely by dr 
joseph feldschuh  ceo  who devotes approximately to of his time to hours per week to this activity 
he is assisted by a single half time employee 
no other member of the company is involved in individual investment decisions 
revenue recognition the company recognizes operational revenues from several sources 
the first source is the outright sale of equipment  the blood volume analyzer  to customers 
the second source is the sale and associated shipping revenues of single use radioisotope doses volumex that are injected into the patient and measured by the blood volume analyzer 
the third source of revenue is service contracts on the blood volume analyzer  after it has been sold to a customer 
the fourth source of revenue is the storage fees associated with cryobanked blood and semen specimens 
the fifth is lab revenues from laboratory services  and the sixth is revenue from semen sales 
the company currently offers three different methods of purchasing the blood volume analyzer equipment 
a customer may purchase the equipment directly  lease the equipment  or rent the equipment on a month to month basis 
the revenues generated by a direct sale or a monthly rental are recognized as revenue in the period in which the sale or rental occurred 
if a customer is to select the lease option  the company refers its customer to a third party finance company with which it has established a relationship  and if the lease is approved  the company receives of the sales proceeds from the finance company and recognizes of the revenue 
the finance company then deals directly with the customer with regard to lease payments and related collections 
daxor corporation does not guarantee payments to the leasing company 
the sales of the single use radioisotope doses volumex that are used in conjunction with the blood volume analyzer are recognized as revenue in the period in which the sale occurred 
when blood volume analyzer equipment has been sold to a customer  the company offers a one year warranty on the product  which covers all mechanical failures 
this one year warranty is effective on the date of sale of the equipment 
after the one year period expires  customers may purchase a service contract through the company  which is usually offered in one year  three year or five year increments 
prior to q  these service contracts were recorded by the company as deferred revenue and were amortized into income in the period in which they apply 
currently  all service contracts  regardless of length of term  are billed quarterly in the period in which the revenue is earned 
the storage fees associated with the cryobanked blood and semen samples are recognized as income in the period for which the fee applies 
the company invoices customers for storage fees for various time periods 
these time periods range from one month up to one  two or three years 
the company will only recognize revenue for those storage fees that are earned in the current reporting period  and will defer the remaining revenues to the period in which they are earned 
effective october   the company has altered our billing procedure as such that clients will only be billed on a quarterly basis 
therefore  future revenue recognition will not include deferred revenue on the storage fees  but rather will be earned in the same period in which the invoices are generated 
comprehensive income loss the company reports components of comprehensive income under the requirements of sfas no 
 reporting comprehensive income 
this statement establishes rules for the reporting of comprehensive income and requires certain transactions to be presented as separate components of stockholders equity 
the company currently reports the unrealized holding gains and losses on available for sale securities  net of deferred taxes  as accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
product warrantees and related liabilities the company offers a one year warranty on the blood volume analyzer equipment 
this warranty is effective on the date of sale and covers all mechanical failures of the equipment 
all major components of the equipment are purchased and warranteed by the original rd party manufacturers 
once the initial one year warranty period has expired  customers may purchase annual service contracts for the equipment 
these service contracts warranty the mechanical failures of the equipment that are not associated with normal wear and tear of the components 
to date  the company has not experienced any major mechanical failures on any equipment sold 
in addition  the majority of the potential liability would revert to the original manufacturer 
due to this history  a liability has not been recorded with respect to product warranty liability 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the dates of the financial statements and the results of operations during the reporting periods 
these also include management estimates in the calculation of pension liabilities covering discount rates  return on plan assets and other actuarial assumptions 
although these estimates are based upon management s best knowledge of current events and actions  actual results could differ from those estimates income taxes the company accounts for income taxes under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this pronouncement requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the estimated future tax consequences of event attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of changes in tax rates is recognized in the statement of operations in the period in which the enactment rate changes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are reduced through the establishment of a valuation allowance at such time as  based on available evidence  it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
impact of restatements for and as a result of the audit a number of changes were made with respect to balance sheet  profit and loss  and summary 
the changes that were made  effective for through to the present  pertained to three areas change in revenue recognition for cryobanking from cash to accrual method 
change in valuation of certain investments options and shorts from cost to mark to market  with the fair market value adjustment on the options and shorts running through the statement of operations 
change in the method of accounting for the blood volume analyzer equipment that is out on loan rental 
we now capitalize and depreciate the equipment instead of expensing it directly to cost of goods 
the following tables provide the numerical impact of these changes as as originally as increase originally as increase reported restated decrease reported restated decrease current assets cash and cash equivalents available for sale securities other receivable accounts receivable inventory prepaid expenses and other current assets total current assets property and equipment  net other assets total assets current liabilities accounts payable and accrued liabilities loans payable deferred option premiums other liabilities deferred revenue deferred taxes total current liabilities and total liabilities stockholders equity common stock additional paid in capital accumulated other comprehensive income retained earnings treasury stock total stockholders equity total liabilities and stockholders equity contractual obligations in december  the company signed a new ten year lease commencing january   for its existing facility at the empire state building 
the company has occupied this space since january the company currently occupies approximately  square feet 
the lease has a two year option for renewal after ten years 
there are options for an additional  square feet of space 
the company has a pilot manufacturing facility in oak ridge  tennessee which is currently manufacturing the bva blood volume analyzers  and where r d activities are performed 
the company also signed a contract with an original equipment manufacturer oem for manufacturing the bva the company s volumex syringes are filled by an fda licensed radiopharmaceutical manufacturer under contract with daxor 
tabular disclosure of contractual obligations payments due by period contractual obligations total year years years more than years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on the registrant s balance sheet under gaap total this amount represents a total monthly rental fee of  paid for our new york facilities  base rent of  add l 
space at th avenue at it does not include the monthly rent paid in tennessee  as these facilities are rented on a month to month basis and can be terminated at any time 
recent accounting pronouncements although we have not yet determined whether the adoption of sfas r will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas  we are evaluating the requirements under sfas r and do not expect the adoption to have a significant impact on our statements of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in light of the safe harbor provisions so that a company could not be considered an investment company  we have done an analysis of what would have occurred if the company had elected to use a safe harbor provision instead of the cash management program that it developed which utilizes dividend paying utilities combined with option sales 
it should be noted that it is not mandatory to utilize t bills  only that it is a safe harbor provision  where one is not required to explain or justify that one is an operating company rather than in investment company 
we elected to augment the company s revenue rather than accept the safe harbor t bill scenario 
we understood that there were risks  and the concept was approved by the board of directors of daxor before this policy was inaugurated 
the original concept was suggested to us by a broker who has had a relationship with the company for over years 
the board of directors reviews and approves the investment policy at least once a year 
the policy is the primary investments are in electric utilities  no more than of the company s assets can be in shorts at any one time  the company can continue to sell covered call options  sell naked put options on securities it is willing to own  concentration of no more than of any one stock in the portfolio  if a stock were to grow to more than due to natural increase in value  it is exempt from the concentration rule 
all individual investment decisions are made by dr 
joseph feldschuh 
dr 
feldschuh spends approximately of his time approximately hours per week on reviewing information relative to investment decisions  as well as transmitting instructions concerning these decisions 
a single half time administrative employee provides assistance to dr 
feldschuh 
no other employee is involved in investment making decisions 
the company subscribes to two independent investment economic newsletters and three financial newspapers 
the company also receives free investment analysis from the two primary brokerage houses where it has corporate accounts 
the company has always had on its board of directors  for at past the last twenty years  at least one person who could be considered an expert on investing accounting policy with wall street experience 
in  the company had its cash management investment policies questioned by the sec and no action was taken against the company 
the following graphs illustrate what would have happened to the company if the company had chosen at that time  beginning in  to undertake a so called safe harbor policy 
two separate t bill rates were used for this analysis  one for an average rate of approximately  and one for an average rate of approximately 
the and scenarios are reasonable approximations of which the company might have encountered during this time 
during this time period t bill interest rates fluctuated between approximately and 
graph comparison of net earnings with hypothetical earnings that would have resulted had the company invested in treasury bills from to and received a interest rate 
graph 
graph illustrates three sets of data from to the company s reported net income from all sources  the company s operation income minus operating expenses  and a hypothetical net income calculated assuming that  rather than following its existing investment policy  the company had invested in treasury bills and received an interest rate of 
from to  the company reported a net profit despite increasing losses from operations 
as can be seen  from through  operating revenues did not cover expenses 
from  despite heavy operating losses  the company was close to breaking even 
in the company lost between  and  each year despite supplemental revenue from investments 
had the company invested in treasury bills and received a interest rate  all years would have shown a loss 
from  the company would have lost approximately million each year 
in  the company would have lost nearly million  in over million  and in approximately over million 
graph comparison of net earnings with hypothetical earnings that would have resulted had the company invested in treasury bills from to and received a interest rate 
graph 
graph shows the same basic scenario as graph  except that the hypothetical net income was calculated assuming a interest rate from treasury bills 
the results are similar to those from graph  but the loss is slightly lower because of the higher interest rate 
graph hypothetical change in company assets that would have occurred had persistent losses from investment in treasury bills with a rate of interest forced the company to cover losses by liquidating sections of its portfolio 
graph 
graph compares the company s marketable securities at cost with a hypothetical value of securities 
this hypothetical value was calculated assuming that the company had begun investing in treasury bills in and received a interest rate 
the marketable securities at cost approximately represent the amount of money the company has available  or its approximate assets 
using our existing investment policy  the value of our marketable securities at cost has slowly decreased over the last years but has begun to slowly increase since had the company invested in treasury bills  because of the continuing net loss as demonstrated in graph  the company would have been forced to steadily sell investment capital to cover those losses 
the calculations take this dwindling supply of capital into account 
lost capital would only have been partially replaced by interest on the treasury bills  and the amount of investment income would have declined as the amount of capital decreased 
by year end  the value of the company s securities would have dwindled to approximately million  from a starting point of over million 
by year end  the estimated value of the securities would have fallen to approximately million 
the company would be facing potential bankruptcy in graph hypothetical change in company assets that would have occurred had persistent losses from investment in treasury bills with a rate of interest forced the company to cover losses by liquidating sections of its portfolio 
graph 
graph illustrates the same scenario as graph  but assuming a interest rate from treasury bills 
the loss is somewhat less in this scenario  but by year end  securities would have fallen to approximately million  and the estimated value of the securities by would have been approximately million 
graph loans payable per year 
graph 
graph illustrates the company s loans payable at december from to from to  the amount of loans payable decreased sharply  and then stayed in a narrow range from to  remaining below million and reaching a low of million at december  after  because of the company s expanded research and development  the amount of loans began to increase steadily until december   when they exceeded the amount 
had the company invested in treasury bills  this would have led by year end to a combination of depleted capital  increased debt  and looming bankruptcy 
graph operating revenues and total expenses from to 
graph 
graph illustrates operational revenues and total expenses from to estimated operational revenues dropped sharply between and between and  operational revenues began to recover  but they have not yet reached pre levels 
expenses were fairly constant between and  but they have increased since because of the expansion in research  development  and marketing 
throughout the entire twelve years  operating expenses have consistently exceeded operating revenues 
graph marketable securities at cost compared to the rate of return 
graph 
graph shows the cost of securities compared with rate of return investment income cost of securities from to the rate of return includes dividends and net profits from security sales  but it does not include unrealized profits 
had these been included  the rate of return would have been higher 
the actual rate of return is more than three times the rate of return that the company would have received if the company had invested exclusively in treasury bills 
the company  therefore  has benefited from the cash management policy of the past years
