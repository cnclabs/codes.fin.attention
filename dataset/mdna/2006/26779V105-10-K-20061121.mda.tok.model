item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our management s discussion and analysis includes forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ substantially from the statements we make in this section due to a number of factors that are discussed in item a risk factors 
during  we classified as discontinued operations our baton rouge and west houston facilities and are seeking a buyer for each of these facilities 
our operating results for all periods presented reflect these operations as discontinued 
executive summary asset held for sale and discontinued operations in  the company decided to sell the assets related to the baton rouge and west houston facilities  since those operations were not core to our long term objectives and are not performing consistently with the expectations we had for them at the time we made the investment 
the company has also made the decision to sell its land in the woodlands  texas  since it no longer intends to build on that site 
none of those assets is encumbered by secured lien or debt  so all proceeds from the sale of any of those assets  net of selling expenses  would be available to pay down the existing revolving credit facility which is based on eligible accounts receivable  improve liquidity for the company s day to day operations  and invest in the company s core business activities  including the china project 
private placement in may  the company offered for sale shares of its common stock to a limited number of accredited investors in a private placement at a purchase price of per share  which was of the market price of company stock on the offering date 
a total of  shares were sold  resulting in sales proceeds of  the shares are restricted securities which may not be offered or sold publicly in the united states except pursuant to the effectiveness of a registration statement or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the securities act 
the sales proceeds were used to meet the cash needs of the company s day to day operations 
net patient service revenues net patient service revenues declined million  or  compared to the prior year period  to million  as net patient service revenue from our garland facility increased by million or  partially offsetting a decline of million in net patient service revenue at the pasadena facility 
approximately  and of the company s net patient service revenue for fiscal years  and  respectively  were generated at the company s pasadena facility 
the garland facility contributed  and in net patient service revenues in fiscal years  and  respectively 
during fiscal years  and  approximately  and of the company s gross revenues came from surgeries covered by workers compensation  and approximately  and came from services covered by commercial and other insurance payers  respectively 
the decline in net patient service revenues is due to several reasons discussed below reimbursement by workers compensation insurance payers below the tdwc fee guideline increase in competition for specialized surgeons decrease in average net patient service revenue per case reimbursement by workers compensation insurance payers 
table of contents the majority of our gross patient service revenues continues to come from surgeries covered by workers compensation 
the reimbursement being made to us by the insurance payers is at a rate which is below the tdwc fee guideline 
the lower reimbursement rate reduces our historical cash collection rate  which in turn decreases our net patient service revenues 
see accounts receivable for a description of the receivables associated with workers compensation 
increase in competition for specialized surgeons the houston market has recently experienced an increase in the number of surgical hospitals  which has increased the competition for specialized surgeons 
the number of bariatric surgeries performed at our pasadena facility decreased and in and  respectively  compared to the prior fiscal years 
this decrease has been partially offset by a increase  or additional bariatric surgeries in compared to at our garland facility 
similarly  inpatient orthopedic surgeries at our pasadena facility dropped and in and  respectively  compared to prior fiscal years 
in fiscal year  we added a net of physicians to the staff at the pasadena facility and at the garland facility 
of the net physicians added  specialize in orthopedics and pain management  in general and vascular surgery and in bariatric surgery 
the remaining are hospital based physicians who do not generally make referrals to our hospitals or directly generate patient revenues 
these additions to our medical staffs have not yet resulted in a material increase in net patient revenues in or  and as such  the referral rates have not replaced the referral rates of the physicians who left the staff of our pasadena facility in fiscal the utilization rate of our hospitals varies widely among physicians on our medical staffs and among specializations  so an increase in the number of physicians on our medical staffs does not  in itself  result in an increase in patient referrals or revenues 
while we attempt to continue to attract and retain additional physicians  the potential loss of physicians who provide significant net patient revenues for the company may adversely affect our results of operations 
decrease in average net patient service revenue per case even though the number of cases decreased only overall in compared to  the net patient service revenue fell by 
this is primarily due to poor reimbursement by workers compensation insurance payers as mentioned above  and a larger decrease in the number of inpatient cases  which typically generate a higher reimbursement rate compared to an outpatient case 
the number of inpatient cases dropped  or  from to update on mdrs following the recent procedural changes implemented by the tdwc on september  regarding appeals in the mdr process  the company has sought judicial review of tdwc s decisions regarding reimbursement for inpatient and outpatient surgical services at both the administrative level at soah and at the district court level in the travis county district courts 
however  these procedural changes  coupled with the uncertainty created by the lack of an accepted interpretation of the stop loss methodology  have prevented many  if not all  of the stop loss cases at all levels of the mdr process from moving forward 
however  in july of  the en banc panel which presides over the consolidated stop loss docket at soah and which consists of nine administrative law judges  issued a schedule establishing deadlines for both the carriers and the providers to submit briefs regarding the stop loss issue and for scheduling oral argument 
the carriers and the providers submitted their respective briefs  and on november  the en banc panel heard the arguments of both the carriers and providers  but has not yet issued a decision regarding the stop loss issue 
inpatient stop loss cases pending at soah and in the travis county district courts are currently awaiting a decision by the en banc panel and final interpretation of the stop loss methodology 
the travis county district court has suggested that it will wait for a decision at soah regarding the stop loss issue 
the mdr process  as it relates to the company s outpatient surgical services disputes  has made significant progress in the last days 
these cases have been divided into four consolidated dockets  one of which is in the 
table of contents beginning stages of an expedited discovery period  culminating in the scheduling of trial as early as mid january for cases with dates of service from operating losses our net loss of million for fiscal year is primarily due to declining revenues discussed above 
the net loss includes approximately  of non recurring items comprised of the class action lawsuit settlement expense of million  partially offset by a medicare refund of  for an overpayment settlement  and an extraordinary gain of  from the buyback of minority interests held in our facilities 
marketing our marketing efforts are directed primarily at physicians and other healthcare professionals who are principally responsible for referring patients to our facilities 
we market our facilities to physicians by emphasizing the high level of patient satisfaction with our hospitals  the quality and responsiveness of our services and the practice efficiencies provided by our facilities 
we believe that providing quality facilities creates a positive environment for patients and physicians 
the company  through its subsidiaries  also has agreements with outside organizations that offer marketing  pre authorization and follow up support services to prospective orthopedic and or bariatric patients in areas serviced by the pasadena and or garland facilities 
these facilities receive orthopedic and bariatric referrals from other sources  and such organizations also refer clients to other area hospitals 
in addition to our arrangements with outside organizations regarding marketing  we have implemented new bariatric or weight control programs at the pasadena facility in the first quarter of fiscal and at the garland facility in the second quarter of fiscal  to replace the former bariatric programs at those facilities and to reduce costs associated with outside vendor programs 
our new programs provide or contract for marketing  pre authorization and follow up support services to prospective bariatric patients in areas serviced by the pasadena or garland facilities 
the new bariatric programs have resulted in some bariatric cases  however the number of cases generated will have to improve substantially for such programs to become profitable 
internal controls our outside auditors have advised that there were no identified material weaknesses in our internal controls at august  see item a 
controls and procedures 
revenue recognition historically  we have not been a party to managed care contracts 
we recognize revenue based upon our estimate of the amount of cash which we will collect for the services delivered 
we estimate that we will collect the same percentage of our gross invoices for each facility on a case by case basis in each period as we have actually collected during the trailing months 
what we term contractual allowance is the amount which must be subtracted from gross billed charges to arrive at the net patient service revenue 
for the years ended august   and  our aggregate contractual allowance  as a percentage of gross billed revenues  was  and  respectively 
accounts receivable the focus of our business is relatively complex cases with corresponding large facility reimbursements 
our gross patient service revenue was generated from service to injured texas workers worker s compensation and from out of network commercial insurance 
the principal cases involved were orthopedic spine surgeries and bariatric surgeries for the morbidly obese  respectively 
our accounts receivable are larger and older than those of typical healthcare companies because of our pursuit of additional reimbursements through the mdr process 
historically the company has not participated in managed care contracts and has not received a substantial amount of reimbursement from medicare or medicaid 
however  during the first quarter of fiscal  the company began participation in certain managed care contracts and anticipates entering into additional contracts 
table of contents in the future 
so far these contracts have not resulted in any meaningful patient revenues 
following our approach to revenue recognition  we initially subtract the contractual allowance from the gross receivables 
we then subtract an allowance for uncollectible accounts or bad debt reserve  which we estimate at of total outpatient revenue 
the great bulk of our receivables are due from insurance carriers 
the mdr process  which is described in detail below  has been curtailed for three years 
however  in the summer of some progress was made in the mdr process  only to be abated again pending a decision regarding the constitutionality of the mdr appellate process as enforced under the workers compensation act 
final determination of the mdr process will remain abated until the travis county district courts render a decision on the appropriate method for resolving pending claims 
because of this extended uncertainty in the mdr process  we do not arbitrarily write off mdr receivables 
we evaluate mdr receivables to estimate the amount that should be collected 
if that estimate is less than the gross receivables net of contractual allowance and allowance for uncollectible accounts  we then write it down to the estimated collectible amount 
at each balance sheet date we also separately classify as long term receivables all receivables that we expect to collect more than one year from the balance sheet date 
the mdr system as of september  has changed significantly 
the system is important to an understanding of our financial statements 
the following information provides a more detailed description of the mdr process  as well as others of our critical accounting policies and estimates 
critical accounting policies and estimates the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements contain information that is pertinent to the management s discussion and analysis 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities 
management believes these accounting policies involve judgment due to the significant assumptions and estimates necessary in determining the related asset and liability amounts 
management believes it has exercised proper judgment in determining these estimates based on the facts and circumstances available to its management at the time the estimates were made 
the significant accounting policies are described in the company s financial statements see note in notes to the consolidated financial statements 
of these policies  management believes the following ones may involve a comparatively higher degree of judgment and complexity 
we have discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition background the company s revenue recognition policy is significant because net patient service revenue is a primary component of its results of operations 
revenue is recognized as services are delivered 
the determination of the amount of revenue to recognize in connection with the company s services is subject to significant judgments and estimates  which are discussed below 
revenue recognition policy historically  the company has not participated in managed care contracts 
however  during the first quarter of fiscal  the company began participation in certain managed care contracts and anticipates entering into additional contracts in the future 
so far these contracts have not resulted in any meaningful patient revenues 
the company records revenue pursuant to the following policy 
the company has established billing rates for its medical services that it bills as gross revenue as services are delivered 
gross billed revenues are then reduced by the company s estimate of the discount contractual allowance to arrive at net patient service revenues 
net patient service revenues are based on historical cash collections as discussed below and may not represent amounts ultimately expected to be collected 
at such time as the company can determine that ultimate collections exceeded 
table of contents or have been less than the revenue recorded on a group of accounts  additional revenue or reduction in revenue is recorded 
the table below sets forth the percentage of our gross patient service revenue by financial class for the fiscal years  and workers compensation commercial medicare medicaid self pay other contractual allowance the company computes its contractual allowance based on the ratio of the company s historical cash collections during the trailing twelve months to gross billed revenue on a case by case basis by operating facility 
this ratio of cash collections to billed services is then applied to the gross billed services by operating facility 
the following table shows gross revenues and contractual allowances for fiscal years  and year ended august  gross billed charges contractual allowance net revenue contractual allowance percentage accounts receivable accounts receivable represent net receivables for services provided by the company 
the estimated accounts receivable not expected to be collected within twelve months of the balance sheet date have been shown as long term receivables and represent receivables that are in the mdr process and legal third party financial class 
the contractual allowance is provided as revenue is recognized 
at each balance sheet date  management reviews the accounts receivables for collectibility 
if after the review management believes certain receivables are uncollectible  the receivables are written down to the expected collectible amount 
the following table shows accounts receivable  the contractual allowance  the allowance for uncollectible accounts  net receivables and the contractual allowance as a percent of gross receivables at august  and current portion of gross receivables current portion of contractual allowance current portion of allowance for uncollectible accounts net current portion of accounts receivable contractual allowance and allowance for uncollectible accounts as a percentage of current gross receivables long term portion of gross receivables long term portion of contractual allowance long term portion of allowance for uncollectible accounts net long term portion of accounts receivable contractual allowance and allowance for uncollectible accounts as a percentage of long term gross receivables 
table of contents the contractual allowance stated as a percentage of gross receivables at the balance sheet dates is larger than the contractual allowance percentage used to reduce gross billed charges due to the application of partial cash collections to the outstanding gross receivable balances  without any adjustment being made to the contractual allowance 
the contractual allowance amounts netted against gross receivables are not adjusted until such time as the final collections on an individual receivable are recognized 
collections for services provided are generally settled or written off as uncollectible against the contractual allowance within six months of the date of service except for services provided to injured workers in texas 
because the company has in recent years focused on providing services to injured workers in texas  accounts receivable in the workers compensation mdr process have increased 
the mdr process is an established reimbursement resolution process available to providers of healthcare services under the regulations guiding reimbursement for services provided to injured workers in the state of texas 
accounts generally do not become subject to the mdr process prior to being outstanding for at least days subsequent to patient discharge 
for medical services provided to injured workers in the state of texas  the mdr process is specifically based upon the administrative and statutory regulations promulgated by the texas labor code  the texas administrative code and the texas insurance code 
the company  in conjunction with most of the texas hospital medical providers  continues its efforts to resolve the pending claims regarding payment for the treatment of injured workers under the texas workers compensation laws 
if any reimbursement provided by a workers compensation carrier is improper pursuant to the statutory or regulatory guidelines administered by the tdwc  our facilities request and pursue additional reimbursement 
following is a brief discussion on the time line of a typical workers compensation claim bills are submitted to a carrier within days of date of service 
a carrier has days to respond to provider with payment or an explanation of benefits eob indicating the rationale of denial or defense to payment 
the company forwards a request for reconsideration rfr to a carrier after the th day of the carrier s receipt of the bill or after receipt of the eob 
the carrier has days to respond to the rfr 
should the carrier fail to respond or provide the reimbursement requested  the company files a request with the mdr division of the tdwc 
this usually occurs at or about six to eight months after the date of service due to administrative requirements before filing the initial request to tdwc 
usually to days after filing the initial request with the mdr division  tdwc will review the mdr request and determine if additional information is needed 
tdwc then will forward an mr form requesting any additional documentation and rationale for additional reimbursement 
the company has days after the date of receipt of the mr to provide additional documentation and a position statement that outlines the rationale for the request for additional reimbursement 
tdwc is not required by the texas labor code or the texas administrative code to provide a finding and decision within a specific timeframe 
based upon the historical actions of the tdwc  a finding and decision is usually received within to months after the supplemental documentation was forwarded to tdwc 
however  because of the abatement to the mdr process  a final timetable will remain unknown until the constitutionality of the mdr appellate process as enforced by the workers compensation act is determined 
for mdr findings and decisions issued prior to september  
table of contents after receipt of the tdwc finding and decision  the non prevailing party has the option of appealing the decision with the soah within days of receiving the finding and decision from tdwc 
a hearing date with soah is assigned generally within days  however  this time period is usually extended to months depending on discovery requests 
soah will issue a decision to days after the contested case hearing or after final closing briefs have been filed 
the soah decision may be appealed to the district court 
for mdr findings and decisions issued after september  after receipt of the tdwc finding and decision  the non prevailing party has the option of seeking judicial review of the finding and decision by a district court in travis county  texas 
the petition is required to be filed within days of the tdwc s issuance of the mdr finding and decision 
similarly  a final timetable will remain unknown until the constitutionality of the mdr appellate process as enforced by the workers compensation act is determined 
the company has a significant number of reimbursement disputes where the mdr decision was unsatisfactory to either the insurance carrier or us  and these decisions have subsequently been appealed to the state office of administrative hearings soah or district court 
many of these cases involve the stop loss rule governing reimbursement to providers 
the company is pursuing these cases aggressively  however the number of cases that the company has in the dispute resolution process continues to grow  and payment on many of these cases will not be made until certain standards currently in dispute are established 
during the last days  significant activity occurred in the resolution of the legal issues controlling these claims 
the travis county district court has suggested that it will wait for a decision at soah regarding the stop loss issue 
the en banc panel at soah recently heard the arguments of both the carriers and providers  but has not yet issued a decision regarding the stop loss issue 
the state department of insurance  through the office of the texas attorney general  has taken a position at least partially supporting the claims made by the company and other texas hospitals 
the delays caused by the unexpected and extended abatements of the soah proceedings for both the inpatient and outpatient cases have added significantly to the age of our accounts receivable for these types of services 
if these disputes are ultimately resolved against the company s positions  it may have a material adverse effect on the financial statements 
due to a number of factors outside the company s control  including changes in the company s reimbursement collection experience associated with potential changes in the reimbursement environment in which the company operates  it is possible that management s estimates of patient service revenues could change  which could have a material impact on the company s revenue and profitability in the future 
sources of revenue and reimbursement the focal point of our business is providing patient care services  including complex orthopedic and bariatric procedures 
the company pursues optimal reimbursement from third party payers for these services 
we do not normally participate in managed care or other contractual reimbursement agreements  principally because they limit reimbursement for the medical services provided 
this business model often results in increased amounts of reimbursement for the same or similar procedure  as compared to other healthcare providers 
however  there are no contractual or administrative requirements for prompt payment of claims by third party payers within a specified time frame 
as a result  the company has tended to receive higher amounts of per procedure reimbursement than that which may be received by other healthcare providers performing similar services 
conversely  despite the increased reimbursement  we may take additional time to collect the expected reimbursement from third party payers 
during the first quarter of fiscal  the company began participation in certain managed care contracts and anticipates entering into additional contracts in the future 
so far these contracts have not resulted in any meaningful patient revenues 
increased participation in managed care contracts and programs may decrease the per procedure reimbursement that the company collects in the future for similar services 

table of contents in addition to the fact that our collection process may be longer than other healthcare providers because of our focus on workers compensation and other commercial payers  the collection process can be extended due to our efforts to obtain all optimal reimbursement available to the company 
specifically  for medical services provided to injured workers  the company may initially receive reimbursement that may not be within the fee guidelines or regulatory guidelines mandating reimbursement 
for such cases in which third party payers did not provide appropriate reimbursement pursuant to these guidelines  the company pursues further reimbursement 
the company reviews and pursues those particular claims that are determined to warrant additional reimbursement pursuant to the fee or regulatory guidelines 
the company s pursuit of additional reimbursement amounts that it believes are due under fee or regulatory guidelines may be accomplished through established dispute resolution procedures with applicable regulatory authorities 
surgeries are typically not scheduled unless they are pre authorized by the insurance carrier for medical necessity 
after the surgery  the company s automated computer system generates a statement of billed charges to the third party payer 
at that time  the company also requests payment from patients for any remaining amounts that are the responsibility of the patient 
allowance for uncollectible accounts the company has estimated uncollectible accounts expense of of gross outpatient revenue 
the company normally makes no charge offs against the allowance for uncollectible accounts  as historically all charge offs have been against the contractual allowance 
during the fiscal year ended august   the company charged  against the allowance for uncollectible accounts 
during the fiscal years ended august  and  the company made no charge offs against the allowance for uncollectible accounts 
income taxes sfas  accounting for income taxes  establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes 
the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns 
judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns

in addition  decreases in net patient service revenue per case were attributable to a change in the surgical mix of cases  and reimbursement by workers compensation insurance payers below the tdwc fee guideline 
the company computes its contractual allowance based on the ratio of the company s historical cash collections during the trailing twelve months to gross billed revenue on a case by case basis by operating facility 
in compliance with this revenue recognition policy  due to slower collections on the receivables associated with the workers compensation dispute resolution process  the company s contractual allowance as a percentage of gross patient revenue has increased from in to in total costs and expenses decreased by  or  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the following discusses the various changes in costs and expenses compensation and benefits decreased by  or

the company made a concerted effort to reduce employee costs and expenses to match the decline in revenue 
medical services and supplies expenses decreased  or  while the number of surgery cases

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks relating to the company s operations result primarily from changes in interest rates as well as credit risk concentrations 
except for the capital contributions of approximately million to date and the required future contributions of million to the dean joint venture  the majority of which are in local currency  all of the company s contracts are denominated in us dollars and  therefore  the company has no significant foreign currency risk 
interest rate risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on funded debt

the balance owed under the facility as of november  was approximately million 
borrowings under the facility bear interest at variable rates based on the libor rate plus 
based on the amount outstanding  a basis point change in the applicable interest rates would not have a material impact on the company s annual cash flow or income 
the company s cash and cash equivalents are invested in money market accounts 
accordingly  the company is subject to changes in market interest rates 
however  the company does not believe a change in these rates would have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results  financial condition and cash flows 
there is an inherent rollover risk on these funds as they accrue interest at current market rates 
the extent of this risk is not quantifiable or predictable due to the variability of future interest rates 
credit risks the company s financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of trade receivables from various private insurers 
the company monitors its exposure for credit losses and maintains allowances for anticipated losses  but does not require collateral from these parties
