item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is provided to enhance the understanding of  and should be read in conjunction with  part i  item  business and consolidated financial statements and the related notes 
for information on risks and uncertainties related to universal s business that may make past performance not indicative of future results  or cause actual results to differ materially from any forward looking statements  see forward looking and cautionary statements  and part i  item a  risk factors 
overview universal corporation  through its subsidiaries and affiliates  is one of the world s leading independent leaf tobacco merchants and processors and has operations in agri products and the distribution of lumber and building products 
the company derives most of its tobacco revenues from sales of processed tobacco to manufacturers of tobacco products throughout the world and from fees and commissions for specific services 
in the last three years  universal made significant investments in crop expansion in a number of african countries  including malawi  mozambique  and zambia  to maintain a diverse supply base as flue cured tobacco volumes continued to decline in zimbabwe 
currently  there is an oversupply of certain grades of flue cured tobacco  as supply began to outpace demand after an increase in worldwide flue cured production by exporting countries excluding china in fiscal year that increase was primarily caused by a very large  lower quality flue cured crop in brazil 
in fiscal year  brazil again produced a very large crop that was of poor quality due to adverse weather conditions 
thus  the oversupply of flue cured tobacco is primarily lower quality leaf 
burley tobacco is also in an oversupply situation due to large crops in malawi and brazil in the last two years 
during this time  us crop sizes declined as customers continued to shift to more price competitive growths in other countries 
although worldwide production of flue cured and burley tobaccos declined slightly in fiscal year  markets remained in an oversupply 
in fiscal year  the company successfully started up its new factory in mozambique  reduced excess capacity in the united states by closing a factory  undertook programs to significantly reduce overhead and to improve cash flow  and began the process of reevaluating the viability of the company s growing projects in africa 
universal s tobacco segment performance suffered in fiscal year as a result of weather problems in several countries  which either reduced crop quality or yield  the weakness of the us dollar against several foreign currencies in which it purchases tobacco  which increased costs  unusually high provisions for losses on farmer advances that arose in part because of crop quality  start up costs related to the new mozambique factory  and a decline in sales volumes for blended strips  which were no longer required by its customers 
in addition  the company recorded restructuring and impairment charges related to the closure of its danville  virginia  tobacco processing facility and an impairment charge to reduce its investment in its tobacco operations in zimbabwe to estimated fair value following the deconsolidation of that investment for accounting purposes 
the lumber and building products segment has been weathering a long term recession in europe  which showed some signs of improvement during the last quarter of fiscal year despite the effects of the recession  the strength of the euro has helped buoy us dollar translated income 
in addition  careful attention to cost control and customer service has helped the overall earnings performance of the lumber and building products group 
during the past three fiscal years  the agri products segment experienced difficult markets for many of its products  especially sunflower seeds  cashews  and almonds 
in fiscal year  results were negatively affected by losses on inventory write downs and purchase commitments in both sunflower seeds and almonds  however  market conditions improved in synthetic rubber  dried fruits  cashews  and other nuts 
absent the losses from market declines in almonds and sunflower seeds  results for this segment would have been much improved from fiscal year heavy demands for capital to diversify and expand tobacco sources  improve us processing capabilities  expand the lumber and building products business  and provide working capital for the agri products businesses over the last three years have been funded with a combination of revolving credit borrowings  public debt  and preferred stock 
the company has been working to reduce its debt levels and improve cash flow  to reduce capital spending to a level below depreciation  and to reduce working capital investment by reducing crop sizes in some areas 
the company began to see some improvement in fiscal year  as cash provided by operating activities increased by about million and cash used by investing activities decreased by million 
management will continue its efforts to improve operating results in fiscal year the company is working to reduce excess leaf production in brazil and africa  and to reduce capital spending and working capital investment 
universal is also reviewing marginal operations  including growing projects  for possible rationalization  and will continue its efforts to control costs 
these actions are expected to reduce capital employed and improve cash flow and earnings performance 

table of contents change in fiscal year end in august  universal s board of directors approved a change in universal s fiscal year end from june to march with the change  the fiscal year better matches the crop and operating cycles of the company s largest operations 
the change also allowed the company to eliminate a three month reporting lag previously used for most of its foreign subsidiaries 
fiscal years and each cover a twelve month period ended march fiscal year results cover the nine month transition year from july   through march  however  wherever practicable  the forthcoming discussion will compare the consolidated financial statements for fiscal year with the recast pro forma financial statements for the twelve months ended march  for purposes of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  the company believes that this comparison provides a more meaningful analysis 
net income for the foreign subsidiaries for the three month period ended march   representing the elimination of the reporting lag  is reflected as an addition to retained earnings in the consolidated statement of shareholders equity in the consolidated financial statements for the nine month transition year ended march  in addition  the net change in cash and cash equivalents for foreign subsidiaries for this three month period is reported as a separate line item in the consolidated statement of cash flows 
throughout this discussion  data for all periods except as of and for the twelve months ended march   are derived from the company s consolidated financial statements  which appear in this report 
summary financial information for the twelve months ended march   recast to show historical results without the reporting lag for foreign subsidiaries  is found in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  which also includes more information on the derivation of the recast financial information 
results of operations fiscal year ended march   compared to the fiscal year ended march  net income for the fiscal year ended march   was million  or 
per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share last year 
restructuring and impairment charges and lower operating income in each of the company s business segments negatively impacted results for the fiscal year 
the company recorded million million after taxes or per diluted share in restructuring and impairment charges related to the closure of its tobacco processing plant in danville  virginia  its overhead reduction program  and its investment in zimbabwe 
the company deconsolidated its operations in zimbabwe as of january   under us accounting requirements that apply under certain conditions to foreign subsidiaries that are subject to foreign exchange controls and other government restrictions 
after deconsolidation  the company recorded a non cash charge of million to adjust the investment in those operations to estimated fair value 
there was no tax benefit associated with this charge 
the investment is now accounted for using the cost method and is reported on the balance sheet in investments in unconsolidated affiliates 
business operations in zimbabwe were not impacted by the financial reporting change or the non cash charge  and the company intends to continue its operations there 
in fiscal year  universal closed its danville  virginia  processing plant and incurred a restructuring charge of million 
additional charges of million were related to other cost reduction initiatives 
revenues were billion for the year  compared to billion in the prior year 
tobacco segment results for the year were down by million  or about  compared to the prior year due primarily to poor results in south america and africa 
higher costs due to the relative strength of the brazilian currency and the poor quality of the crop  caused by adverse weather conditions  combined to reduce operating margins in south america 
in africa  results were impacted by incremental currency remeasurement and exchange losses totaling about million  expenses associated with the factory start up in mozambique of approximately million  higher overhead costs  and lower margins on burley tobacco sales due to pricing pressures associated with the overhang from the large malawi burley crop in in addition  the company s flue cured growing projects in malawi and zambia were negatively impacted by low crop yields caused by inadequate rainfall 
the zambian projects also suffered higher labor and operating costs generated by the substantial appreciation of the zambian currency 
however  african results were also impacted by increased volume from tanzania and from carryover shipments of the malawi crop from fiscal year tobacco segment results for fiscal year also included incremental provisions of about million for uncollectible farmer advances  in several african countries  brazil  and the philippines 
in addition  sales volumes of blended strips were lower for the year due to a sharp decline in demand for that product 

table of contents although overall tobacco segment operating income was down  results for the us operations were improved 
us operations benefited from operating efficiencies  higher sales volumes  and savings from the closing of the danville plant 
prior year results reflected a charge of million for european commission fines on subsidiaries of the company related to tobacco buying practices in spain  which reduced results for that period by 
per diluted share 
tobacco revenues increased for the year by about primarily because of carryover shipments of the malawi crop from fiscal year and an increase in prices for brazilian tobacco related to the stronger brazilian currency 
the company did not record a charge for the european commission fine of million about million related to green tobacco buying practices in italy  which was announced in october the company and its italian subsidiary  deltafina  were jointly assessed the fine after the european commission revoked deltafina s conditional immunity  which had been granted in based on consultation with outside counsel  management believes that the terms of the immunity agreement were not breached and that immunity will be restored through the appeal of the decision in the courts 
the company and deltafina each have appealed the decision to the court of first instance of the european communities 
lumber and building products operations rebounded late in the fiscal year as margins improved  but the annual results for this segment were million lower than last year 
the lower results for the year were due to ongoing price pressure from diy retailers negatively affecting margins in retail supply 
the decline in retail supply margins was partly offset by improved results in the construction supply market  which benefited from increased sales volume and higher margins due to good cost control for the year 
revenues in the lumber and building products segment increased by in fiscal year  primarily  because of acquisitions and improved conditions in construction supply markets 
agri product results were down million for the year due to losses from market price declines in both sunflower seeds and almonds 
these charges totaled million 
the charges in nuts were primarily due to a market price decline in almonds  created by an oversupply from the california crop 
us sunflower seed crop yields were substantially higher than the prior year  which generated a market oversupply and significant price declines 
these charges were partially offset by the favorable resolution of a lawsuit related to sunflower seeds during fiscal year excluding the losses from market price declines  agri products results for the year were much higher than last year due to improved market conditions in rubber  cashews  and seeds 
agri products revenues increased for the year due to higher synthetic rubber sales and increased volumes in dried fruits and nuts 
selling  general  and administrative expenses increased at a faster rate than revenues because currency losses and charges for uncollectible supplier advances are included in that line item 
lower incentive compensation accruals  lower executive benefit costs  and a currency gain on a foreign withholding tax refund generated a reduction in corporate costs of million 
interest expense was substantially higher for the year due to increased borrowing levels and higher short term interest rates 

table of contents the following table summarizes some of the major factors for fiscal year compared to fiscal year in millions  except per share amounts tobacco segment higher provisions for losses on farmer advances incremental african currency remeasurement and exchange losses mozambique factory start up costs european commission fines in the prior year net decrease in tobacco segment earnings agri products segment losses from market declines in almonds and sunflower seeds favorable resolution of lawsuit net decrease in agri products earnings other restructuring and impairment charges reduction in corporate overhead decrease in operating income increase in interest expense decrease in income before income taxes and other items decrease in net income decrease in diluted earnings per share the consolidated effective income tax rate for the current fiscal year was compared to for the prior year 
there was no tax benefit associated with the impairment charge to reduce the company s investment in zimbabwe  which significantly increased the effective income tax rate for the year 
in addition  the company s effective tax rate remains above the statutory us rate due to excess foreign taxes recorded in countries where the tax rate exceeds the us rate  and local tax expense recorded by a foreign subsidiary with a us dollar loss for the current fiscal year 
fiscal year ended march   compared to recast twelve months ended march  sales and other operating revenues operating income fiscal year ended march  twelve months ended march  fiscal year ended march  twelve months ended march  recast recast tobacco lumber and building products agri products total segments corporate expenses equity in pretax earnings of unconsolidated affiliates restructuring costs consolidated total net income for the fiscal year that ended on march   was million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share  for the twelve months ended march   which was recast for the effect of the year end change and elimination of the foreign reporting lag in fiscal year the results for fiscal year reflected a second quarter charge of million for announced eu fines on the company s subsidiaries due to their tobacco buying practices in spain 
as the fines are not tax deductible  the charge reduced net income for fiscal year by million  
table of contents or per diluted share 
results for the recast twelve months ended march   included million for the settlement of the deloach lawsuit in may  million in charges for rationalizing us operations  and million in charges for rejected tobacco 
those charges totaled million after taxes  or per diluted share 
revenues were billion for fiscal year compared to billion for the recast prior year 
recast amounts for the twelve months ended march   are presented in the table above and in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements  and the following discussion addresses recast figures for fiscal year unless otherwise noted 
tobacco segment results improved by about for fiscal year to million 
the results for fiscal year include a charge of million for the eu fines  and the prior year s recast results included the million deloach lawsuit settlement 
the positive comparisons caused by the prior year s million charge associated with customer rejected tobacco  coupled with higher tobacco shipments in fiscal year from africa and brazil and earlier shipments of current crop oriental tobaccos  were partially offset by the effects of the changing monetary system in zimbabwe and lower volumes from europe 
changes in the monetary system in zimbabwe in january created volatility in the company s results due to remeasurement of local currency earnings 
as a result  the company was unable to offset inflationary cost increases with interest on local deposits or gains on conversion of us dollars into local currency  despite net benefits of about million in fiscal year  and this negatively impacted fiscal year comparisons 
these currency and fiscal policy related items reduced fiscal year earnings by about million 
in addition  in fiscal year  the company recognized a million allowance for the estimated loss on realization of certain value added tax credits in brazil due to changes in local laws 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on tax changes 
that charge  however  was partially offset by net currency remeasurement gains of million and a million recovery of other value added taxes there 
the improvement in tobacco results during fiscal occurred in the fourth quarter as the majority of the shipments that had been delayed from earlier quarters were completed  and tobacco provided most of the increase in earnings for the quarter 
tobacco revenues increased by about million for the year because of increases from shipments of larger crops in brazil and higher shipments from africa  which were largely offset by lower volumes from europe 
results for the company s lumber and building products segment increased by million  or  in fiscal year results reflected the benefits of slightly increased volume in construction supply markets and cost control in both construction and retail supply markets  which remained extremely competitive 
in addition  about half of the earnings increase arose from a appreciation of the euro  results from small acquisitions  pension adjustments  and gains from sales of real estate along with the prior year s divestiture of a small belgian operation 
revenues for this segment increased by million  nearly half of which was due to the strength of the euro 
higher volumes in the tea and rubber businesses were largely responsible for the million improvement in the company s agri products segment 
however  results for nuts and dried fruits were impacted by adverse conditions in cashew markets where suppliers defaulted on some contracted deliveries 
results for seeds were affected by a claim of a sunflower seed grower 
nearly of the million increase in revenue in the segment for fiscal year arose from the acquisition of a controlling interest in a small company that trades nuts and dried fruits 
including this business  nuts and dried fruits represented about half of the growth in agri products revenues  however  results were limited by market conditions 
selling  general  and administrative expenses increased at a faster rate than revenues  in part because of additional costs of complying with the internal control requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act section  which increased external consulting and audit costs by about million during fiscal year in addition  higher legal fees were required to respond to the european union s actions regarding the company s european tobacco buying practices 
the million provision for value added tax credits in brazil was also included in this account  as was the million of brazilian vat refunds 
interest expense increased compared to the prior year primarily due to higher debt balances and  to a lesser extent  increasing interest rates 
the company s annual effective tax rate was approximately for fiscal year  primarily because of the non deductible eu fines 
before the effect of the eu fines  the tax rate was in line with the prior year 
the company s effective tax rate remains above the statutory us rate due to excess foreign taxes recorded in countries where the tax rate exceeds the us rate  and local tax expense recorded by a foreign subsidiary with a us dollar loss for fiscal year accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter statement no 

statement no 
amends accounting research bulletin no 
arb no 
to clarify that abnormal amounts of production related costs  such as idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted materials  should be recognized as current period charges rather than being recorded as inventory 
table of contents cost 
statement no 
also requires that allocation of fixed production overhead to inventory cost be based on the normal capacity of a company s production facilities 
statement no 
will be effective for universal in fiscal year the company does not expect the impact of statement no 
to be material to its financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued a revision of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 titled share based payment statement no 
r 
statement no 
r requires that share based payments  such as grants of stock options  restricted shares  and stock appreciation rights  be measured at fair value and reported as expense in a company s financial statements over the requisite service period 
the earlier guidance that statement no 
r replaced allowed companies the alternative of recognizing expense for share based payments in their financial statements or disclosing the pro forma effect of those payments in the notes to the financial statements 
universal periodically issues share based payments to employees under its compensation programs and has elected to make pro forma disclosures under the current accounting guidance 
the company is required to adopt statement no 
r as of april   which is the beginning of fiscal year  and will recognize expense over the service period for the fair value of all grants issued after march   as well as expense attributable to the remaining service period for all prior grants that have not fully vested by that date 
since vesting of share based payments is normally accelerated at the date a grantee retires  the requisite service period under statement no 
r does not extend beyond the earliest date the grantee is eligible to retire 
as a result  after the statement is adopted  the fair value of the grants will be recognized as expense over the shorter of the stated vesting period or the period to the date of retirement eligibility 
this will result in immediate recognition of the fair value of grants to any employees who are already eligible for retirement and create less uniformity in expense from period to period 
the company currently attributes service for expense recognition over the shorter of the required service period or the period to the employee s mandatory retirement date  with recognition being accelerated if an employee elects to retire early 
at the anticipated level of future share based grants  the company does not expect the effect on annual net income from the adoption of statement no 
r to be materially different from the stock based compensation cost under the fair value method for fiscal year reported in the disclosures in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources overview universal s liquidity and capital resource requirements are predominantly short term in nature and primarily relate to working capital required for tobacco crop purchases 
working capital needs are seasonal within each geographic region 
the geographic dispersion and the timing of working capital needs permit universal to predict its general level of cash requirements 
the marketing of the crop in each geographic area is heavily influenced by weather conditions and follows the cycle of buying  processing  and shipping of the tobacco crop 
the timing of individual customer shipping requirements may change the level or the duration of crop financing 
despite a predominance of short term needs  the company maintains a relatively large portion of its total debt as long term to reduce liquidity risk 
during the year  universal reduced the level of investment in working capital and capital spending to improve cash flow and also issued preferred stock to improve its balance sheet structure 
working capital working capital at march   was million  up million from march   primarily due to a decrease in current liabilities 
universal reduced notes payable and overdrafts with million in proceeds of convertible preferred stock issued in march earlier  the company had repaid million in maturing long term debt  which increased notes payable and overdrafts 
working capital also increased because of somewhat higher needs in brazil due to crop timing and currency changes 
as of march   brazilian farmers had delivered a higher portion of the tobacco crops to be sold in the next fiscal year than they had delivered in the previous fiscal year  and the local brazilian currency had strengthened against the us dollar by 
at march   tobacco inventories in brazil were up million  partially offset by a million decline in advances to suppliers  which primarily reflected a reduction of brazilian farmer advances 
increases in customer advances and deposits reduced working capital by million 
the level of customer advances can vary from year to year as customers review their circumstances 
accordingly  the company considers such advances as borrowings when it reviews its balance sheet structure 
africa also experienced a more normal shipping schedule in fiscal year  which was the primary factor in the million decrease in accounts receivable 
the company s uncommitted tobacco inventories increased to approximately million  or about of tobacco inventory  compared to million at march   which represented of tobacco inventory 
higher prices in brazil along with purchases from the burley growers stabilization cooperative at the end of the us farm program in the united states increased the level of uncommitted stocks held by the company 
management does not consider these levels excessive 

table of contents capital spending the company s capital expenditures are generally limited to those that add value for the customer  replace or maintain equipment  increase efficiency  or position the company for future growth 
universal s capital expenditures were approximately million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year  and million in the nine months ended march   before considering the capital expenditures totaling million by foreign subsidiaries in the three months ended march  the latter capital expenditures do not appear on the face of the cash flow statement due to a reporting lag that was eliminated when the company changed its year end reporting date 
in fiscal years and  a significant portion of the capital spending was related to the construction of a new factory in mozambique  which cost about million 
that factory was completed in fiscal year and started operations in late summer approximately million of the capital expenditures in the nine months ended march   related to the completion of a major investment in leaf processing in the united states 
the company plans to reduce capital spending to a level below depreciation 
management does not foresee that major investments in tobacco processing facilities will be necessary in the near term 
outstanding debt and other financing arrangements universal s total debt decreased by about million during fiscal year  and its total debt as a percentage of total capitalization including total debt  deferred taxes  minority interests  and shareholders equity decreased to approximately from at march   and at march  the decrease in the percentage reflects the company s issuance of series b convertible perpetual preferred stock the preferred stock  which increased shareholders equity by million 
proceeds from the preferred stock offering were used to repay million of debt outstanding under the company s revolving credit facility and million of other short term notes payable 
the annual dividend on each share of preferred stock will be per annum of the liquidation preference and will be payable quarterly  when  as and if declared by the company s board of directors 
dividends on the preferred stock are not cumulative  and the company may not declare or pay dividends on its common stock unless dividends on the preferred stock for the four most recent consecutive dividend periods have been declared and paid 
the preferred stock contains provisions that prohibit the payment of cash dividends in some cases 
each share of preferred stock will be convertible at any time at the option of the holder at a conversion rate which is currently approximately shares of universal common stock 
the conversion rate is subject to customary adjustments in certain circumstances 
subsequent to the balance sheet date  additional shares were issued under a day option held by the underwriters 
that issuance increased shareholders equity by an additional million 
the proceeds were used to repay short term notes payable 
total long term obligations  including current maturities  decreased by million to million while notes payable increased by million to million 
the company classified million of borrowings supported by its revolving credit facility as long term debt on its march   balance sheet because of the issuance  subsequent to fiscal year end  of a million three year note in a private placement transaction to refinance those borrowings 
the note  which was issued in fiscal year  bears interest at libor plus and is callable by the company  beginning in may in december  the company filed a new  undenominated shelf registration with the securities and exchange commission 
the company expects to use the proceeds from any sales of securities issued under this shelf registration for general corporate purposes  which may include the repayment of indebtedness  capital expenditures  acquisitions  and funding of working capital needs 
bank facilities as of march   universal had approximately billion in uncommitted lines of credit  of which approximately million were unused and available to support seasonal working capital needs 
the company also has a five year committed revolving credit facility totaling million 
the facility will mature on january  as of march   the company had million outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
the company provides for short term needs through bilateral bank lines and its revolving credit facility 
under the terms of its bank agreements  the company must maintain certain levels of tangible net worth and observe restrictions on debt levels 
the company was in compliance with all such covenants at march  in february  the company determined that the restructuring and impairment charges for the closure of the danville  virginia facility  combined with lower than expected operating results for the quarter ended december   and a decrease in committed tobacco inventories caused by shipments during that quarter  caused a covenant breach under its revolving credit agreement and two secured term loans 
waivers of the covenant violation were received from a sufficient number of the banks participating in the revolving credit facility  and no event of default occurred under the agreement 
the company decided to repay million outstanding under the secured term loans on february   to avoid additional costs to amend the term loans and to release the liens from the danville  virginia  facility  which had been pledged as security on one of the loans 
no covenants were breached in any of the company s other debt obligations 
the company 
table of contents completed an amendment of its revolving credit facility on march  the amendment revised the definition of consolidated ebitda  which in part allows the company to exclude certain restructuring and impairment charges from the calculations related to the covenant on maximum consolidated average total indebtedness 
the maximum ratio allowed under this financial covenant was also increased 
the company must also maintain a higher level of consolidated tangible net worth 
all other material terms of the revolving credit facility remained unchanged 
credit ratings in march  moody s investors service moody s downgraded the company s long term credit ratings from baa to ba and short term credit ratings from p to nr 
the ratings remained under review for possible downgrade 
standard poor s reduced the company s long term credit rating from bbb to bbb with a negative outlook in february the rating downgrades have increased the company s borrowing costs 
management communicates regularly with the rating agencies 
since the company s credit ratings were lowered below investment grade by moody s  the company has experienced increased short term interest costs and more restricted access to capital markets  as it left the commercial paper markets 
however  the increase in short term borrowing costs since march   is related to the basis point increase in market rates for us dollar borrowings of days or less 
universal has mitigated the rate increase where possible by substituting lower cost bank lines 
derivatives from time to time  the company uses interest rate swap agreements to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates 
these agreements typically adjust interest rates on designated long term obligations from fixed to variable 
the swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges 
at march   the company had outstanding interest rate swap agreements on million notional amount of long term debt 
these agreements effectively adjust interest rates from fixed to floating and are accounted for as fair value hedges 
near the end of fiscal year  universal entered a foreign currency swap with a third party to mitigate its exposure to changes in exchange rates related to a foreign currency denominated receivable from a subsidiary 
the swap converts a fixed rate  foreign currency denominated receivable to a fixed rate receivable denominated in us dollars 
it is accounted for as a cash flow hedge  and its notional amount was approximately million euros million at march  pension funding funds supporting the company s erisa regulated domestic defined benefit pension plans increased by million to million because of positive performance of the investment portfolio during the year ended december   the measurement date for the plan 
as of april   the market value of the fund was about million  compared to the accumulated benefit obligation abo of million and the projected benefit obligation pbo of million 
the abo and pbo are calculated on the basis of certain assumptions that are outlined in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company plans to contribute approximately million to the domestic pension fund during the next year  which is more than the contribution required by erisa 
it is the company s policy to monitor the performance of the funds and to review the adequacy of its funding and its contributions to those funds 
the fund is managed for long term returns  and in may  the company elected to change its asset allocation slightly as a result of a study of the plan s liabilities and the returns required to meet them 
as of march   the target fund allocation is as follows to domestic equity securities  to international equity securities  and to fixed income securities 
cash flow the company recorded several charges during fiscal year  most of which were non cash 
of the million in restructuring and impairment charges  about million represented non cash charges 
in addition  approximately million of the provisions related to farmer advances and losses related to agri product market price declines were non cash 
thus  despite the reduction in net income of nearly million for the year  net cash provided by operating activities increased by about million  primarily because of a lower investment in working capital 
net cash used in investing activities was about million lower than in fiscal year the reduction was caused by the decrease in capital spending as well as the sale of corporate owned life insurance policies of approximately million during the year 
net cash provided by financing activities was about million  which represented a decline of about million from fiscal year  because substantially more of the company s cash requirements in fiscal year were provided by operating cash flow 

table of contents contractual obligations the company s contractual obligations as of march   were as follows in millions of dollars total thereafter notes payable and long term debt operating lease obligations inventory purchase obligations tobacco lumber agri products agricultural materials capital expenditure obligations other purchase obligations total includes interest payments 
interest payments on million of variable rate debt are estimated on the basis of march  rates 
in addition to principal and interest payments on notes payable and long term debt  the company s contractual obligations include operating lease payments  inventory purchase commitments  and capital expenditure commitments 
operating lease obligations represent minimum payments due under leases for various production  storage  distribution  and other facilities  as well as vehicles and equipment 
tobacco inventory purchase obligations primarily represent contracts to purchase tobacco from farmers 
the amounts shown above are estimates since actual quantities purchased will depend on crop yield and prices will depend on the quality of the tobacco delivered 
more than half of the company s crop year contracts to purchase tobacco are with farmers in brazil 
tobacco purchase obligations have been partially funded by advances to farmers  which totaled approximately million as of march  commitments to purchase agri products inventories are frequently matched to forward sales contracts with customers 
management believes that its financial resources are adequate to support its capital needs 
those resources include cash from operations  cash balances  the potential to issue debt to the public under its shelf registration statement  and committed and uncommitted bank lines 
any excess cash flow from operations after dividends  capital expenditures  and any necessary debt reduction will be available to fund expansion  purchase the company s stock  or otherwise enhance shareholder value 
critical accounting estimates and assumptions in preparing the financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that have an impact on the assets  liabilities  revenue  and expense amounts reported 
these estimates can also affect supplemental information disclosures of the company  including information about contingencies  risk  and financial condition 
the company believes  given current facts and circumstances  its estimates and assumptions are reasonable  adhere to gaap  and are consistently applied 
however  changes in the assumptions used could result in a material adjustment to the financial statements 
the company s most critical accounting estimates and assumptions are in the following areas inventories inventories of tobacco and most agri products are valued at the lower of cost or market with cost determined under the specific cost method 
in the tobacco and agri product businesses  raw materials are clearly identified at the time of purchase 
the company tracks the costs associated with raw materials in the final product lots  and maintains this identification through the time of sale 
the company also capitalizes direct and indirect costs related to processing raw materials 
this method of cost accounting is referred to as the specific cost or specific identification method 
lumber and building products inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined under the first in  first out method 
the company writes down inventory for changes in market value based upon assumptions related to future demand and market conditions 
future demand assumptions can be impacted by changes in customer sales  changes in customers inventory positions and policies  competitors pricing policies and inventory positions  changing customer needs  and varying crop sizes and qualities 
market conditions that differ significantly from those assumed by management could result in additional write downs 
the company experiences inventory write downs routinely 
inventory write downs in fiscal years and  and the transition year ended march   were million  million  and million  respectively 

table of contents advances to suppliers and guarantees of bank loans to suppliers the company provides agronomy services and seasonal crop advances of  or for  seed  fertilizer  and other supplies in its tobacco segment 
these advances are short term in nature and are customarily repaid upon delivery of tobacco to the company 
primarily in brazil and certain african countries  the company has also made long term advances to tobacco farmers to finance curing barns and other farm infrastructure 
in brazil  the company also guarantees both short term and long term loans made to farmers for the same purposes 
in some years  due to low crop yields and other factors  individual farmers may not deliver sufficient volumes of tobacco to repay maturing advances 
in that case  the company may extend repayment of the advances into the following crop year or satisfy the guarantee by acquiring the loan from the bank 
in either situation  the company will incur losses whenever it is unable to recover the full amount of the loans and advances 
at each reporting period  management must make estimates and assumptions in determining the valuation allowance for advances to farmers and the liability to accrue for its obligations under bank loan guarantees 
intangible assets the company reviews the carrying value of goodwill as necessary  and at least annually  utilizing a discounted cash flow model 
the preparation of discounted future operating cash flow analyses requires significant management judgment with respect to operating earnings growth rates and the selection of an appropriate discount rate 
the majority of the company s goodwill is from acquisitions in the tobacco segment 
neither a one percentage point increase in the discount rate assumption nor a one percentage point decline in the cash flow growth rate assumption would result in an impairment charge 
however  significant changes in estimates of future cash flows  such as those caused by unforeseen events or changes in market conditions  could result in an impairment charge 
income taxes the company s effective tax rate is based on its expected income  statutory tax rates  and tax planning opportunities in the various jurisdictions in which the company operates 
significant judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate and evaluating the tax position of the company 
the effective tax rate is applied to quarterly operating results 
the company  through its subsidiaries  is subject to the tax laws of many jurisdictions  and could be subject to a tax audit in each of these jurisdictions  which could result in adjustments to tax expense in future periods 
in the event that there is a significant  unusual  or one time item recognized in the company s results  the tax attributed to that item would be recorded at the same time as the item 
for example  in fiscal year  the company recorded a charge for certain fines imposed by the european commission that will not be deductible for income tax purposes in the related countries where assessed 
no tax benefit was recognized on this charge  which increased the consolidated tax rate 
in fiscal year  a similar situation arose when the company recognized an impairment charge on its investment in zimbabwe  which did not provide a deduction for income tax purposes 
tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements 
as a result  the company s effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in its tax returns 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses that are not tax deductible  while others are related to timing issues  such as differences in depreciation methods 
timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in future tax returns for which the company has already recorded the tax benefit in its financial statements 
the company has recorded valuation allowances for deferred tax assets when the amount of estimated future taxable income was not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit 
during the nine months ended march   the company received a significant dividend from a foreign subsidiary that enabled the company to utilize foreign tax credit carryforwards of approximately million 
the company expects foreign tax credit carryforwards to be generated in future periods 
any significant reduction in future taxable income and changes in its sources or changes in us or foreign tax laws could result in the expiration of foreign tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the company s financial statements for which payment has been deferred or an expense that has not yet been recognized in the financial statements and has been deducted in the company s tax return

table of contents pension plans and postretirement benefits the measurement of the company s pension and postretirement obligations and costs are dependent on a variety of assumptions used by the company s actuaries 
these assumptions include estimating the present value of projected future pension payments to all plan participants  taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as salary increases and demographic experience 
the assumptions made by the company may have an effect on the amount and timing of future contributions 
the plan trustee conducts an independent valuation of the fair value of pension plan assets 
the significant assumptions used in the calculation of pension and postretirement obligations are discount rate the discount rate is based on investment yields available at the measurement date on corporate long term bonds rated aa 
salary growth the salary growth assumption is a factor of the company s long term actual experience  the near term outlook  and assumed inflation 
expected return on plan assets the expected return reflects asset allocations and investment strategy 
retirement and mortality rates retirement rates are based on actual plan experience along with the company s near term outlook 
early retirement assumptions are based on actual company experience 
mortality rates are based on standard group annuity rp mortality tables 
health care cost trends for postretirement medical plan obligations and costs  the company makes assumptions on future increases in medical costs 
these assumptions are based on the actual experience of the company along with third party forecasts of long term medical cost trends 
the effect of actual results differing from the company s assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect its recognized expense in such future periods 
sensitivity analysis 
the effect of the indicated decrease or increase in the selected assumptions is shown below  assuming no change in benefit levels in thousands of dollars effect on projected benefit obligation increase decrease effect on annual expense increase decrease change in assumption pension plans increase in discount rate decrease in discount rate increase in salary scale decrease in salary scale increase in rate of return on assets n a  decrease in rate of return on assets n a  change in assumption other postretirement benefits increase in discount rate decrease in discount rate increase in medical inflation decrease in medical inflation see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on pension and postretirement benefit plans 
other estimates and assumptions other management estimates and assumptions are routinely required in preparing the company s financial statements  including the determination of valuation allowances on accounts receivable  value added tax credits in brazil  and the determination of the fair value of the investment in zimbabwe operations 
changes in market and economic conditions  local tax laws  and other related factors are considered each reporting period  and adjustments to the accounts are made based on management s best judgment 

table of contents other information regarding trends and management s actions the company s financial performance depends on its ability to maintain efficient operations and to secure the tobacco volumes desired by its customers 
after an increase in worldwide flue cured production by exporting countries excluding china in fiscal year  fiscal year saw a modest decline of about to billion kilos 
flue cured production is forecast to decline by another in fiscal year despite an increase in production in the united states as production in brazil and zimbabwe is reduced 
although it is slightly smaller  brazil s flue cured crop appears to be of average quality after two years of lower quality crops due to weather conditions 
despite the decline in volume that is forecast in fiscal year  the world flue cured tobacco market is expected to remain in oversupply with uncommitted inventories increasing 
in fiscal year  the company will continue its evaluation of the viability of its african flue cured growing projects 
burley crops in exporting countries excluding china increased by in fiscal year  but declined by in fiscal year  bringing the two year increase to about 
production is forecast to remain at about million kilos in fiscal year  and uncommitted inventories of burley tobaccos are expected to increase 
however  recently farmers in malawi have protested auction pricing levels 
any disruption in the marketing of the crop in malawi would have a significant impact on world supply of burley tobacco and on the financial results for the company 
economic conditions in europe that affect the company s lumber operations remain difficult  but the construction supply market has experienced a rebound in recent months 
in agri products  management has taken steps to avoid the situations that caused the large inventory write downs in fiscal year the company expects that near term demand for leaf tobacco will be flat or declining slightly primarily due to the flattening trend in world cigarette consumption and improved leaf utilization by cigarette manufacturers 
the improvements in leaf utilization by manufacturers along with a possible shift to smokeless products may mean that demand for leaf tobacco has peaked and will not grow with any growth in consumption 
on a year to year basis  the company is susceptible to fluctuations in leaf supply due to crop size and leaf demand as manufacturers adjust inventories or respond to changes in the cigarette market 
the company estimates that industry worldwide uncommitted flue cured and burley inventories totaled about million kilos  excluding inventories of asian government owned monopolies  at march   compared to million kilos at march  at march   about million kilos represented us tobaccos held by the commodity credit corporation for sale to the industry or by the us farmers stabilization cooperatives 
that tobacco was sold during the year and is the primary reason for the decline in uncommitted inventories since march with the large crops continuing in fiscal year  it is likely that industry inventories of uncommitted stocks will increase in the coming year 
although cigar consumption continues to grow in the united states  consumption within the main european union markets has remained flat 
supplies of filler and binder tobaccos  which until last year had been in surplus due to overproduction in certain countries  are generally in balance with demand 
the market for cigar wrapper continues to be firm 
within the smokeless segment of the dark tobacco business  consumption of loose leaf chewing tobacco continues to decline by between and annually  while the consumption of moist snuff products has been growing at about per year 
management believes that there is an adequate supply of suitable dark tobacco in the world market to meet the demand of the manufacturers of smokeless tobacco products 
the high price of us leaf relative to the world market has limited exports  which  combined with declining purchases by us manufacturers  have led to a decline in the amount of tobacco produced in the united states 
that decline led to excess processing capacity in the united states  and the company announced in december that it had closed its danville  virginia factory and consolidated all us flue cured and burley processing into its nash county  north carolina facility 
because the shortfall from the decline in zimbabwe tobacco purchased at auction has been replaced with crops from areas where the company contracts with and provides financing to farmers  the company faces increased financing and inventory risk 
efforts to expand sources of african tobacco have required investments in working capital and operating facilities 
should tobacco production fail to fully develop in areas where the company is making these investments  tobacco volumes and prices may not be sufficient for the company to operate at a satisfactory return in those areas 
the company continues to evaluate the viability of those projects 

table of contents the company s debt levels increased over the last several fiscal years as a result of its investment in expansion of tobacco sources and factories  expansion of its agri products and lumber and building products businesses  and the weak us dollar 
in march  moody s investor service reduced the ratings on universal s senior long term debt from baa to ba and short term credit ratings from p to nr 
the ratings remain under review for possible further downgrade 
standard poor s reduced the company s long term credit ratings from bbb to bbb with a negative outlook in february the company issued million of convertible perpetual preferred stock in march to provide additional liquidity and to strengthen its balance sheet  and net cash provided by operations improved by about million in fiscal year on a much lower investment in working capital 
management expects the trend of increasing debt to continue to reverse as investments in its businesses are completed and crop sizes in brazil and africa decrease 
however  the weakness of the us dollar may continue to adversely affect debt balances 
the european union eu has taken action toward modifying the system of granting subsidies to tobacco farmers 
the eu subsidy makes up well over half of the revenue that a european farmer receives on a tobacco crop 
beginning with the crop  which will affect universal in fiscal year  and through the crop  of the subsidy has been decoupled from production 
the decoupling essentially means that a farmer can receive the subsidy granted even if the farmer does not plant tobacco  so long as he keeps the land associated with that subsidy in good agricultural and environmental conditions 
the remaining portion of the subsidy shall remain subject to actual production of tobacco 
this means  in practical terms  that the total aid to tobacco farmers remains unchanged for those who continue  however  the incentive to grow tobacco does change and some growers could decide to discontinue production 
in the subsidy system applicable to the interim period crops the eu tobacco budget allocated to each producing country for payment of the coupled portion shall remain unchanged  even if total production drops within certain limits 
the farmers who continue to produce tobacco in countries where tobacco production declines during the interim period will receive a larger portion of the coupled subsidy than they would have if the eu budget had not been fixed for the interim period 
individual member states can increase the decoupled portion of the subsidy up to 
three of the main tobacco producing countries where the company operates  directly or indirectly  italy  spain and france  have decided not to decouple more than the minimum of the subsidy 
the crop contracts between farmers and processors indicate a reduction of total tobacco production of between and  mostly in the less desirable varieties and production areas 
because of the fixed budget allocated to tobacco coupled subsidy  this reduction shall result in an increase of the per unit subsidy available to those farmers who have decided to continue producing tobacco 
in greece  where the company s joint venture  socotab llc  has oriental tobacco operations  the government opted to decouple of the subsidy from the growing of tobacco 
the company expects some reduction in crop volumes as a result of the decoupling  but it is too early to determine the impact on the operations of the joint venture 
the company has operations in two countries  poland and hungary  who joined the eu on may  in those countries  the new subsidy system will not be implemented before the crop  and in the meantime  tobacco farmers will receive subsidies mainly financed by the domestic budget 
during fiscal year  customers located in hungary significantly reduced their purchases of hungarian leaf  and the hungarian government introduced new  more restrictive rules for the distribution of domestically financed subsidies  that were less favorable to the continuation of tobacco production 
both negative factors have been corrected in recent months 
unless the subsidy system in place for the four crop years through is extended to  the decoupled portion would increase to  while the remaining would be used to finance restructuring activities in the tobacco regions 
the decline in production will accelerate after the expiration of the interim period with the crop  unless action is taken to extend the system through year or alternative funds are made available at the national level 
management believes that in the interim period  the major influence on the farmers decisions to produce tobacco will be the level of commercial prices for green tobaccos 
higher farm income will depend on leaf quality and on cost reduction 
in addition  confirmed support from european tobacco product manufacturers will be crucial to the long term viability of tobacco production in europe 
management believes that if farmer prices do not increase or  alternatively  if the member states do not choose to implement subsidies for tobacco production  the volume of tobacco produced in europe will decline over time 
in this case  the company s results of operations could be negatively affected 
the recorded value of the company s equity in net fixed assets that could be affected by these changes was approximately million at march  in addition  unrealized currency losses for tobacco operations there were million  net of taxes  million of which relates to hungary 
an important trend in the tobacco industry has been consolidation among manufacturers of tobacco products 
this trend is expected to continue  particularly as further privatization of state monopolies occurs  providing opportunities for acquisitions by international manufacturers 
this concentration could provide additional opportunities for international leaf merchants  including universal 
a key success factor for leaf dealers is the ability to provide customers with the quality of 
table of contents leaf and the level of service they desire at the lowest cost possible 
in addition  the international leaf dealers have larger historical market shares with some customers than with others 
consequently  the company s potential growth will be affected by the growth of its major customers  and consolidation of customers may have at least a short term favorable or unfavorable impact on the company s business 
additional attention by manufacturers to certain quality considerations and to social responsibility programs has increased universal s costs 
for example  the company has established worldwide farm programs to ensure that non tobacco related materials are kept out of the green tobacco delivered to the factories  which is an ongoing cost 
in addition  universal has established programs for good agricultural practices and has been active in social responsibility endeavors in many of the third world countries in which it does business 
world markets for all of the products that the company handles are extremely competitive 
management is continuing to focus on cost reductions and efficiency improvements 
in fiscal year  management completed a program that will eliminate million in tobacco and corporate overhead costs  some of which occurred in fiscal year decreased social acceptance of smoking and increased pressure from anti smoking groups have had an ongoing adverse effect on sales of tobacco products  particularly in the united states 
also a number of foreign governments have taken or proposed steps to restrict or prohibit cigarette advertising and promotion  to increase taxes on cigarettes  to prohibit smoking in public areas  and to discourage cigarette consumption 
a number of such measures are included in the framework convention on tobacco control  which was negotiated under the auspices of the world health organization 
in some cases  such restrictions are more onerous than those proposed or in effect in the united states 
the company cannot predict the extent to which government efforts to reduce tobacco consumption might affect the business of its primary customers 
however  a significant decrease in worldwide tobacco consumption brought about by existing or future governmental laws and regulations would reduce demand for the company s products and services and could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations 
recent indicators show that the dutch economy may have begun to improve 
according to the dutch statistics bureau and eurostat  unemployment rates have begun to fall  retail sales have risen  and business confidence is higher 
the dutch economy expanded by almost in the first calendar quarter of the company s construction supply business has improved 
continuing economic growth could provide an opportunity for volume and margin expansion 
conversely  a return to economic recession in the netherlands would negatively affect sales volumes and margins 
any weakness of the us dollar in relation to the euro benefits the company s lumber and building products operations  for which the euro is the functional currency 
in march  the company announced that as part of its strategy for enhancing shareholder value  it routinely evaluates alternatives  including acquisitions  divestitures  and strategic alliances  in each of its business units 
universal is in discussions regarding an offer for a substantial portion of its non tobacco business 
however  there can be no assurance that these discussions will result in a transaction 
the company  through its subsidiaries  is subject to the tax laws of many jurisdictions  and from time to time contests assessments of taxes due 
changes in tax laws or the interpretation of tax laws can affect the company s earnings  as can the resolution of various pending and contested tax issues 
the consolidated income tax rate is also affected by a number of factors  including  but not limited to  the mix of domestic and foreign earnings and investments  local tax rates of subsidiaries  repatriation of foreign earnings  and the company s ability to utilize foreign tax credits 
in recent years  the company s domestic income has declined while foreign income has increased 
if this trend continues and tax rates remain constant worldwide  the company s ability to utilize its foreign tax credits could be diminished 
as a result  its consolidated income tax rate could increase 
the company expects foreign tax credit carryforwards to be generated in future periods 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates after inventory is purchased  interest rate risk is limited in the tobacco business because customers usually pre finance purchases or pay market rates of interest for inventory purchased for their accounts 
the company s tobacco customers pay interest on tobacco purchased for their order 
that interest is paid at rates based on current markets for variable rate debt 
if universal were to fund its committed tobacco inventory with fixed rate debt  the company might not be able to recover interest at that fixed rate if current market interest rates were to fall 
as of 
table of contents march   tobacco inventory of million included million in inventory that was committed for sale to customers and million that was not committed 
committed inventory  after deducting about million in customer deposits  represents the company s net exposure of about million 
universal maintains a substantial portion of its debt at variable interest rates in order to substantially mitigate interest rate risk related to carrying fixed rate debt 
debt carried at variable interest rates was million at march  although a hypothetical change in short term interest rates would result in a change in annual interest expense of approximately million  approximately of that amount could be offset with changes in charges to customers 
the company s policy is to work toward a ratio of floating rate liabilities to fixed rate liabilities that  over time  is reflective of the relationship between current and non current assets 
committed inventory is part of this relationship 
currency the international tobacco trade generally is conducted in us dollars  thereby limiting foreign exchange risk to that which is related to production costs  overhead  and income taxes in the source country 
the company also provides farmer advances that are denominated in the local currency 
any currency gains or losses on those advances are usually offset by decreases or increases in the cost of tobacco  which is priced in the local currency 
however  the timing of the effect of the offset may not occur until a subsequent quarter or fiscal year 
most of the tobacco operations are accounted for using the us dollar as the functional currency 
because there are no forward foreign exchange markets in many of universal s major countries of tobacco origin  the company manages its foreign exchange risk by matching funding for inventory purchases with the currency of sale  which is usually the us dollar  and by minimizing its net investment in individual countries 
in these countries  the company is vulnerable to currency gains and losses to the extent that monetary assets and liabilities denominated in local currency do not offset each other 
the company recognized a million net exchange loss due to remeasurement for fiscal year  compared to a million net exchange loss due to remeasurement for fiscal year  and a thousand net remeasurement loss for the nine month transition year ended march  the company recognized million in net exchange losses from foreign currency transactions in fiscal year  compared to thousand in net exchange gains for the fiscal year ended march   and net exchange gains of million for the transition year ended march  in addition to foreign exchange gains and losses  the company is exposed to changes in the cost of tobacco due to changes in the value of the local currency in relation to the us dollar 
for example  when universal purchased the brazilian crop in the beginning of fiscal year  the local currency had appreciated significantly against the us dollar 
thus  the cost of the crop increased over that of the prior year  in us dollar terms 
the lumber and building products operations  which are based in the netherlands  use the euro as their functional currency 
in certain tobacco markets that are primarily domestic  the company uses the local currency as the functional currency 
examples of these domestic markets are hungary and poland 
in each case  reported earnings are affected by the translation of the local currency into the us dollar 
commodity the company works to limit its exposure to changes in prices in its agri products businesses by matching its customer orders with its supply contracts 
however  if the company is not able to match its position  then the business is subject to price changes 
the movement of pricing for certain products that the company purchases can be large 
universal uses commodity futures in its rubber trading business to reduce the risk of price fluctuations 
the company does not enter into rubber contracts for trading purposes 
all forward commodity contracts are adjusted to fair market value during the year  and gains and losses are recorded in income at that time 
the amounts recorded during fiscal years   and were not material 
derivatives policies hedging interest rate exposure using swaps and hedging foreign exchange exposure using forward contracts are specifically contemplated to manage risk in keeping with management s policies 
universal may use derivative instruments  such as swaps  forwards  or futures  which are based directly or indirectly upon interest rates  currencies  and commodities  to manage and reduce the risks inherent in interest rate  currency  and price fluctuations 
the company does not utilize derivatives for speculative purposes  and it does not enter into market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
derivatives are transaction specific so that a specific debt instrument  contract  or invoice determines the amount  maturity  and other specifics of the hedge 
counterparty risk is limited to institutions with long term debt ratings of a or better
