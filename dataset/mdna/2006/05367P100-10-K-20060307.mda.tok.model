item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview our markets and strategy our mission is to serve the industries that make  manage and move media 
we develop  market  sell and support a wide range of software and hardware for digital media production  management and distribution 
digital media are video  audio or graphic elements in which the image  sound or picture is recorded and stored in digital values  as opposed to analog  or tape based  signals 
the four key elements of our strategy are o deliver best of breed stand alone products to content creators  o deliver integrated workflow for customers who work with multiple systems or multiple media disciplines  o support open standards for media  metadata and application program interfaces api  and o deliver excellent customer service  support and training 
in order to effectively deliver our products and services to our target markets  we have organized our business in three reporting segments professional film  video and broadcast  which we refer to as professional video  audio  and consumer video 
our professional video products enable professionals and aspiring professionals  in the post production and broadcast markets to manipulate moving pictures and sound in fast  easy  creative and cost effective ways 
our audio product offerings include consumer and professional digital audio software applications and hardware systems for music  film  television  video  broadcast  live venues  streaming media and web development 
our consumer video segment offers products for home video editing and tv viewing 
over the past few years we have focused on expanding and enhancing our product lines and increasing revenues through both the internal development of products and acquisitions 
in august  we acquired california based pinnacle systems  a supplier of digital video products to customers ranging from individuals to broadcasters 
the acquisition of pinnacle has allowed us to expand our offerings within our professional video segment through the integration of pinnacle s broadcast and professional offerings  including the deko r on air graphics system and the mediastream tm playout server  into that segment and has provided entry into a new consumer video segment that will offer pinnacle s consumer products  including pinnacle studio tm and other products 
in august  we also acquired wizoo sound design gmbh  a germany based provider of virtual instruments for music producers and sound designers 
wizoo s products have been and will continue to be sold through our audio segment and wizoo technology is also being integrated into other avid audio product offerings to expand their features and functionality 
in  we finalized acquisitions for munich  germany based nxn software gmbh nxn  a leading provider of asset and production management systems specifically targeted for the entertainment and computer graphics industries  california based midiman  inc d b a m audio  a leading provider of digital audio and midi solutions for electronic musicians and audio professionals  and avid nordic ab  a sweden based distributor of avid products 
nxn has been integrated into our professional video segment and expanded our offerings in digital asset management by enabling our film and video post production  broadcast  audio and d animation customers to leverage the workflow capabilities of nxn s alienbrain r product line 
m audio has been integrated into our audio segment and its line of audio products are marketed alongside digidesign s digital audio workstations for the professional and home hobbyist 
the acquisition of avid nordic ab provided us with ownership of an established distribution channel in the nordic and benelux regions of europe 
financial summary total net revenues for were million  an increase of million  or  compared to a large proportion of this revenue growth is the direct result of our acquisitions  with the acquisition of pinnacle accounting for million of our revenue growth for and the acquisition of m audio  acquired in august  accounting for million 
net income for was million  a decrease of million  or  from however  our net income for was reduced by in process research and development charges of million primarily related to our acquisition of pinnacle 
our operating activities continue to generate positive cash flow with cash of million provided by operating activities in the following table sets forth certain items from our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated for the year ended december  product revenues services revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development marketing and selling general and administrative in process research and development restructuring and other costs  net amortization of intangible assets impairment of intangible assets total operating expenses operating income interest and other income expense  net income before income taxes provision for benefit from income taxes net income we derive a significant percentage of our revenue from international sales ie  sales to customers outside the united states 
international sales accounted for of our net revenues  compared to for and for our international business is  for the most part  transacted through international subsidiaries and generally in the currency of the end user customers 
therefore  we are exposed to the risk that changes in foreign currency could materially impact  either positively or adversely  our revenues  net income and cash flow 
to hedge against the foreign exchange exposure of certain forecasted receivables  payables and cash balances of our foreign subsidiaries  we enter into short term foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
we record gains and losses associated with currency rate changes on these contracts in results of operations  offsetting transaction and remeasurement gains and losses on the related assets and liabilities 
the success of this hedging program depends on forecasts of transaction activity in the various currencies 
to the extent that these forecasts are overstated or understated during the periods of currency volatility  we could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses 
a significant portion of our operating expenses are fixed in the short term and we plan our expense run rate based on our expectations of future revenues 
in addition  a significant percentage of our sales transactions are completed during the final weeks or days of each quarter and  therefore  we generally do not know whether revenues have met our expectations until after the end of the quarter 
if we have a shortfall in revenues in any given quarter  there is an immediate effect on our overall earnings 
as described more fully in footnote b to our consolidated financial statements  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment  on january  this statement requires that stock compensation expense for awards of equity instruments to employees be recognized in our financial statements based on the grant date fair value of those awards 
the adoption of this statement will cause a significant increase to our operating expenses beginning in the first quarter of we estimate that adoption will result in additional expense in of approximately million  but this amount could vary based on a number of factors including the volatility of our stock  interest rate changes or changes to our equity compensation plans 
see item a risk factors for additional risk factors that may cause our future results to differ materially from our current expectations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we regularly reevaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  allowances for product returns and exchanges  allowances for bad debts and reserves for recourse under financing transactions  the valuation of inventories  goodwill and other intangible assets  and income tax assets 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the amounts of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies most significantly affect the portrayal of our financial condition and involve our most difficult and subjective estimates and judgments 
revenue recognition and allowances for product returns and exchanges we generally recognize revenue from sales of software and software related products upon receipt of a signed purchase order or contract and product shipment to distributors or end users  provided that collection is reasonably assured  the fee is fixed or determinable and all other revenue recognition criteria of statement of position  or sop   software revenue recognition  as amended  are met 
in addition  for certain transactions where our services are non routine or essential to the delivered products  we record revenue upon satisfying the criteria of sop and obtaining customer acceptance 
within our professional video segment  much of our audio segment and our consumer video segment we follow the guidance of sop for revenue recognition because our products and services are software or software related 
however  for certain offerings in our audio segment  software is incidental to the delivered products and services 
for these products  we record revenue based on satisfying the criteria in securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition 
in connection with many of our product sale transactions  customers may purchase a maintenance and support agreement 
we recognize revenue from maintenance contracts on a ratable basis over their term 
we recognize revenue from training  installation or other services as the services are performed 
we use the residual method to recognize revenues when an order includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date and evidence of the fair value of all undelivered elements exists 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered element  typically professional services or maintenance  is deferred and the remaining portion of the total arrangement fee is recognized as revenue related to the delivered element 
if evidence of the fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist  we defer all revenues and only recognize them when delivery of those elements occurs or when fair value can be established 
fair value is typically based on the price charged when the same element is sold separately to customers 
however  in certain transactions  fair value is based on the renewal price of the undelivered element that is granted as a contractual right to the customer 
our current pricing practices are influenced primarily by product type  purchase volume  term and customer location 
we review services revenues sold separately and corresponding renewal rates on a periodic basis and update  when appropriate  our fair value for such services used for revenue recognition purposes to ensure that it reflects our recent pricing experience 
in most cases  our products do not require significant production  modification or customization of software 
installation of the products is generally routine  requires minimal effort and is not typically performed by us 
however  certain transactions  typically those involving orders from end users for a significant number of products for a single customer site  such as news broadcasters  require that we perform an installation effort that we deem to be complex and non routine 
in these situations  we do not recognize revenue for either the products shipped or the installation services until the installation is complete 
in addition  if such orders include a customer acceptance provision  no revenue is recognized until the customer s acceptance of the products and services has been received or the acceptance period has lapsed 
telephone support  enhancements and unspecified upgrades typically are provided at no additional charge during the product s initial warranty period generally between days and twelve months  which precedes commencement of the maintenance contracts 
we defer the fair value of this support period and recognize the related revenue ratably over the initial warranty period 
we also from time to time offer certain customers free upgrades or specified future products or enhancements 
for each of these elements that is undelivered at the time of product shipment  we defer the fair value of the specified upgrade  product or enhancement and recognize that revenue only upon later delivery or at the time at which the remaining contractual terms relating to the upgrade have been satisfied 
in  approximately of our revenue was derived from indirect sales channels  including authorized resellers and distributors 
within our professional video segment  our resellers and distributors are generally not granted rights to return products to us after purchase and actual product returns from them have been insignificant to date 
however  distributors of our avid xpress dv  avid xpress pro  avid mojo and avid liquid product lines have a contractual right to return a percentage of prior quarter purchases 
the return provision for these distributors has not had a material impact on our results of operations 
in contrast  some channel partners  particularly our audio and certain of our consumer video channel partners  are offered limited rights of return  stock rotation  rebates and price protection 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists  we record a provision for estimated returns and other allowances  as a reduction of revenues  in the same period that related revenues are recorded 
management estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing and maintaining a sales allowance for expected returns and other credits 
in making such estimates  we analyze historical returns and credits and the amounts of products held by major resellers and consider the impact of new product introductions  changes in customer demand  current economic conditions and other known factors 
we maintain a rolling history of returns on a product by product basis and analyze returns and credits by product category 
the amount and timing of our revenue for any period may be impacted if actual product returns or other reseller credits prove to be materially different from our estimates 
a portion of our revenue from sales of consumer video products is derived from transactions with channel partners who have unlimited return rights and from whom payment is contingent upon the product being sold through to their customers 
accordingly  revenue for these channel partners is recognized when the products are sold through to the customer instead of being recognized at the time products are shipped to the channel partners 
the company from time to time offers rebates on purchases of certain products or rebates based on purchasing volume  which are accounted for as reductions to revenue upon shipment of related products or expected achievement of purchasing volumes 
in accordance with emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products  consideration given to customers or resellers under the rebate program is recorded as a reduction to revenue because the company does not receive an identifiable benefit that is sufficiently separable from the sale of the company s products 
at the time of a sales transaction  we make an assessment of the collectibility of the amount due from the customer 
revenue is recognized only if we are reasonably assured that collection will occur 
in making this assessment  we consider customer credit worthiness and historical payment experience 
if it is determined from the outset of the arrangement that collection is not reasonably assured based upon our credit review process  revenue is recognized on a cash collected basis to the extent that the other criteria of sop and sab no 
are satisfied 
at the outset of the arrangement  we assess whether the fee associated with the order is fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties 
in assessing whether the fee is fixed or determinable  we consider the payment terms of the transaction  our collection experience in similar transactions without making concessions  and our involvement  if any  in third party financing transactions  among other factors 
if the fee is not fixed or determinable  revenue is recognized only as payments become due from the customer  provided that all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
if a significant portion of the fee is due after our normal payment terms  which are generally days  but can be up to days  after the invoice date  we evaluate whether we have sufficient history of successfully collecting past transactions with similar terms 
if that collection history is successful  then revenue is recognized upon delivery of the products  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are satisfied 
we record as revenue all amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling costs and record the actual shipping costs as a component of cost of revenues 
we record reimbursements received from customers for out of pocket expenses as revenue  with related costs recorded as cost of revenues 
allowance for bad debts and reserves for recourse under financing transactions we maintain allowances for estimated bad debt losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments for products or services 
when evaluating the adequacy of the allowances  we analyze accounts receivable balances  historical bad debt experience  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness and current economic trends 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances could be required 
we provide third party lease financing options to many of our customers 
we are not generally a party to the leases  however  during the terms of these leases  which are generally three years  we remain liable for any unpaid principal balance upon default by the end user  but such liability is limited in the aggregate 
see footnote h to our consolidated financial statements in item we record revenue from these transactions upon the shipment of our products because we believe that our collection experience with similar transactions supports our assessment that the fee is fixed or determinable 
we have operated these programs for over ten years and to date defaults under the program have consistently ranged between and 
we maintain reserves for estimated recourse losses under this financing program based on these historical default rates 
while we have experienced insignificant losses from defaults to date under this program  deterioration in the financial condition of our customers who participate in the program could require additional reserves 
inventories inventory in the digital media market  including our inventory  is subject to rapid technological change or obsolescence 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and write down inventory to its realizable value to reflect estimated obsolescence or unmarketability based upon assumptions about future inventory demand generally for the following twelve months and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than we estimate  additional inventory write downs may be required 
business combinations when we acquire new businesses  we use the purchase method of accounting as required by sfas no 
 business combinations 
we allocate the purchase price of businesses acquired to the assets  including intangible assets  acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values  with any amount in excess of such allocations designated as goodwill 
significant management judgments and assumptions are required in determining the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities  particularly acquired intangible assets 
for example  it is necessary to estimate the portion of development efforts that are associated with technology that is in process and has no alternative future use 
the valuation of purchased intangible assets is based upon estimates of the future performance and cash flows from the acquired business 
if different assumptions are used  it could materially impact the purchase price allocation and our financial position and results of operations 
goodwill and intangible assets we assess the impairment of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets on at least an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include significant negative industry or economic trends  unanticipated competition  loss of key personnel  a more likely than not expectation that a reporting unit or component thereof will be sold or otherwise disposed of  significant underperformance relative to the historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  a reduction of our market capitalization relative to our net book value and other such circumstances 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we do not amortize goodwill and certain intangible assets 
the goodwill impairment test prescribed by sfas no 
requires us to identify reporting units and to determine estimates of the fair values of our reporting units as of the date we test for impairment 
our organizational structure is based on strategic business units that offer various products to the principal markets in which our products are sold 
these strategic business units equate to our reporting units which are currently the same as our operating segments professional video  audio and consumer video 
all three of the reporting units include goodwill 
in the goodwill impairment analysis  the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value  including goodwill 
we use a discounted cash flow valuation model to determine the fair values of our reporting units 
this model focuses primarily on estimates of future revenues and profits for each reporting unit 
we estimate these amounts by evaluating historical trends  current budgets  operating plans and industry data 
if the reporting unit s carrying value exceeds its fair value  we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill and its implied fair value 
we complete our annual impairment tests as of the end of the fourth quarter of each year and to date have concluded that no impairment charge was required 
if future events cause the reporting units fair value to decline below its carrying value  an impairment charge may be required 
in the identifiable intangibles impairment analysis  if events or circumstances exist that indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable  the fair value of each asset is compared to its carrying value 
if the asset s carrying value is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value  we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value of the asset and its fair value 
the carrying value of an asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
income tax assets we record deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the net tax effects of tax credits and operating loss carryforwards and temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
we regularly review deferred tax assets for recoverability taking into consideration such factors as historical losses after deductions for stock compensation  projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires us to record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
based on the level of deferred tax assets as of december   the level of historical us losses after deductions for stock compensation and the level of outstanding stock options  which we anticipate will generate significant us tax deductions in the future  we have determined that the uncertainty regarding the realization of these assets is sufficient to warrant the continued establishment of a full valuation allowance against the us net deferred tax assets 
in  we removed the valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets in our irish manufacturing operations 
this resulted in a non cash million tax benefit recorded through our provision for income taxes 
the decision to remove the valuation allowance was based on the conclusion that it was more likely than not that the deferred tax asset in ireland would be realized 
our assessment of the valuation allowance on the us deferred tax assets could change in the future based upon our levels of pre tax income and other tax related adjustments 
removal of the valuation allowance in whole or in part would result in a non cash reduction in the provision for income taxes during the period of removal 
in addition  because a portion of the valuation allowance as of december  was established to reserve certain deferred tax assets resulting from the exercise of employee stock options  in accordance with sfas no 
and sfas r  removal of the valuation allowance related to these assets would occur upon utilization of these deferred tax assets to reduce taxes payable and would result in a credit to additional paid in capital within stockholders equity rather than the provision for income taxes 
if the valuation allowance of million as of december  were to be removed in its entirety  a million non cash reduction in income tax expense  a million credit to goodwill related to pinnacle net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and temporary differences  and a million credit to additional paid in capital would be recorded in the period of removal subject to  in the latter case  actual utilization as described above 
to the extent no valuation allowance is established for our deferred tax assets in future periods  future financial statements would reflect a non cash increase in our provision for income taxes 
results of operations prior to the third quarter of  we had classified administrative expenses incurred in europe both internally and externally as marketing and selling expense because these costs were incurred primarily to support our sales function in europe 
with the pinnacle acquisition as well as with the acquisitions of m audio  nxn and avid nordic over the past two years  we have increased the overall scope of our operations in europe to include not only sales but also research and development  manufacturing  customer service and other functions  and our general and administrative infrastructure has increased accordingly 
for this reason  we have decided to classify the administrative expenses being incurred in europe to the general and administrative expense caption in our income statement  as opposed to the marketing and selling expense caption 
all comparative periods have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation 
the amounts reclassified were million and million for and  respectively 
net revenues we develop  market  sell and support a wide range of software and hardware for digital media production  management and distribution 
our net revenues are derived mainly from the sales of computer based digital  nonlinear media editing systems and related peripherals  licensing of software and sales of related software maintenance contracts 
we are organized into strategic business units that reflect the principal markets in which our products are sold professional video  audio and consumer video 
discrete financial information is available for each business unit and the operating results of these business units are evaluated regularly to make decisions regarding the allocation of resources and to assess performance 
as such  these business units represent our reportable segments under sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
our professional video segment produces non linear video and film editing systems to improve the productivity of video and film editors and broadcasters by enabling them to edit video  film and sound in a faster  easier  more creative and more cost effective manner than by use of traditional analog tape based systems 
the products in this operating segment are designed to provide capabilities for editing and finishing feature films  television shows  broadcast news programs  commercials  music videos and corporate and consumer videos 
our audio segment produces digital audio systems for the audio market 
this operating segment includes products developed to provide audio recording  editing  signal processing and automated mixing 
this segment also includes our m audio product family acquired in august our consumer video segment develops and markets products that are aimed primarily at the consumer market  which allow users to create  edit  view and distribute rich media content including video  photographs and audio using a personal computer and camcorder 
this segment is comprised of specific product lines acquired as part of the august pinnacle acquisition

this increase in net product revenues was also offset in part by lower average selling prices of certain of our products 
average selling prices include the mix of products high or low end sold  impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the impact of price changes and discounting 
for the audio segment  million of the increase in net revenues for was due to the acquisition of m audio  which occurred in august we also saw increases in our core digidesign pro tools products for the professional and home markets in as compared to the consumer video segment was formed in the third quarter of with the acquisition of pinnacle  therefore  there are no comparative revenues for all of the revenues for represent revenue from the pinnacle consumer business from the acquisition date of august  through december  service revenues consist primarily of maintenance contracts  installation services and training 
professional video services revenues resulting from the pinnacle acquisition were million from the acquisition date of august  through december  the remaining increase in professional video service revenues comes primarily from increases in maintenance contracts sold on our products

average selling prices also include the impact of price changes  discounting and mix higher or lower end of products sold 
for the audio segment  the revenue growth in is attributable to the increased sales volume of digidesign s core products as well as the acquisition of m audio in august of  which accounted for million of the audio revenue growth 
net revenues derived through indirect channels were approximately for compared to for and for the increase in direct selling in and  as compared to  was due primarily to the growth in sales to our broadcast news customers  which generally require a longer selling cycle with more direct support and the acquisition of avid nordic in september we expect sales to broadcast customers will be an area of continued revenue growth in the future

gross profit cost of revenues consists primarily of costs associated with the procurement of components  the assembly  testing and distribution of finished products  warehousing  post sales customer support costs related to maintenance contract revenue and other services  and royalties for third party software and hardware included in our products 
it also includes the amortization of developed technology assets resulting from our acquisitions 
the resulting gross margin fluctuates based on factors such as the mix of products sold  the cost and proportion of third party hardware and software included in the systems sold  the offering of product upgrades  price discounts and other sales promotion programs  the distribution channels through which products are sold  the timing of new product introductions  sales of aftermarket hardware products such as disk drives and currency exchange rate fluctuations  and the timing and specific technology acquired through our acquisitions

amortization of technology included in costs of sales represents the amortization of developed technology assets resulting from the pinnacle acquisition on august  and  to a lesser extent  the m audio and wizoo acquisitions  which are discussed below under the caption amortization of and impairment of intangible assets 
as discussed below  we would expect the amortization of acquisition related intangibles in to be higher than in  as it will include the full year impact of the pinnacle and wizoo acquisitions

in process research and development during  we recorded in process research and development  or r d  charges of million and million related to the acquisitions of pinnacle and wizoo  respectively 
the allocations of the purchase price to in process r d were determined through management s consideration of valuations prepared by independent valuation specialists and represent product development efforts that were underway at pinnacle or wizoo at the time of acquisition for which technological feasibility had not yet been established 
technological feasibility is established when either of the following criteria is met the detail program design has been completed  documented and traced to product specifications and its high risk development issues have been resolved  or a working model of the product has been finished and determined to be complete and consistent with the product design 
at the time of acquisition  neither pinnacle nor wizoo had a completed product design or working model for the in process technology  and we believe that there is no future alternative use for such technology beyond the stated purpose of the specific r d project 
accordingly  the in process r d of million was expensed during the key assumptions within the valuation process consisted of the expected completion dates for the in process projects  estimated costs to complete the projects  revenue and expense projections assuming future release  and a risk adjusted discount rate 
the discount rate considers risks such as delays to bring the products to market and competitive pressures 
the valuations of pinnacle and wizoo in process r d used discount rates of and  respectively 
the in process r d charge for the pinnacle acquisition related primarily to pinnacle s on air and home editing software products 
future versions of deko and thunder  pinnacle s on air products  accounted for approximately million of the charge 
these products had an estimated cost to complete of million at the acquisition date and are scheduled for release in studio  pinnacle s home editing software  represented approximately million of the charge and carried an estimated cost to complete of million at the acquisition date 
studio was released in the third quarter of and a subsequent release is planned for restructuring and other costs in december  we implemented a restructuring program under which employees worldwide were terminated and a portion of a leased facility in montreal  canada was vacated 
in connection with these actions  we recorded charges of million for employment terminations and million for abandoned space 
the estimated annual cost savings expected to result from these restructuring activities total million

the remaining restructuring charge of million primarily resulted from a revised estimate of the lease obligation associated with a facility that was vacated as part of a restructuring plan in the revision became necessary when one of the subtenants in the facility gave notice of their intention to discontinue their sublease 
restructuring activity in was primarily related to paying down existing obligations on vacated facilities 
additionally  in september  we recorded a charge of million to reflect the decrease in rent to be received from one of our subtenants and reversed a charge of million associated with abandoned space in tewksbury  massachusetts 
our restructuring actions during consisted of severance and facility charges made to increase efficiencies and reduce expenses and a revision to a previous restructuring charge recorded on abandoned space

provision for benefit from income taxes we account for income taxes under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes

the tax rate in each year is significantly affected by net changes in the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
the net tax provision of million for reflected a current tax provision of million and a non cash deferred tax charge of million related to utilization of acquired net operating loss carryforwards  offset by a million tax benefit related to the amortization of non deductible acquisition related intangible assets and other benefits totaling million

the tax provisions noted above for  and were substantially comprised of taxes payable by our foreign subsidiaries with only alternative minimum tax provided on anticipated us taxable profits 
the tax provision in each year is significantly affected by net changes in the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability taking into consideration such factors as historical losses after deductions for stock compensation  projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
sfas no 
requires us to record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
based on the level of deferred tax assets as of december   the level of historical us losses after deductions for stock compensation and the level of outstanding stock options which we anticipate will generate significant us tax deductions in the future  we have determined that the uncertainty regarding the realization of these assets is sufficient to warrant the continued establishment of a full valuation allowance against the us net deferred tax assets 
in the quarter ended december   we removed the valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets of our irish manufacturing operations 
the decision to remove the valuation allowance was based on the conclusion that it was more likely than not that the deferred tax asset in ireland would be realized 
due to the removal of the valuation allowance  we now have a non cash provision for income taxes related to our irish operations 
liquidity and capital resources we have funded our operations in recent years through cash flows from operations as well as through stock option exercises from our employee stock plans

at december  and  we held inventory in the amounts of million and million  respectively 
these balances include stockroom  spares and demonstration equipment inventories at various locations and inventory at customer sites related to shipments for which we have not yet recognized revenue 
we review these balances regularly for excess quantities or potential obsolescence and make appropriate adjustments to write down the inventories to reflect their estimated realizable value 
of the million increase in inventories from december  to  approximately million relates to the acquisition of pinnacle 
the balance of the increase is primarily the result of a million increase in inventories held by our audio segment 
accounts receivable increased by million to million at december  from million at december   driven primarily by the year over year increase in net revenues including the impact of the acquisition of pinnacle 
these balances are net of allowances for sales returns  bad debts and customer rebates  all of which we estimate and record based on historical experience 
days sales outstanding in accounts receivable increased from days at december  to days at december  the increase in days sales outstanding is primarily attributable to the relative proportion of solution sales in each period  which were higher in the fourth quarter of than in the fourth quarter of these sales are typically paid for prior to recognition and therefore lower our days sales outstanding in the period when revenue is recognized

however  this amount could increase in the event we enter into strategic business acquisitions or for other reasons 
as part of the agreement to acquire avid nordic  we were required to make additional payments to the former shareholders of avid nordic of up to euro million contingent upon the operating results of avid nordic ab through august   with the payments to be recorded as additional purchase consideration  allocated to goodwill

in connection with restructuring efforts during and prior periods  as well as with the identification in and of excess space in various locations  as of december   we have future cash obligations of approximately million under leases for which we have vacated the underlying facilities 
we have an associated restructuring accrual of million at december  representing the excess of our lease commitments on space no longer used by us over expected payments to be received on subleases of such facilities 
this restructuring accrual requires significant estimates and assumptions  including sub lease income assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions are monitored on a quarterly basis for changes in circumstances and any corresponding adjustments to the accrual are recorded in the period when such changes are known 
the lease payments will be made over the remaining terms of the leases  which have varying expiration dates through  unless we are able to negotiate an earlier termination 
in connection with the pinnacle acquisition in august  we recorded restructuring accruals totaling million related to severance million and lease or other contract terminations million

the severance payments will be made over the next twelve months and the lease payments will be made over the remaining terms of the leases  which have varying expiration dates through all payments related to restructuring will be funded through working capital 
see note l of the consolidated financial statements in item for the activity in the restructuring and other costs accrual for the years ended december   and our cash requirements vary depending upon factors such as our planned growth  capital expenditures  the possible acquisitions of businesses or technologies complementary to our business and obligations under past restructuring programs 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and funds generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
in the event that we require additional financing  we believe that we will be able to obtain such financing  however  there can be no assurance that we would be successful in doing so  or that we could do so on favorable terms

during the terms of these financing arrangements  which are generally for three years  we remain liable for a portion of the unpaid principal balance in the event of a default on the lease by the end user  but our liability is limited in the aggregate based on a percentage of initial amounts funded or  in certain cases  amounts of unpaid balances

recent accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of accounting research bulletin no 
 which is the result of the fasb s efforts to converge us accounting standards for inventories with international accounting standards 
sfas no 
requires idle facility expenses  freight  handling costs and wasted material spoilage costs to be recognized as current period charges 
it also requires that the allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas no 
will be effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  ie  for us  beginning january  
we are currently evaluating the impact of sfas no 
on our consolidated financial statements 
the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
on december   the fasb released sfas no 
r 
this new accounting standard requires all forms of stock compensation  including stock options issued to employees  to be reflected as an expense in our financial statements 
on april   the sec approved a rule that delayed the effective date of sfas no 
r for public companies to annual  rather than interim  periods that begin after june  sfas no 
r allows three alternative methods of transitioning to the standard modified prospective application  or mpa  modified retrospective application  or mra  to all prior periods  or mra to only interim periods of the year of adoption 
we intend to use the mpa without restatement alternative and to apply the revised standard beginning january  under the modified prospective application  all unvested awards that were previously included as part of the pro forma net income disclosure and are outstanding on the effective date would be charged to expense over the remaining vesting period  without any changes in measurement 
all new awards that are granted or modified after the effective date will be expensed using the sfas no 
r measurement model 
the adoption of the revised standard will result in higher recorded operating expenses and lower earnings per share 
we estimate that adoption will result in additional expense in of approximately million  but this amount could vary based on a number of factors including the volatility of our stock  interest rate changes or changes to our equity compensation plans 
see footnote b to our consolidated financial statements for the pro forma impact on net income and net income per common share as if we had historically applied the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
to stock based employee awards 
on june   the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  a replacement of apb opinion no 
 accounting changes and statement no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
sfas no 
changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
previously  most voluntary changes in accounting principles required recognition in a cumulative effect adjustment within net income of the period of the change 
sfas no 
requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
sfas no 
is effective for accounting changes made in fiscal years beginning after december   however  this standard does not change the transition provisions of any existing accounting pronouncements 
we will determine the impact of this standard on our consolidated financial statements when an accounting change or error correction occurs 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions 
previously  apb opinion no 
had required that the accounting for an exchange of a productive asset for a similar productive asset or an equivalent interest in the same or similar productive asset should be based on the recorded amount of the asset relinquished 
the amendments made by sfas no 
are based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
further  the amendments eliminate the narrow exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replace it with a broader exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance  in essence increasing the number of exchanges that will be fair valued in the future 
sfas no 
was effective in the third quarter of the provisions of sfas no 
are applied prospectively 
the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in march  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional retirement obligations an interpretation of sfas no 
 or fin no 
this interpretation clarifies the timing of when a liability should be recognized for legal obligations associated with the retirement of a tangible long lived asset 
in addition  the interpretation clarifies the treatment when there is insufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
fin no 
is effective no later than the end of fiscal years ending after december  retrospective application for interim financial information is permitted but is not required and early adoption is encouraged 
the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued staff position no 
fas  accounting for electronic equipment waste obligations  or fsp  which provides guidance on the accounting for obligations associated with the european union  or eu  directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment  or the weee directive 
fsp provides guidance on how to account for the effects of the weee directive with respect to historical waste associated with products in the market on or before august  fsp is required to be applied to the later of the first reporting period ending after june  or the date of the adoption of the weee directive into law by the applicable eu member country 
we are in the process of registering with the member countries  as appropriate  and are still awaiting guidance from these countries with respect to the compliance costs and obligations for historical waste 
we will continue to work with each country to obtain guidance and will accrue for compliance costs when they are probable and reasonably estimable 
the accruals for these compliance costs may have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations when guidance is issued by each member country 
on october   the president signed the american jobs creation act of  or the act 
the act creates a temporary incentive for us corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an percent dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations 
the act also creates a deduction on a percentage of the lesser of qualified production activities income or taxable income 
although these deductions are subject to a number of limitations and significant uncertainty remains as to how to interpret numerous provisions in the act  we believe that we have the information necessary to make an informed decision on the impact of the act 
based on the information available  we have determined that our cash position in the us is sufficient to fund anticipated needs 
we also believe that the repatriation of income earned abroad would result in significant foreign withholding taxes that otherwise would not have been incurred  as well as additional us tax liabilities that may not be sufficiently offset by foreign tax credits 
therefore  we do not currently plan to repatriate any income earned abroad 
the qualified production activities deduction was not available to us in due to the fact that we incurred a loss for us tax purposes 
the qualified production activities deduction is not available to companies that incur a loss for the taxable year 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk foreign currency exchange risk we derive more than half of our revenues from customers outside the united states 
this business is  for the most part  transacted through international subsidiaries and generally in the currency of the end user customers 
therefore  we are exposed to the risks that changes in foreign currency could adversely impact our revenues  net income and cash flow 
to hedge against the foreign exchange exposure of certain forecasted receivables  payables and cash balances of our foreign subsidiaries  we enter into short term foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
there are two objectives of our foreign currency forward exchange contract program to offset any foreign exchange currency risk associated with cash receipts expected to be received from our customers over the next day period and to offset the impact of foreign currency exchange on our net monetary assets denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
these forward exchange contracts typically mature within days of purchase 
we record gains and losses associated with currency rate changes on these contracts in results of operations  offsetting gains and losses on the related assets and liabilities 
the success of this hedging program depends on forecasts of transaction activity in the various currencies and contract rates versus financial statement rates 
to the extent that these forecasts are overstated or understated during the periods of currency volatility  we could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses 
at december   we had million of forward exchange contracts outstanding  denominated in the euro  british pound  swedish krona  danish kroner  norwegian krone  canadian dollar  singapore dollar and korean won  as a hedge against forecasted foreign currency denominated receivables  payables and cash balances 
for the year ended december   net gains resulting from forward exchange contracts of million were included in results of operations  offset by net transaction and remeasurement losses on the related assets and liabilities of million 
a hypothetical change in foreign currency rates would not have a material impact on our results of operations  assuming the above mentioned forecast of foreign currency exposure is accurate  because the impact on the forward contracts as a result of a change would at least partially offset the impact on the asset and liability positions of our foreign subsidiaries 
interest rate risk at december   we held million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  including short term corporate obligations  asset backed securities  commercial paper and us and canadian government and government agency obligations 
marketable securities are classified as available for sale and are recorded on the balance sheet at market value  with any unrealized gain or loss recorded in other comprehensive income loss 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair market value of these instruments due to their short maturity
