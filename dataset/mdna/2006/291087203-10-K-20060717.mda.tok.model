in the following discussions  most percentages and dollar amounts have been rounded to aid presentation 
as a result  all figures are approximations 
results of operations as a result of the sale of ssg  the results of operations of ssg have been presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented  and we now operate in one segment  the consumer electronics segment 
accordingly  only the consumer electronics segment is presented in the following management s discussion and analysis 
the following table summarizes certain financial information for the fiscal years ended march in thousands net revenues    cost of sales    other operating costs and expenses    selling  general and administrative    acquisition costs incurred recovered  non cash compensation operating income    interest expense  net  income before income taxes    benefit provision for income taxes   net income from continuing operations   results of operations fiscal compared with fiscal net revenues net revenues for fiscal increased million  or  to million as compared to million for fiscal net revenues are comprised of emerson r branded product sales  themed product sales and licensing revenues 
emerson r branded product sales are earned from the sale of products bearing the emerson r or hh scott r brand name  themed product sales represent products sold bearing a certain theme or character  and licensing revenues are derived from licensing the emerson r and hh scott r brand names to licensees for a fee 
the increase in net revenues was comprised of i emerson r branded products sales decreased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  a decrease of million  or  primarily resulting from decreased sales volumes in the audio product category  ii themed product sales increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  an increase of million  primarily due to increased nickelodeon sales volume  and iii licensing revenues decreased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  primarily due to lower sales volumes from our video licensing agreements 
this downward trend in our video license revenue has continued over the last several quarters and is expected to continue in future quarters 
cost of sales in absolute terms  cost of sales increased million  or  to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal cost of sales  as a percentage of net revenues  increased from in fiscal to in fiscal the increase in cost of sales in relative terms was primarily due to the proportionate decrease in license revenues as a percentage of sales revenues 
the cost of sales as a percentage of sales revenues less license revenues was largely unchanged as it increased to in from in  reflecting continued price pressure from our major competitors 
gross profit margins continue to be subject to competitive pressures arising from pricing strategies associated with the price categories of the consumer electronics market in which we compete 
our products are generally placed in the low to medium priced category of the market  which has a tendency to be highly competitive 
other operating costs and expenses other operating costs and expenses include those components as described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
as a result of increased activity in these areas  other operating costs and expenses as a percentage of net revenues were in both fiscal and fiscal in absolute terms  other operating costs and expenses increased  or  to million for fiscal as compared to million in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses s  g a s  g a  as a percentage of net revenues  were in fiscal as compared to in fiscal s  g a  in absolute terms  increased million  or  to million in fiscal as compared to million for fiscal the increase in s  g a in absolute terms between fiscal and was primarily due to increased sales commissions of  an increase in personnel expenditures of  increased advertising costs of  an increase in accounts receivable reserves of  and an increase in depreciation expenses of  these expenses were partially offset by a decrease in professional fees of  acquisition costs incurred recovered in fiscal  adjustments to acquisition costs incurred in the prior year were recorded resulting in a recovery of such costs of  or of net revenues  compared to expenses of  in fiscal these costs were associated with contemplated acquisition transactions that were not completed 
non cash compensation relate to stock options expense associated with the early adoption of sfas r share based payments 
stock based costs increased to  of net revenues in fiscal compared to  of net revenues in fiscal  including approximately and  respectively  associated with the cost of warrants issued in exchange for consulting services 
interest expense  net interest expense decreased  or  to  of net revenues in fiscal from million of net revenues in fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to decreased borrowings and borrowing costs as well as an increase in foreign interest income 
benefits provision for income taxes our provision for income taxes  which primarily represents the deferred tax charges associated with our profits in the united states  resulted in a benefit of  for fiscal  or of net revenues  as compared to million for fiscal  or of net revenues 
income from continuing operations as a result of the foregoing factors  net income from continuing operations amounted to approximately million of net revenues for fiscal as compared to million of net revenues in fiscal results of operations fiscal compared with fiscal net revenues net revenues for fiscal increased million  or  to million as compared to million for fiscal net revenues are comprised of emerson r branded product sales  themed product sales and licensing revenues 
emerson r branded product sales are earned from the sale of products bearing the emerson r or hh scott r brand name  themed product sales represent products sold bearing a certain theme or character  and licensing revenues are derived from licensing the emerson r and hh scott r brand names to licensees for a fee

cost of sales in absolute terms  cost of sales increased million  or  to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal cost of sales  as a percentage of net revenues  increased from in fiscal to in fiscal the increase in cost of sales in relative terms was primarily due to lower margins on emerson r branded and themed products  primarily attributable to competitive market conditions 
gross profit margins continue to be subject to competitive pressures arising from pricing strategies associated with the price categories of the consumer electronics market in which we compete  accordingly  a change in revenues does not directly correlate to a change in unit volume 
our products are generally placed in the low to medium priced category of the market  which has a tendency to be highly competitive 
other operating costs and expenses other operating costs and expenses include those components as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as a result of increased activity in these areas  other operating costs and expenses as a percentage of net revenues were in fiscal as compared to in fiscal in absolute terms  other operating costs and expenses increased  or  to million for fiscal as compared to million in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses s  g a s  g a  as a percentage of net revenues  were in fiscal as compared to in fiscal s  g a  in absolute terms  increased million  or  to million in fiscal as compared to million for fiscal the increase in s  g a in absolute terms between fiscal and was primarily due to increased freight out costs totaling million  and increased advertising expenditures of  partially offset by a decrease in professional fees of  offset by smaller variances in other s  g a expenses 
acquisition costs recovered incurred adjustments to acquisition costs incurred in the prior year were recorded in fiscal  resulting in a recovery of such costs of  or of net revenues 
for fiscal  acquisition costs were million  or of net revenues  due to two unsuccessful acquisition attempts during the year 
stock based costs stock based costs relate to the cost of warrants associated with consulting service agreements and stock options expense associated with the early adoption of sfas r share based payments 
stock based costs decreased from  of net revenues in fiscal to  of net revenues in fiscal  including approximately  related to the early adoption of sfas r 
interest expense  net interest expense increased  or  to million of consumer electronics net revenues in fiscal from million of net revenues in fiscal the increase was attributable primarily to increased borrowings and borrowing costs during fiscal provision for income taxes our provision for income taxes  which primarily represents the deferred tax charges associated with our profits in the united states  was million for fiscal  or of consumer electronics net revenues  as compared to million for fiscal  or of consumer electronics net revenues 
income from continuing operations as a result of the foregoing factors  net income from continuing operations totaled million of net revenues in fiscal as compared to  less than of net revenues in fiscal liquidity and capital resources as of march   we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million  compared to approximately million at march  working capital increased to million at march  as compared to at march  the increase in cash and cash equivalents of approximately million was primarily due to cash received from the sale of the ssg business and other financing and operating activities as described below 
operating cash flow provided by continuing operating activities was approximately million for fiscal  resulting from income before depreciation and amortization and deferred tax expenses of approximately million  primarily offset by increases in accounts receivable 
growth in accounts receivable accounted for a usage of cash of approximately million as a result of the shift from the direct import business which represents sales under lc arrangements to domestic business which represents sales on account  and an increase in consumer demand 
decreases in restricted cash of million and inventories of million primarily contributed to the increase in sources of cash provided by continuing operations 
net cash provided by investing activities of million for fiscal  resulted primarily from the proceeds received on the sale of ssg 
net cash used by financing activities was million for fiscal cash was primarily utilized for the repayments of long term borrowings in the financing of inventory purchases due to the higher level of sales in the current fiscal year  as well as the continuing shift from the direct import to domestic business 
on december   we entered into a million revolving credit agreement with wachovia bank  national association 
the million revolving line of credit facility provides for revolving loans subject to individual maximums which  in the aggregate  are not to exceed the lesser of million or a borrowing base as defined in the loan agreement 
the borrowing base amount is established by specified percentages of eligible accounts receivables and inventories and bears interest ranging from prime plus to or  at our election  the london interbank offered rate libor plus to depending on excess availability 
pursuant to the loan agreement  we are restricted from  among other things  paying certain cash dividends  and entering into certain transactions without the lender s prior consent and are subject to certain leverage financial covenants 
borrowings under the loan agreement are secured by substantially all of our tangible assets 
at march   there were approximately million of letters of credit outstanding under this facility 
at march   we were in compliance with the covenants on our credit facilities 
our foreign subsidiaries maintain various credit facilities  aggregating million  with foreign banks consisting of the following o two letter of credit facilities totaling million which is used for inventory purchases  and o two back to back letter of credit facilities totaling million 
at march   our foreign subsidiaries pledged approximately million in certificates of deposit to these banks to assure the availability of the million credit facilities 
the compensating amount of million of restricted cash is legally restricted from use for general business purposes 
at march   there were approximately million of letters of credit outstanding under these credit facilities 
these letter of credit facilities contain a net worth covenant of the foreign subsidiaries with which the subsidiaries were in compliance at march  short term liquidity 
liquidity is impacted by our seasonality in that we generally record the majority of our annual sales in the quarters ending september and december 
this requires us to maintain higher inventory levels during the quarters ending june and september  therefore increasing the working capital needs during these periods 
additionally  we receive the largest percentage of product returns in the quarter ending march 
the higher level of returns during this period adversely impacts our collection activity  and therefore our liquidity 
management believes that continued sales margin improvement and the policies in place for returned products  should continue to favorably impact our cash flow 
in fiscal  products representing approximately of net revenues were imported directly to our customers 
this contributes significantly to emerson s liquidity in that this inventory does not need to be financed directly by us 
our principal existing sources of cash are generated from operations and borrowings available under our revolving credit facilities 
as of march   we had million of borrowing capacity available under our million revolving credit facilities  of which there were million of letters of credit outstanding  and there were no loans outstanding 
in addition  at march   we had million of letter of credit facilities  of which approximately million was available 
we believe that our existing sources of cash  including cash flows generated from operations  will be sufficient to support our existing operations over the next months  provided  however  we may raise additional financing  which may include the issuance of equity securities  or the incurrence of additional debt  in connection with our operations or if we elect to grow our business through acquisitions 
contractual obligations the following summarizes our obligations at march  for the periods shown in thousands payment due by period less than more than total year years years years notes and mortgages payable capital lease obligations leases     total     as of march   there were no material capital expenditure commitments and no substantial commitments for purchase orders outside the normal purchase orders used to secure product 
off balance sheet arrangements 
we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted within the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we consider certain accounting policies related to inventories  trade accounts receivables  impairment of long lived assets  valuation of deferred tax assets  sales return reserves and cooperative advertising accruals to be critical policies due to the estimation processes involved in each 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the first in  first out basis 
we record inventory reserves to reduce the carrying value of inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory reserves may be required 
conversely  if market conditions improve  such reserves are reduced 
trade accounts receivable 
we extend credit based upon evaluations of a customer s financial condition and provide for any anticipated credit losses in our financial statements based upon management s estimates and ongoing reviews of recorded allowances 
if the financial conditions of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional reserves may be required 
conversely  reserves are reduced to reflect credit and collection improvements 
income taxes 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce the amount of our deferred tax assets to the amount that management estimates is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event that we determined that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  if it was determined that we would not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
sales return reserves 
our management must make estimates of potential future product returns related to current period product revenue 
management analyzes historical returns  current economic trends and changes in customer demand for our products when evaluating the adequacy of the reserve for sales returns 
management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the sales return reserves in any accounting period 
if actual sales returns increase above the historical return rates  then additional reserves may be required 
conversely  the sales return reserve could be decreased if the actual return rates are less than the historical return rates  which were used to establish such sales return reserve 
cooperative advertising accruals 
cooperative advertising programs  promotions and other volume based incentives  which are provided to retailers and distributors for advertising and sales promotions  are accounted for on an accrual basis as a reduction in net revenues in the period in which the related sales are recognized as per eitf accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer 
if additional cooperative advertising programs  promotions and other volume based incentives are required to promote the company s products  then additional reserves may be required 
conversely  reserves are decreased to reflect the lesser need for cooperative advertising programs

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk inflation  foreign currency  and interest rates neither inflation nor currency fluctuations had a significant effect on our results of operations during fiscal our exposure to currency fluctuations has been minimized by the use of us dollar denominated purchase orders 
emerson purchases virtually all of its products from manufacturers located in china 
the interest on borrowings under our credit facilities is based on the prime rate or libor  at our option  on the revolving credit agreement 
while a significant increase in interest rates could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations  management believes that given the present economic climate  interest rates are expected to increase  but not so significantly during the coming year as to have a material adverse effect or our financial condition and results of operations
