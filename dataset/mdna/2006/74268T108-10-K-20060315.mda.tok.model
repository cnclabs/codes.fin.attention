overview procentury is a holding company that underwrites selected property and casualty and surety insurance through its subsidiaries collectively known as century insurance group 
as a niche company  we offer specialty insurance products designed to meet specific insurance needs of targeted insured groups 
the excess and surplus lines market provides an alternative market for customers with hard to place risks and risks that insurance companies licensed by the state in which the insurance policy is sold  which are also referred to as admitted insurers  specifically refuse to write 
when we underwrite within the excess and surplus lines market  we are selective in the lines of business and types of risks we choose to write 
typically  the development of these specialty insurance products is generated through proposals brought to us by an agent or broker seeking coverage for a specific group of clients 
we evaluate our insurance operations by monitoring key measures of growth and profitability 
the following provides further explanation of the key gaap measures that we use to evaluate our results gross written premiums 
gross written premiums are the sum of direct written premiums and assumed written premiums 
we use gross written premiums  which excludes the impact of premiums ceded to reinsurers  as a measure of the underlying growth of our insurance business from period to period 

table of contents net written premiums 
net written premiums are the sum of direct written premiums and assumed written premiums less ceded written premiums 
we use net written premiums  primarily in relation to gross written premiums  to measure the amount of business retained after cessions to reinsurers 
earned premiums 
earned premiums are the portion of a premium paid by an insured that has been allocated to our revenue  loss experience  expenses  and profit year to date 
loss ratio 
loss ratio is the ratio expressed as a percentage of losses and loss expenses incurred to premiums earned 
loss ratio generally is measured on both a gross direct and assumed and net gross less ceded basis 
we use the gross loss ratio as a measure of the overall underwriting profitability of the insurance business we write and to assess the adequacy of our pricing 
our net loss ratio is meaningful in evaluating our financial results  which are net of ceded reinsurance  as reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
expense ratio 
expense ratio is the ratio expressed as a percentage of net operating expenses to premiums earned and measures a company s operational efficiency in producing  underwriting and administering its insurance business 
we reduce our operating expenses by ancillary income excluding net investment income and realized gains losses on securities to calculate our net operating expenses 
due to our historically high levels of reinsurance  we calculate our expense ratio on both a gross basis before the effect of ceded reinsurance and a net basis after the effect of ceded reinsurance 
although the net basis is meaningful in evaluating our financial results that are net of ceded reinsurance  as reflected in our consolidated financial statements  we believe that the gross expense ratio better reflects the operational efficiency of the underlying business and is a better measure of future trends 
interest expense is not included in the calculation of the expense ratio 
combined ratio 
combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio and measures a company s overall underwriting profit 
if the combined ratio is at or above  an insurance company cannot be profitable without investment income and may not be profitable if investment income is insufficient 
we use the combined ratio in evaluating our overall underwriting profitability and as a measure for comparing our profitability relative to the profitability of our competitors 
critical accounting policies it is important to understand our accounting policies in order to understand our financial statements 
management considers certain of these policies to be critical to the presentation of our financial results  since they require management to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures at the financial reporting date and throughout the period being reported upon 
certain of the estimates result from judgments that can be subjective and complex and consequently actual results may differ from these estimates  which would be reflected in future periods 
our most critical accounting policies involve the reporting of loss and loss expense reserves including losses that have occurred but were not reported to us by the financial reporting date  reinsurance recoverables  the impairment of investments  deferred policy acquisition costs and federal income taxes 
loss and loss expense reserves 
loss and loss expense reserves represent an estimate of the expected cost of the ultimate settlement and administration of losses  based on facts and circumstances then known 
we use actuarial methodologies to assist us in establishing these estimates  including judgments relative to estimates of future claims severity and frequency  length of time to develop to ultimate resolution  judicial theories of liability and other third party factors that are often beyond our control 
due to the inherent uncertainty associated with the cost of unsettled and unreported claims  the ultimate liability may be different from the original estimate 
such estimates are regularly reviewed and updated and any resulting adjustments are included in the current period s results 
additional information regarding our loss and loss expense reserves can be found in results of operations expenses losses and loss expenses incurred  business loss and loss expense reserves  and note to our audited consolidated financial statements  all of which are included in this report 

table of contents reinsurance recoverables 
reinsurance recoverables on paid and unpaid losses  net  are established for the portion of our loss and loss expense reserves that are ceded to reinsurers 
reinsurance recoverables are determined based in part on the terms and conditions of reinsurance contracts which could be subject to interpretations that differ from our own based on judicial theories of liability 
in addition  we bear credit risk with respect to our reinsurers which can be significant considering that certain of the reserves remain outstanding for an extended period of time 
we are required to pay losses even if a reinsurer fails to meet its obligations under the applicable reinsurance agreement 
see business reinsurance and note to our audited consolidated financial statements  both included in this report 
impairment of investments 
impairment of investment securities results in a charge to operations when a market decline below cost is deemed to be other than temporary 
under the company s accounting policy for equity securities and fixed maturity securities  an impairment is deemed to be other than temporary unless the company has both the ability and intent to hold the investment for a reasonable period until the security s forecasted recovery and evidence exists indicating that recovery will occur in a reasonable period of time 
for other fixed maturity and equity securities  an other than temporary impairment charge is taken when the company does not have the ability and intent to hold the security until the forecasted recovery or if it is no longer probable that the company will recover all amounts due under the contractual terms of the security 
many criteria are considered during this process including  but not limited to  the current fair value as compared to amortized cost or cost  as appropriate  of the security  the amount and length of time a security s fair value has been below amortized cost or cost  specific credit issues and financial prospects related to the issuer  the company s intent to hold or dispose of the security  and current economic conditions 
other than temporary impairment losses result in a permanent reduction to the cost basis of the underlying investment 
additionally  for certain securitized financial assets with contractual cash flows including asset backed securities  fasb emerging task force eitf  recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased and retained beneficial interests in securitized financial assets  requires us to periodically update our best estimate of cash flows over the life of the security 
if management determines that the fair value of a securitized financial asset is less than its carrying amount and there has been a decrease in the present value of the estimated cash flows since the last revised estimate  considering both timing and amount  then an other than temporary impairment is recognized 
for additional detail regarding our investment portfolio at december  and  including disclosures regarding other than temporary declines in investment value  see investment portfolio below and note to our audited consolidated financial statements  both included in this report 
deferred policy acquisition costs 
we defer commissions  premium taxes and certain other costs that vary with and are primarily related to the acquisition of insurance contracts 
these costs are capitalized and charged to expense in proportion to premium revenue recognized 
the method followed in computing deferred policy acquisition costs limits the amount of such deferred costs to their estimated realizable value  which gives effect to the premium to be earned  related investment income  anticipated losses and settlement expenses and certain other costs expected to be incurred as the premium is earned 
judgments as to ultimate recoverability of such deferred costs are highly dependent upon estimated future loss costs associated with the written premiums 
see note to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this report 
federal income taxes 
the company provides for federal income taxes based on amounts the company believes it ultimately will owe 
inherent in the provision for federal income taxes are estimates regarding the deductibility of certain items and the realization of certain tax credits 
in the event the ultimate deductibility of certain items or the realization of certain tax credits differs from estimates  the company may be required to significantly change the provision for federal income taxes recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
any such change could significantly affect the amounts reported in the consolidated statements of income 
we utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income tax 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and 
table of contents operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amounts more likely than not to be realized 
see note to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this report 
results of operations the table below summarizes certain operating results and key measures we use in monitoring and evaluating our operations 
the information is intended to summarize and supplement information contained in our consolidated financial statements and to assist the reader in gaining a better understanding of our results of operations years ended december  in thousands selected financial data gross written premiums net premiums earned net investment income net realized investment losses gains total revenues total expenses other transactions loss on sale of minority interest in subsidiary  net discontinued operations net income key financial ratios loss and loss expense ratio expense ratio combined ratio overview of operating results year ended december  compared to year ended december  we reported net income of million for the year ended december  compared to net income of million for the same period in included in the net income for is million of after tax losses related to the fall hurricane season 
prior to  hurricane losses have not had a significant impact to net income 
without the impact of the hurricanes  net income would have increased over as a direct result of our growth in our net premiums earned and an increase in our investment income 
more specifically  our net premiums earned increased to million in from million in included in this increase is growth in our gross written premium from our casualty segment of and from our property segment 
our casualty business continues to grow profitably with stable rates and a current accident year loss and loss expense ratio of 
the property market in general did not perform as well as the casualty market given the downward pricing pressure from standard carriers that began in and continued into despite this tighter market  we were still able to grow while only slightly decreasing our average rate 
our current year loss and loss expense ratio for the property business was  which included related to the fall hurricane season 

table of contents in addition  we reported a increase in net investment income from million in to million in this increase is a result of our operating cash flows and higher pretax investment yields 
in addition  we continued our efforts in to increase our after tax yield by increasing our allocation to tax exempt municipal bonds 
as a result of the relationship between our pretax income  which was adversely affected by the hurricane losses  and increase in our tax exempt municipal bonds  we reported an annual effective tax rate of in compared to in the combined ratio increased to in from in our loss and loss expense ratio increased primarily as a result of the current year hurricane losses and the slight premium rate decrease that resulted late in and into the first half of in addition  included in our loss and loss expenses is million in incurred amounts related to prior accident years compared to million in our expense ratio increased in from in to at the end of this increase is a direct result of our efforts in our first year of required compliance with sarbanes oxley section year ended december  compared to year ended december  net income increased to million for the year ended december   compared to net income of  for the same period in the increase in net income was primarily attributable to an increase in net earned premium of million principally from an increase in the volume of business and slightly offset by rate declines in both the property and casualty lines of business 
in addition  we experienced million of growth in our investment income that was driven by higher investment balances as a result of the ipo and operational cash flow and an increase in investment yield 
our combined ratio also improved from in to in the primary reason for the combined ratio improvement was the decrease in amount of re estimation of prior accident years loss and loss expense reserves that negatively impacted our pre tax results by million in compared to million in offset by an increase in the current accident year loss and loss expenses 
as of december   our current accident year loss and loss expense ratios for accident years and were and  respectively  and reflect the overall rate declines experienced in the overall expense ratio declined from in to in this decrease in expense ratio is directly attributable to the company s cost containment efforts that began in the fourth quarter of revenues premiums premiums include insurance premiums underwritten by century which are referred to as direct premiums and insurance premiums assumed from other insurers generally in states where century is not licensed which are referred to as assumed premiums 
we refer to direct and assumed premiums together as gross premiums 
written premiums are the total amount of premiums billed to the policyholder less the amount of premiums returned  generally as a result of cancellations  during a given period 
written premiums become premiums earned as the policy ages 
barring premium changes  if an insurance company writes the same mix of business each year  written premiums and premiums earned will be equal  and the unearned premium reserve will remain constant 
during periods of growth  the unearned premium reserve will increase  causing premiums earned to be less than written premiums 
conversely  during periods of decline  the unearned premium reserve will decrease  causing premiums earned to be greater than written premiums 
we have historically relied on quota share  excess of loss  and catastrophe reinsurance primarily to manage our regulatory capital requirements and also to limit our exposure to loss 
generally  we have ceded a significant portion of our premiums to unaffiliated reinsurers in order to maintain a net written premiums to statutory surplus ratio of less than to our underwriting business is currently divided into two primary segments property casualty  and other including exited lines 

table of contents our property casualty segment primarily includes general liability  commercial property and multi peril insurance for small and mid sized businesses 
the other including exited lines segment primarily includes our surety business  including landfill and specialty surety that is written in order to maintain century s us treasury listing  workers compensation  which was exited in january  and commercial auto trucking  which was exited in may the following table presents our gross written premiums in our primary segments and provides a summary of gross  ceded and net written premiums and net premiums earned for the periods indicated 
years ended december  in thousands gross written premiums property casualty other including exited lines total gross written premiums ceded written premiums net written premiums net premiums earned net written premiums to gross written premiums net premiums earned to net written premiums net writings ratio  including discontinued operations the ratio of net written premiums including discontinued operations to our insurance subsidiaries combined statutory surplus 
this ratio is not restated to exclude discontinued operations as the insurance subsidiaries combined statutory surplus is not allocated by line of business 
therefore  in computing the ratio of net written premiums to our insurance subsidiaries combined statutory surplus we did not restate the net written premium for discontinued operations to be consistent with that of the subsidiaries combined statutory surplus 
management believes this measure is useful in gauging our exposure to pricing errors in the current book of business 
it may not be comparable to the definition of net writings ratio used by other companies 
gross written premiums year ended december  compared to year ended december  gross written premiums increased million or for the year ended december  compared to the same period in this increase was due primarily to increased business in our property casualty segment which increased million or 
the growth in the property casualty segment resulted principally from an increase in volume in our casualty lines of business of million or

these improvements include hiring additional staff  weekly monitoring of account aging and improved communication with our agents 
due to these improvements we significantly lowered our aged amount  which allowed us to maintain a lower provision for uncollectible accounts despite higher amounts of gross receivables 
we evaluate the collectibility of our agents balances both individually and on an aggregate basis 
in the event that we determine that an individual agent balance is in question  we will record a provision in part or in whole for that agent s balance 
on an aggregate basis  we evaluate historical write offs and premium growth rates to determine a general allowance 
net investment income our investment portfolio generally consists of liquid  readily marketable and investment grade fixed maturity and equity securities 
net investment income is primarily comprised of interest and dividend earned on these securities  net of related investment expenses 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net investment income increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in the increase was the result of higher investments and cash balances  as well as higher investment yields 
due to an increase in our operating cash flows  the investment portfolio and cash increased to million as of december   which is an increase of million from december  our average investment yield for was  compared to for the same period in on a tax equivalent yield basis  our yield increased to in compared to in year ended december  compared to year ended december  net investment income increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in the increase was due primarily to an increase in investments and cash  which was

we establish or adjust for prior accident quarters our best estimate of the ultimate incurred losses and loss expenses to reflect loss development information and trends that have been updated for the most recent quarter s activity through quarterly internal actuarial analysis 
as of december of each year  we have an independent actuarial analysis performed of the adequacy of our reserves 
our estimate of ultimate loss and loss expenses is evaluated and re evaluated by accident year and by major coverage grouping and changes in estimates are reflected in the period the additional information becomes known 
our reinsurance program significantly influences our net retained losses 
in exchange for premiums ceded to reinsurers under quota share and excess of loss reinsurance agreements  our reinsurers assume a portion of the losses and loss expenses incurred 
see business reinsurance 
we remain obligated for amounts ceded in the event that the reinsurers do not meet their obligations under the agreements due to  for example  disputes with the reinsurer or the reinsurer s insolvency

our changes in the reserve estimates related to prior accident years for the years ended december   and for the casualty lines resulted in increases in incurred losses and loss expenses of million  million  and million respectively 
a significant portion of our casualty reserves development relate to construction defect claims in certain states 
see business general 
starting with california in december  we began to exit contractors liability business written on an occurrence form 
by the end of the first quarter of  we had significantly reduced our contractors liability written on an occurrence form underwriting in all states  and completely eliminated contractors liability written on an occurrence form in arizona  california  colorado  hawaii  louisiana  nevada  new jersey  north carolina  oregon  south carolina and washington 
reserves and claim frequency on this business may be impacted by decisions by california and other states courts affecting insurance law and tort law 
they may also be impacted by legislation enacted in california 
this legislation continues to impact claim severity  frequency and time to settlement assumptions underlying our reserves 
accordingly  our ultimate liability may exceed or be less than current estimates due to this variable  among others 
during  as a result of court decisions that further defined the legal environment in california  the company decided to enhance its defense strategy in for certain types of construction defect claims 
as a result  the company revised the construction defect defense team by retaining appellate and new trial counsel and restaffing the in house team responsible for management of the litigation 
once the new legal teams were established late in and into  it was determined that there were certain cases that should be settled and the defense budgets for the remaining cases had to be revised to reflect the added resources  resulting in higher than expected loss and defense costs in during  the company s newly reported construction defect claims were greater than expected as of december  based on the company s experience during and industry information  the company substantially increased its projected ultimate construction defect claim count as of december  
table of contents during  the company s newly reported construction defect claims were greater than expected as of december  based on the company s experience during and industry information  the company substantially increased its projected ultimate construction defect claim count as of december  of our construction defect net loss and loss expense reserves at december   was for incurred but not reported losses which are referred to as ibnr and of our construction defect net loss and loss expense reserves at december  was for ibnr 
as of december   we had open claims relating to construction defects  compared to open claims as of december  during  new claims were reported and existing claims were settled or dismissed 
our net loss and loss expense reserves for construction defects as of december  were million 
the re estimation of construction defect reserves primarily affected the and accident years and the to accident years

our net loss and loss expense reserves for construction defects as of december  were million 
the re estimation of construction defect reserves primarily affected the and accident years and the to accident years 
in addition  we have also experienced development above expectations on our non construction defect casualty reserves for the to accident years that led to reassessments of the initial loss ratio expectations and the claim reporting and settlement patterns 
as of december   the projected loss and loss expense ratios  after the effects of reinsurance  for the casualty lines were  and for accident periods   and  respectively 
our internal actuaries generally apply actuarial techniques in the analysis of loss and loss expense reserves using the following factors  among others our experience and the industry s experience  historical trends in reserving patterns and loss payments  the impact of claim inflation  the pending level of unpaid claims  the cost of claim settlements  the line of business mix  and the environment in which property and casualty insurance companies operate 
although many factors influence the actual cost of claims and our corresponding reserve estimates  we do not measure and estimate values for all of these variables individually 
this is due to the fact that many of the factors that are known to impact the cost of claims cannot be measured directly  such as the impact on claim costs due to economic inflation  coverage interpretations and jury determinations 
in most instances  we rely on our historical experience or industry information to estimate values for the variables that are explicitly used in our reserve analyses 
we assume that the historical effect of these unmeasured factors  which is embedded in our experience or industry experience  is representative of future effects of these factors 
where we have reason to expect a change in the effect of one of these factors  we perform analysis to quantify the necessary adjustments 
for claim liabilities other than construction defect  our internal actuaries apply multiple traditional actuarial techniques to compute loss and loss expense reserve estimates 
each technique produces a unique loss and loss expense reserve estimate for the line being analyzed 
the set of techniques applied produces a 
table of contents range of loss and loss expense reserve estimates 
from these estimates  the actuaries form a best estimate which considers the assumptions and factors that influence ultimate claim costs  including but not limited to those identified above 
as of december   for casualty lines  other than construction defect claims  the low end of the range of techniques was below the actuarial best estimate  and the high end of the range of techniques was above the actuarial best estimate 
these low and high loss and loss expense reserve estimates reflect the fact that the methodologies applied do not produce identical estimates  and these estimates do not constitute the range of all possible outcomes 
it is important to note that actual claim costs will vary from the selected estimate  perhaps by substantial amounts  due to the inherent variability of the business written  the potentially significant claim settlement lags and the fact that not all events affecting future claim costs can be estimated at this time 
for construction defect claim liabilities  our internal actuaries apply one actuarial technique  under various sets of assumptions  which considers the factors that influence ultimate claim costs 
the actuarial technique for construction defect claim liabilities includes several variables relating to the number of ibnr claims and the average cost per ibnr claim 
in addition to computing best estimate parameter values for the actuarial projection  the actuaries also consider the impact on resulting ibnr related to reasonably foreseeable fluctuations in these variables  which is used to quantify a range of techniques of loss and loss expense reserves for construction defect 
as of december   for construction defect claims the low end of the range of techniques was below the actuarial best estimate and the high end of the range of techniques was above the actuarial best estimate 
these low and high loss and loss expense reserve estimates reflect the uncertainty in estimating the parameter values  and these estimates do not constitute the range of all possible outcomes 
it is important to note that actual claim costs will vary from the selected estimate  perhaps by substantial amounts  due to the inherent variability of these types of claims  the potentially significant claim settlement lags and the fact that not all events affecting future claim costs can be estimated at this time 
property 
our changes in reserve estimates for the years ended december   and for the property lines resulted in decreases increases of million  million and million  respectively 
these amounts primarily relate to changes in the selected development patterns on multiple accident years  as the number of claims and claim severity were below expectations at december  and and exceeded expectations at december  as of december   the projected loss and loss expense ratios  after the effects of reinsurance  for the property lines were  and for accident periods  and  respectively 
included in the accident year property loss ratio is related to the fall hurricane season 
our internal actuaries apply multiple actuarial techniques utilizing the same factors discussed above under casualty to compute loss and loss expense reserve estimates for property claim liabilities 
each technique produces a unique loss and loss expense reserve estimate for the line being analyzed 
the set of techniques applied produces a range of loss and loss expense reserve estimates 
from these estimates  the actuaries form a best estimate that considers assumptions and factors  as discussed above  that influence ultimate claim costs 
as of december   for property lines the low end of the range of techniques was below the actuarial best estimate and the high end of the range of techniques was above the actuarial best estimate 
these low and high loss and loss expense reserve estimates reflect the fact that the methodologies applied do not produce identical estimates  and these estimates do not constitute the range of all possible outcomes

income taxes we have historically filed a consolidated federal income tax return that has included all of our subsidiaries 
however  evergreen filed a separate federal income tax return in the statutory rate used in calculating our tax provision was in  and income tax expense benefit differed from the amounts computed at the statutory rate as demonstrated in the following table years ended december  federal income tax expense at statutory rate decrease increase attributable to nontaxable interest income dividend received deduction net of proration difference between the book and tax basis of evergreen other nontaxable income other total liquidity and capital resources procentury is a holding company  the principal asset of which is the common shares of century 
although we have the capacity to generate cash through loans from banks and issuances of equity securities  our primary source of funds to meet our short term liquidity needs  including the payment of dividends to our shareholders and corporate expenses  is dividends from century 
century s principal sources of funds are underwriting operations  investment income and proceeds from sales and maturities of investments 
century s primary use of funds is to pay claims and operating expenses  to purchase investments and to make dividend payments to us 
procentury s future liquidity is dependent on the ability of century to pay dividends 

table of contents century is restricted by statute as to the amount of dividends it may pay without the prior approval of regulatory authorities 
century may pay dividends to procentury without advance regulatory approval only from unassigned surplus and only to the extent that all dividends in the current twelve months do not exceed the greater of of total statutory surplus as of the end of the prior fiscal year or statutory net income for the prior year 
using these criteria  the available ordinary dividend payable by century to procentury during is million 
century paid ordinary dividends of million in  million in  and million in in addition  century paid million of extraordinary dividend in related to the dividend distribution of evergreen 
century s ability to pay future dividends to procentury without advance regulatory approval is dependent upon maintaining a positive level of unassigned surplus  which in turn  is dependent upon century generating net income in excess of dividends to procentury 
century is required by law to maintain a certain minimum level of surplus on a statutory basis 
surplus is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from total admitted assets 
the national association of insurance commissioners naic has a risk based capital standard designed to identify property and casualty insurers that may be inadequately capitalized based on inherent risks of each insurer s assets and liabilities and its mix of net written premiums 
insurers falling below a calculated threshold may be subject to varying degrees of regulatory action 
as of december   the statutory surplus of century was in excess of the prescribed risk based capital requirements that correspond to any level of regulatory action 
century s statutory surplus at december  was million and the authorized control level was million 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  consolidated net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily attributable to the decrease in receivable from subsidiary available for sale that was received in no such amounts were received in net cash used by investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the net cash used by investing activities was higher in because the proceeds from the ipo were used to purchase fixed maturities and equity securities 
net cash used by financing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million for the year ended december  this fluctuation was attributable to the proceeds from the issuance of common shares related to the ipo  which was partially offset by the redemption of class b shares and principal payment on long term debt in year ended december  compared to year ended december  consolidated net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to the increase in our total premium and investment income growth and payments received from evergreen and continental related to the settlement of the termination of the intercompany pooling agreement and the loss portfolio transfers during net cash used by investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to the proceeds from the ipo and improved operating cash flows noted above that were used to purchase fixed maturities and equity securities

the timing for payment of our estimated losses  net of the effects of reinsurance is determined by periods based on our historical claims payment experience 
due to the uncertainty in estimating the timing of such payments  there is a risk that the amounts paid in any period can be significantly different than the amounts disclosed above 
line of credit 
procentury has a million line of credit 
interest on the note is payable quarterly and is based on a floating rate of libor plus 
the note matures on september  under the terms of the line of credit  of the common shares of century are pledged as collateral 
in april  we made a million draw on the line of credit for general corporate purposes 
the million draw was paid off on may  interest paid on the line of credit was  due to the late filing of the quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended june   we became non compliant with the debt covenants in its line of credit 
on september   we received a waiver from the bank and now have the ability to draw on the line of credit 
we do not have any borrowings outstanding under the line of credit at december  reserve guarantee 
in conjunction with the investment in evergreen by certain waste companies  century entered into agreements with the investors pursuant to which century guaranteed that a evergreen s loss reserves including claim reserves  contingent commissions and unrecoverable reinsurance balances as of the date of the investment will be adequate to pay evergreen s actual losses incurred prior to that date and b that evergreen s net unearned premiums for business in force  as reflected in evergreen s balance sheet at that date  will not run off at more than a combined ratio 
an estimate of these guarantees was made and a reserve for  is reflected as an other operating expense in the accompanying audited consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  in  this agreement was assumed by evergreen 
given our historical cash flow  we believe cash flow from operating activities in will provide sufficient liquidity for our operations  as well as to satisfy debt service obligations and to pay other operating expenses 
although we anticipate that we will be able to meet our cash requirements  we can give no assurance in this regard 

table of contents investment portfolio our investment strategy is designed to capitalize on our ability to generate positive cash flow from our underwriting activities 
preservation of capital is our first priority  with a secondary focus on maximizing appropriate risk adjusted return 
we seek to maintain sufficient liquidity from operations  investing and financing activities to meet our anticipated insurance obligations and operating and capital expenditure needs 
the majority of our fixed maturity portfolio is rated investment grade to protect investments 
our investment portfolio is managed by three outside independent investment managers that operate under investment guidelines approved by century s investment committee 
century s investment committee meets at least quarterly and reports to procentury s board of directors 
in addition  we employ stringent diversification rules and balance our investment credit risk and related underwriting risks to minimize total potential exposure to any one security 
in limited circumstances  we will invest in non investment grade fixed maturity securities that have an appropriate risk adjusted return  subject to satisfactory credit analysis performed by us and our investment managers

of these securities  were rated aa or better and were rated aaa by standard poor s or the equivalent rating by moody s 
these securities are publicly registered and had fair values obtained from independent pricing services 
changes in estimated cash flows due to changes in prepayment assumptions from the original purchase assumptions are revised based on current interest rates and the economic environment 
we had no derivative financial instruments  real estate or mortgages in the investment portfolio at december  under our accounting policy for equity securities and fixed maturity securities an impairment is deemed to be other than temporary unless we have both the ability and intent to hold the investment for a reasonable period until the security s forecasted recovery and evidence exists indicating that recovery will occur within a reasonable period of time 
for other fixed maturity and equity securities  an other than temporary impairment charge is taken when we do not have the ability and intent to hold the security until the forecasted recovery or if it is no longer probable that we will recover all amounts due under the contractual terms of the security 
many criteria are considered during this process including  but not limited to  the current fair value as compared to amortized cost or cost  as appropriate  of the security  the amount and length of time a security s fair value has been below amortized cost or cost  specific credit issues and financial prospects related to the issuer  our intent to hold or dispose of the security  and current economic conditions 
additionally  for certain securitized financial assets with contractual cash flows including asset backed securities  fasb emerging task force eitf  recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased and retained beneficial interests in securitized financial assets  requires the company to periodically update its best estimate of cash flows over the life of the security 
if management determines that the fair value of a securitized financial asset is less than its carrying amount and there has been a decrease in the present value of the estimated cash flows since the last revised estimate  considering both timing and amount  then an other than temporary impairment is recognized 
other than temporary impairment losses result in a permanent reduction to the cost basis of the underlying investment 
for the year ended december   two fixed maturity securities were written down in the aggregate amount of  which was included as a realized loss in the consolidated statement of operations 
no other than temporary declines were realized in the year ended december  for the year ended december  one fixed maturity security was written down in the amount of  which was included as a realized loss in the consolidated statement of operations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential economic loss principally arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
the major components of market risk affecting us are credit risk  equity price risk and interest rate risk 

table of contents credit risk 
credit risk is the potential economic loss principally arising from adverse changes in the financial condition of a specific debt issuer 
we attempt to address this risk by investing in fixed maturity securities that are either investment grade  which are those bonds rated bbb or higher by standard poor s or securities that although not investment grade  meet our credit requirements and targeted risk adjusted return 
we also independently and through our outside independent investment managers  monitor the financial condition of all of the issuers of fixed maturity securities in our portfolio 
we utilize a rating change report  a rating watch report and a focus list as part of this process 
finally  we employ stringent diversification rules that limit our credit exposure to any single issuer 
equity price risk 
equity price risk is the potential that we will incur economic loss due to decline in common stock prices 
we attempt to manage this risk by focusing on a long term  conservative  value oriented  dividend driven investment philosophy for our equity portfolio 
the equity securities in our portfolio are primarily mid to large capitalization issues with strong dividend performance 
our strategy remains one of value investing  with security selection taking precedence over market timing 
we also employ stringent diversification rules that limit our exposure to any individual stock 
interest rate risk 
we had fixed maturity  preferred shares and bond mutual fund investments with a fair value of million at december  that are subject to interest rate risk 
we attempt to manage our exposure to interest rate risk through a disciplined asset liability matching and capital management process 
in the management of this risk  the characteristics of duration  credit and variability of cash flows are critical elements 
these risks are assessed regularly and balanced within the context of our liability and capital position 
the table below summarizes our interest rate risk 
it illustrates the sensitivity of the fair value of fixed maturity  preferred share and bond mutual fund investments to selected hypothetical changes in interest rates at december  the selected scenarios are not predictions of future events  but rather illustrate the effect that such events may have on the fair value of the fixed maturity  preferred share and bond mutual fund portfolio and shareholders equity
