item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
part i item business overview we design  develop and market a broad line of reprogrammable non volatile memory products and analog mixed signal products 
our products are used by manufacturers of electronic products in a wide range of consumer  computing  communications  industrial and automotive applications 
we focus on high volume markets for our cost effective  high quality products 
we have been a committed long term supplier of memory products for the past two decades even through periods of tight manufacturing capacity and cyclical market downturns 
we are leveraging our extensive experience in high volume  reprogrammable memory products to develop complementary analog mixed signal products that offer our customers a more complete system solution 
we supply semiconductor products in high volumes to our diverse customer base of more than  customers and shipped approximately million units on average in each of the last four fiscal quarters 
we outsource the fabrication of our products to third party foundries for a high quality  efficient and long term supply of our products 
we focus our internal efforts on product design  testing  marketing and sales 
we have strengthened and expanded the expertise of our research and development team by establishing our own engineering center in bucharest  romania and by hiring additional experienced engineers in romania and in our sunnyvale  california headquarters

industry background semiconductor devices may be divided into three broad categories analog  digital and mixed signal 
analog products monitor and manipulate real world signals such as sound  light  pressure  motion  temperature and electrical current 
digital circuits  such as microprocessors  use threshold voltages which function as on and off switches  which are expressed in binary code as ones and zeros 
the digital components process and manipulate the data while the analog components condition the inputs or signals 
mixed signal devices incorporate both analog and digital functions into a single semiconductor device 
in most cases  these mixed signal devices convert analog signals to digital signals or vice versa  or these devices may be used to improve the performance of the specific analog application 
non volatile memory devices require certain building blocks that have analog characteristics included within them in order to perform their memory functions 
non volatile memory products the principal distinguishing characteristic of non volatile memory is that it does not require a continuous application of power to retain data while volatile memory  such as dynamic random access memory  or dram  requires continuous power 
while non volatile memory products are often considered digital semiconductor devices  these non volatile memory devices incorporate certain high performance analog blocks 
electronic systems primarily use non volatile memory to store critical data when the power to the system is turned off 
virtually all electronic systems that use a digital processor or controller  including personal computers  printers  cellular handsets  digital cameras  optical networks  wireless local area networks  digital set top boxes and automotive systems  incorporate non volatile memory products such as electrically erasable programmable read only memory  or eeprom  and or flash memory 
many electronic systems utilize a combination of volatile and non volatile memory 
system manufacturers generally prefer non volatile memory devices that can be reprogrammed efficiently in the system in order to achieve several important advantages in comparison to non volatile memory devices that are not reprogrammable or which require physical removal for reprogramming 
with reprogrammable memory  manufacturers can cost effectively change program codes in response to accelerated product cycles and changing market specifications 
reprogrammable memory greatly simplifies inventory management and manufacturing processes and allows the manufacturer to reconfigure or update a system either locally or remotely through a network connection 
in addition  consumers use non volatile memory devices that can be programmed and reprogrammed to store user selected system configurations in consumer electronics devices  such as phone numbers in mobile telephones 
major non volatile memory classifications include eeprom and flash 
eeprom provides significant programming flexibility to system designers 
this non volatile memory can be erased and reprogrammed electrically within the system hundreds of thousands to millions of times and can be altered one byte or several bytes at a time 
in an eeprom device  each cell  which is the discrete area on the device in which one bit is stored  consists of two transistors  one to store data and one to permit the cell to be selected when erasing data 
serial eeprom transmits data through a single input output port while parallel eeprom transmits data through multiple input output ports concurrently 
flash memory provides significant programming flexibility to system designers at a higher density than eeprom 
although flash memory can be reprogrammed electrically within the system  the number of reprogramming cycles is generally less than eeprom and only a memory block can be rewritten  not an individual byte 
in flash memory  a block consists of an array of memory cells 
flash memory products can be manufactured with storage densities  transfer rates and data alterability comparable to dram and can achieve a relatively low manufacturing cost at higher densities 
for low density memory used in high volume applications  flash memory is not cost effective relative to eeprom 
because of its limitations and cost at low densities  flash memory is not used in certain system critical applications 
the eeprom market is characterized by high unit volumes sold at relatively low per unit prices 
the eeprom market has a limited number of vendors 
each participant in the eeprom market has relatively weak pricing power because of interchangeability of available vendors parts 
eeprom prices are largely a function of the demand for electronic devices in which they are incorporated  available memory manufacturing capacity  product availability and memory density 
in light of these competitive dynamics  some suppliers have exited the eeprom market  leaving fewer alternatives for original equipment manufacturer  or oem  customers 
manufacturers customarily use flash memory and eeprom to address different needs but often within the same electronic system 
since most consumer and industrial electronic devices continue to use eeprom either separately or in conjunction with other memory  oem customers want to develop relationships with memory vendors who are likely to be long term vendors of eeprom and those vendors which are developing and supplying a broad range of products 
analog mixed signal products the analog mixed signal market is generally divided into two major product categories depending on how the devices are used by system designers general purpose analog mixed signal products for standard designs  and analog mixed signal application specific standard products  or assps  for customized designs 
general purpose analog mixed signal products that perform a given function usually are interchangeable with standard components from another supplier 
similarly  in the memory market  most non volatile memory components are general purpose or industry standard parts and are interchangeable with parts from other suppliers 
general purpose analog mixed signal products include power management products  which control and regulate the amount of power delivered to an electronic system 
power management products are critical to overall system performance and cost 
these products include direct current to direct current  or dc to dc  converters  switching regulators  low drop out voltage regulators and voltage references 
suppliers of power management products are increasingly integrating discrete power management components into multi function devices to reduce design time and lower system costs by consuming less board space and power 
assps are a superior solution for systems that have special requirements  such as portability  size constraints or functionality 
the relationship between customer and supplier tends to be more dynamic and intertwined in this market with greater reliance on each other 
on one hand  the customer has to have enough trust in the supplier to take the risk of committing its supply chain to a single vendor 
on the other hand  the supplier faces the risk of investing significant research and development resources to design and develop a customized solution with the uncertainty of the market acceptance of the customer s end product 
suppliers servicing the assp market typically have greater pricing power and receive higher margins 
the analog mixed signal market is highly fragmented into many segments with numerous vendors serving one or more of the various segments 
the general purpose analog mixed signal semiconductor market is characterized by long product cycles with a broad  diverse base of customers 
as a result  general purpose analog mixed signal product prices tend to be more stable than those for non volatile memory products 
our competitive strengths we have two decades of experience in the design  testing and sale of reprogrammable non volatile memory products  including eeprom and low density flash 
we believe we have established a brand name that our oem and distribution customers associate with cost effective  high quality and high value products supported by excellent customer service 
these strengths have helped us grow in the competitive non volatile memory market 
on april   we completed our eighth consecutive fiscal year of profitability 
we intend to leverage our oem customer base and the design and operational expertise developed in our non volatile memory products to increase our revenues from our non volatile memory and analog mixed signal product offerings 
we believe the following are our key competitive strengths high quality design 
we have invested and intend to continue to invest substantial resources in research and development to improve our memory and analog mixed signal products 
to complement our sunnyvale  california engineering capabilities  in  we established our own design and development center in bucharest  romania 
we previously used contract personnel in romania but now have an integrated design organization  which currently includes a total of engineers 
through the development of our eeprom products  we also routinely design and develop high performance analog and mixed signal functions for use in our non volatile memory products 
as a result  our design personnel have extensive experience in designing analog blocks  which we believe will enable us to expand our focus to include the complementary analog mixed signal product market 
expertise in high volume  efficient manufacturing 
the markets for our non volatile memory products are characterized by high unit volumes sold at competitive prices 
to reduce cost  we are developing successive generations of our memory products scaled to smaller process geometries which is intended to result in reduced die sizes and lower cost per unit 
we conduct the majority of our wafer testing operations in our sunnyvale  california headquarters and take other steps to maintain and improve the quality of our products 
these efforts have improved the yield on our products 
we use third party contractors for a majority of our manufacturing  packaging  testing and shipping activities in order to control our costs and to be able to respond quickly to customer requests 
long term  established foundry relationships 
we have worked with our primary foundry supplier located in japan for more than years 
this long standing foundry relationship has enabled us to optimize our designs for its high volume and high yield processes 
to reduce our reliance on a single wafer foundry  we also developed our processes so that different fabrication facilities could replicate them 
we purchase volume shipments of our products from a united states based foundry  which currently produces most of our analog mixed signal products and can act as a second fabrication facility for some of our non volatile memory products 
we also regularly evaluate other foundries that may support the production of a broad range of high performance analog mixed signal products for us 
comprehensive eeprom product line 
we believe that we offer one of the most comprehensive lines of serial and parallel eeprom products in the industry 
our eeprom products support industry requirements and are available in a broad selection of densities and voltages 
our eeprom product line includes a wide array of performance characteristics which electronic system manufacturers need  such as interfaces  memory densities  voltages and bus speeds 
systems focused analog mixed signal product line 
we have concentrated our analog mixed signal product development and systems understanding on specific applications such as white light emitting diodes  or led  backlight drivers for liquid crystal display  or lcd  screens and modules  multi colored lcd applications such as automotive and aircraft interior lighting and instrumentation clusters  and on the portable power management functions that complement the led driver applications 
we believe that this focus enables us to achieve the necessary systems insight more rapidly in order to gain the confidence of  and secure the business of  major oems 
diverse end markets and applications 
through direct and indirect sales channels  we sell our products in a variety of end markets  including consumer  computing  communications  industrial and automotive 
our solutions are used in a broad array of applications within each of these markets  such as automotive systems  cordless telephones  digital cameras  digital video players  digital set top boxes  mobile phones  optical networks  personal computers and wireless local area networks 
due to the diversity of our markets and applications  we are not dependent on any individual industry or end user product 
in addition  we believe we have the opportunity to take advantage of the markets and growth in any of the industries we serve 
strong customer base 
we are one of the largest suppliers of eeprom in the world and we have relationships with many customers including large oems through direct sales  distributors and resellers 
during fiscal  we served more than  customers 
through our collaborations with oem customers in an interactive product design and development process  we have established durable relationships  solidified our customer base and defined the next generation of our products 
consequently  we believe that we are well positioned to continue to sell our existing and future analog mixed signal products to these customers  which could use many of these products in conjunction with our memory products 
our strategy we intend to continue to provide our customers with a reliable source of industry standard non volatile memory products 
we also intend to further improve our non volatile memory products and become a systems knowledgeable partner to our customers by providing a broad range of standard and custom analog mixed signal products 
our strategy includes the following strengthen eeprom product offering 
we intend to continue to develop high performance eeprom products and reduce our costs by continuing to migrate to smaller process geometries 
we intend to continue to provide high quality  competitively priced products with a broad range of densities and voltages 
as a result  we intend to strengthen our position in the eeprom market 
broaden standard analog mixed signal product offerings 
we have developed a range of industry standard analog mixed signal products that serve high volume markets 
leveraging our large oem customer base and efficient  high volume manufacturing process  we intend to become a reliable  high volume  cost effective supplier of standard analog mixed signal products to existing and new oem customers 
we intend to continue to introduce additional industry standard analog mixed signal products to increase net revenues  address new applications and increase our portfolio of analog building blocks for internal reuse in other products  such as application specific analog mixed signal products 
we reuse proven design blocks  which enables us to reduce the design and manufacturing risks associated with new products and assists us in reducing development times and in achieving higher reliability and manufacturing yields 
expand proprietary analog mixed signal product offerings 
we have introduced a range of proprietary analog mixed signal products  which often integrate analog elements with reprogrammable non volatile memory  such as digital potentiometer products  or dpps  and processor supervisors 
we intend to continue to introduce additional embedded memory products and to leverage our non volatile memory and analog design expertise 
we intend to continue to have these products built for us by our foundry suppliers using our proprietary process technology and open source technology  which supports both analog and non volatile memory elements in a single manufacturing process 
some of our non volatile memory customers  who include industry leading oems  are also beginning to purchase our standard analog products 
we are now working with selected customers to develop more highly integrated  high value added products customized for specific applications 
we are targeting selected applications in large segments  such as solid state illumination  which is lighting for displays  consumer electronic devices  automotive and other purposes 
we intend to implement our strategies by leveraging our design portfolio and ongoing research and development activities  expanding engineering resources in low cost areas  such as our bucharest  romania engineering center  expanding our design portfolio and making selective acquisitions of complementary companies or technologies  using third party foundries to provide wafer fabrication for our products  developing our processes in a manner that permits the manufacture of our products in the fabrication facilities of different semiconductor foundries  and taking advantage of the flexible capacity and lower fixed costs of the outsourced manufacturing model 
products we use our expertise in non volatile memory to develop and maintain a broad range of eeprom products and selected flash memory products 
in addition  we have expanded our focus to include analog mixed signal products 
parallel and serial eeprom we offer a broad range of serial eeprom products compatible with the three popular industry standard bus interface protocols the inter integrated circuit  or ic  bus interface of philips electronics nv  the microwire interface protocol of national semiconductor corporation and the serial peripheral interface  or spi  bus protocol of motorola  inc additionally  we offer four wire bus interface protocol type products  primarily for japanese customers 
we offer products in a wide variety of densities from kilobit  or kbit  to kbit  and voltage ranges from volts to volts 
serial eeprom products are used in many applications to store user reconfigurable data 
some of the more common applications are digital cameras  cell phones  digital video recorders  compact disc players  cordless phones  laser printers  memory modules for computers  disk drives  remote controls and various automotive applications 
we offer both standard volt and volt parallel eeprom  the latter of which meets most battery operated application requirements 
we offer products with a broad range of densities  such as kbit to kbit 
parallel eeprom provides faster transfer rates than serial eeprom  which transfers data through a single port 
because of the higher number of drivers and packaging  parallel eeprom is larger and more costly to manufacture than serial eeprom and  accordingly  is used primarily in high performance applications 
parallel eeprom is primarily used in applications such as point of sale terminals  industrial controllers  local area network adapters and telecommunication switches 
flash memory we currently offer flash memory in a small number of densities 
we offer intel licensed flash memory devices in densities ranging from kbit to megabit  or mb 
this family includes intel licensed boot block and bulk erase technologies available in mb and mb densities 
analog and mixed signal although analog mixed signal products constitute a relatively small portion of our net revenues  we believe that there is a substantial market opportunity for analog mixed signal products and have continued leveraging our design  development and sales skills to expand these product lines 
because applications for non volatile memory incorporate microcontrollers or microprocessors  many of the products interface with the controllers in various applications such as power management  systems supervision and interface support 
supervisory products with eeprom 
we have introduced a family of microcontroller supervisory products  which combine serial eeprom with the reset and watchdog functions required by many microcontrollers to ensure safe sustained operation and allow systems to recover more efficiently from power disruptions 
these products integrate two functions in the same semiconductor to provide savings in printed circuit board space and component costs 
our initial products are designed for use by the automotive industry and for power metering functions 
currently  we offer kbit  kbit  kbit and kbit of eeprom with embedded supervisory functions based on floating gate eeprom technology 
supervisory products without memory 
we have also introduced a family of multi industry supervisory products without eeprom memory 
digitally programmable potentiometers dpp 
we have introduced a number of solid state dpp products  which replace mechanical potentiometers used to fine tune and trim electronic circuitry in a variety of applications 
dpp products are built using the same processes as our eeprom products 
our dpp products have been included in interactive game consoles  digital cameras and optical transceivers 
white led drivers 
we have introduced several products intended to manage the white leds used as backlights in multi colored lcd screens in cell phones  digital cameras  mp music players  personal digital assistants  industrial instrumentation  automotive instrument clusters and home appliances 
color displays require more specialized led drivers than monochrome displays 
our products tightly regulate the current to the leds to ensure the uniform brightness and color purity necessary for the clarity in viewing the color displays 
dc to dc converters 
converting one direct current voltage to another within an electronic system is a common requirement  particularly in battery powered applications where the power available from the batteries will decline over time and use 
our designs allow smooth regulated operation of a system throughout the battery life 
our first generation of dc to dc converters is pin compatible with industry standard circuits 
all of the products described above are available in environmentally friendly packages  generally referred to as green packages 
sales and marketing the majority of our customers order our products through our manufacturers representatives  distributors and resellers 
these manufacturers representatives  distributors and resellers also create demand for our products  generally focusing on oem customers who are not directly served by our internal sales managers 
for example  our distributors sell to oem customers or those oems contract manufacturers 
in addition to our sales and marketing organization located in our sunnyvale  california headquarters facility  we have sales operations in east dundee  illinois  shanghai and shenzhen  china  oxford  united kingdom  munich  germany  yokohama  japan  singapore  seoul  south korea and taipei  taiwan 
our sales offices support oems and manufacturers representatives  distributors and resellers 
in addition  our japanese operation works closely with our japanese foundry partner  oem customers and their contract manufacturers  as well as our japanese manufacturers representatives  distributors and resellers 
currently  we have distributors and resellers in north and south america and a network of distributors and resellers throughout asia  europe and africa to support our international business 
these firms work with our regional sales managers in developing new opportunities  providing technical support and other value added services 
we often seek to develop strategic relationships with major oems and other customers by providing a high level of customer support and rapid problem solving 
our product knowledge includes a broad range of non volatile memory and analog and mixed signal technology compatible with the common industry standards 
we also seek to work closely with our customers to provide solutions to address an individual customer s needs 
our marketing activities consist of several key components targeted print advertising in local languages for trade  technical and business publications  online promotion on our website  developing with our distributors product evaluation boards that include two or more of the distributor s non competitive manufacturers thus allowing the distributor s own sales force to promote more than one supplier at a time  publishing application notes and journal articles to support the design in of analog mixed signal products  development of dedicated demonstration and evaluation boards to assist customer designers in evaluating our products in their systems  and conducting on site customer engineering training in analog mixed signal applications 
research and development we have made and expect to continue to make substantial investments in research and development and to participate in the development of new and existing industry standards 
as of april   our research and development staff consisted of engineers working in sunnyvale  california and bucharest  romania 
our memory engineering group develops non volatile memory products 
our analog mixed signal development group develops products with logic as well as analog circuitry contents 
we also routinely design and develop high performance analog and mixed signal functions using eeprom technology 
our technology development group develops advanced processes in cooperation with our foundries and also supports the design engineers with device modeling and characterization 
our computer aided design engineering group supports the design tools used by our design and layout engineers and converts the design data into mask shop usable format 
our test engineering group develops test programs for validating the electrical performance of our products in wafer and packaged form 
intellectual property we rely on a combination of patents  copyrights and trade secrets to establish and protect our intellectual property rights 
as of april   we owned us patents and have pending applications for additional us patents 
the expiration dates of our patents range from january to october as a result of the rapid changes in technology  the lives of these patents will likely last longer than the economic lives of the technologies they cover 
we also have a number of trademarks 
there can be no assurance that our pending patent or trademark applications will be allowed or that the issued or pending patents will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors 
we also protect our numerous original mask sets under us and foreign copyright laws 
we also own a substantial body of proprietary techniques and trade secrets 
we seek to protect our trade secrets and proprietary technology  in part  through confidentiality agreements with employees  consultants and other parties 
there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached  that we will have adequate remedies for any breach or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known to or independently developed by others 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not offer protection of our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states  which is an increasing concern as most of our production is located in foreign countries 
we may become involved in patent or other intellectual property disputes or actions 
from time to time  we receive letters alleging patent infringement or inviting us to take a license to other parties patents 
we evaluate these letters on a case by case basis 
offers such as these may lead to litigation if we reject the opportunity to obtain the license or reject the other party s demands 
adverse determinations in any litigation could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties  require us to seek licenses from third parties and prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products 
any of these situations could have a material adverse effect on our business 
manufacturing we have established close relationships with our foundry suppliers for our wafer fabrication in an effort to ensure stability in our supply of products and focus our internal efforts on product design and sales 
our designs are manufactured utilizing processes developed jointly by us and our foundry partners 
our japanese foundry supplier currently manufactures a majority of our high volume production 
our domestic foundry supplier currently manufactures most of our analog mixed signal products as well as some of our eeprom products 
we are also working with other foundries in asia to develop and manufacture additional analog mixed signal products 
we endeavor to develop our processes in a manner that permits the portability of our manufacturing processes 
we currently purchase wafer supplies on a purchase order basis 
we also maintain a die bank of wafers in order to be able to respond to customer orders quickly and to attempt to manage our exposure to changes in manufacturing capacity and wafer costs 
we have wafer sorting operations at our headquarters facility in sunnyvale  california to control quality and improve yields and we also utilize a subcontractor in japan for this purpose 
we perform circuit assembly and testing of packaged parts primarily through our subcontractors located in southeast asia 
in the assembly process  the wafers are separated into individual die  which are then assembled into packages 
the packaged devices are further tested and inspected pursuant to our quality assurance program prior to shipment to our customers 
the majority of our assembly and test services are provided by subcontractors located in thailand and in the philippines and  to a lesser degree  we also utilize assembly and test services provided by companies in malaysia  taiwan and china 
we also subcontract certain production planning  test engineering  inventory management  shipping and tape and reel activities to a subcontractor in thailand and are in the process of forming a subsidiary in thailand to perform a portion of the functions currently subcontracted 
competition the semiconductor industry is highly competitive and has been characterized by price competition  manufacturing capacity constraints and product availability constraints at various times 
we compete with major domestic and international semiconductor companies  many of which have substantially greater financial  technical  marketing  distribution and other resources 
our non volatile memory products  such as eeprom devices  compete on the basis of product performance  price  product availability and customer service 
we believe that we compete effectively with respect to each of these competitive factors 
price competition is significant and is expected to continue 
we believe our principal competitors for our eeprom products currently include atmel corporation  stmicroelectronics nv and microchip technology incorporated 
we also manufacture low density flash memory products  which represent a small subsegment of the flash memory market 
this subsegment has been characterized by reduced demand for low density memory  which has resulted in lower product availability and higher cost  due to the shift by most customers to the larger flash memory sizes that we do not offer 
our key competitors for low density or similar flash memory products include silicon storage technology  inc and integrated silicon solution  inc 
we currently compete in the analog mixed signal product market on the basis of product performance  product availability  price and customer support 
the analog and mixed signal industry is highly fragmented with competition varying with the applicable segment and subsegments  including fairchild semiconductor international  inc  intersil corporation  linear technology corporation  maxim integrated products  inc  national semiconductor and texas instruments incorporated

item a 
risk factors we are subject to a number of risks 
some of these risks are endemic to the high technology and semiconductor industry and are the same or similar to those disclosed in our previous sec filings 
the following lists some  but not all  of the risks and uncertainties which may have a material and adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
the risks and uncertainties set out below are not the only risks and uncertainties we face 
risks related to our business our quarterly operating results may fluctuate due to many factors and are difficult to forecast  which may cause the trading price of our common stock to decline substantially 
our operating results have historically been and in the future may be adversely affected or otherwise fluctuate due to factors such as fluctuations in customer demand for the electronic devices into which our products are incorporated  volatility in supply and demand affecting semiconductor prices generally  such as an increase in the supply of competitive products and a significant decline in average selling prices  establishment of additional inventory reserves if sales of our inventory fall below our expected sales  or the anticipated selling prices of our products fall below the amounts paid to produce and sell certain parts  changes in our product mix including product category  density  package type  lead content  or voltage  inadequate visibility of future demand for our products  timing of new product introductions and orders for our products  increases in expenses associated with new product introductions and promotions  process changes and or expansion of our sales channels  increases in wafer prices due to increased market demand and other factors  increases in prices charged by our suppliers due to increased costs  decreased competition and other factors  fluctuations in manufacturing yields  gains or losses of significant oem customers or indirect channel sellers  such as distributors or resellers  and general economic conditions 
our net revenues and operating results are difficult to forecast 
we base our expense levels  in significant part  on our expectations of future net revenues and our expenses are therefore relatively fixed in the short term 
if our net revenues fall below our forecasts  our operating results are likely to be disproportionately adversely affected because our costs are difficult to reduce significantly in the short term 
we may never realize a material portion of our net revenues from our analog mixed signal products  despite our expenditure of a disproportionate amount of our research and development and marketing resources on these products 
analog mixed signal products accounted for  and of net revenues for fiscal  and  respectively 
we believe that the growth in our analog mixed signal product revenues has been limited due to the extended product design cycles and production lead times  and a sales force that has limited experience selling these products 
despite limited product acceptance to date  we continue to invest in and devote research and development and marketing resources to analog mixed signal products with the expectation that our standard analog mixed signal products will be accepted by many of our current customers and that we will eventually qualify and sell custom analog mixed signal products 
competition is intense as we have initially offered a limited range of products while our more established competitors are offering a much broader array of analog mixed signal products 
many customers favor a vendor that offers a broad range of products 
if we are unable to realize more revenues from these products  our total revenues may not grow 
in addition  if we devote a disproportionate amount of our research and development resources to analog mixed signal products  our development of new non volatile memory products may suffer and operating results may be harmed 
we have in the past been unable and in the future we may be unable to obtain sufficient quantities of wafers from our current foundry suppliers to fulfill customer demand 
we currently purchase a majority of our production wafers from two foundries 
to address our wafer supply concerns  we plan to continue expanding our foundry capability at our primary supplier by qualifying our products in multiple fabrication plants owned by the supplier and to expand our foundry capacity with other suppliers 
as the need arises  from time to time  we may pursue additional wafer sources 
however  we cannot be certain that these efforts will provide us with access to adequate capacity in the future at costs which will enable us to remain profitable 
even if such capacity is available from another manufacturer  the qualification process and time required to make the foundry fully operational for us could take many months or longer and be subject to other factors described below and the prices could be materially higher 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the loss of any of our current foundries as a supplier  our inability to obtain additional capacity at our current foundry suppliers  our inability to qualify our current foundry suppliers for additional products  our inability to locate and qualify other wafer manufacturers for desired foundry capacity  or any other problems foundries may have causing a significant interruption in our supply of semiconductor wafers 
we are now required to expense share based payments to our employees  and our financial statements will have a significant material adverse charge 
as of may   we are required to expense stock options and other share based payments to employees and directors  which will require us to record a significant charge to earnings 
on december   the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
and supersedes apb opinion no 
sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be valued at fair value on the date of grant  and to be expensed over the requisite service period 
pro forma disclosure of the income statement effects of share based payments will no longer be an alternative 
we adopted sfas no 
r on may   the first day of our fiscal compensation expense for the unvested awards will be measured based on the fair value of the awards previously calculated in developing the pro forma disclosures in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
our pro forma stock compensation expense was million for fiscal adoption of this accounting standard will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements 
we are currently evaluating our stock based compensation programs to determine what our alternatives may be to reduce this expense in the future 
if we choose not to issue stock options at the levels we have in the past  we believe we may face more difficulties in attracting and retaining employees 
we depend on a small number of suppliers for our supply of wafers and we may be unable to meet customer demand due to our inability to obtain wafers 
we do not manufacture or process the semiconductor wafers used for our products 
in  we began a relationship with our principal foundry supplier 
since  that foundry has supplied wafers to us and has been our principal foundry source 
in fiscal  an additional foundry began to provide products to us 
we primarily use our principal foundry supplier for fabricating our memory products and our other foundry supplier for fabricating our analog mixed signal products 
we do not presently have a wafer supply agreement with our foundry suppliers and instead purchase wafers on a purchase order and acceptance basis 
our reliance on these independent foundries involves a number of risks  including inadequate wafer supplies to meet our production needs  increased prices charged by these independent foundries  reduced control over delivery schedules  manufacturing yields and costs  and any other circumstances causing a significant interruption in our supply of semiconductor wafers 
we may forecast incorrectly and produce excess or insufficient inventories of particular products  which may adversely affect our results of operations 
since we must order products and build inventory substantially in advance of product shipments  we may forecast incorrectly and produce excess or insufficient inventories of particular products 
the ability of our customers to reschedule or cancel orders without significant penalty could adversely affect our liquidity  as we may be unable to adjust our purchases from our wafer suppliers to match any customer changes and cancellations 
as part of our business strategy  we maintain a substantial inventory of sorted wafers in a die bank but limit our investment in finished goods 
we may have adequate wafer inventory to meet customer needs but may be unable to finish the manufacturing process prior to the delivery date specified by the customer 
demand for our products is volatile and customers often place orders with short lead times 
our inventory may not be reduced by the fulfillment of customer orders and in the future we may produce excess quantities of our products 
it is our policy to fully write down all inventories that we do not expect to be sold in a reasonable period of time 
during recent fiscal years  as a result of reductions in estimated demand for our various products  we have taken charges for write down of inventories for certain products  primarily our eeprom products 
for example  we recorded inventory write down charges of million  million and  in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively  which were partially offset by benefits of  million and million  relating to products that were written off in prior periods and sold during these fiscal years  respectively 
we may suffer reductions in values of our inventories in the future and we may be unable to liquidate our inventory at acceptable prices 
to the extent we have excess inventories of particular products  our operating results could be adversely affected by charges to cost of revenues that we would be required to recognize due to significant reductions in demand for our products or rapid declines in the market value of inventory  resulting in inventory write downs or other related factors 
we may be unable to fulfill all our customers orders according to the schedule originally requested due to the constraints in our wafer supply and processing time from die bank to finished goods  which could result in reduced revenues or higher expenses 
due to the lead time constraints in our wafer supply  foundry activities and other manufacturing processes  from time to time we have been unable to fulfill all our customers orders on the schedule originally requested 
although we attempt to anticipate pending orders and maintain an adequate supply of wafers and communicate to our customers delivery dates that we believe we can reasonably expect to meet  our customers may not accept the alternative delivery date or may cancel their outstanding orders 
reductions in orders received or cancellation of outstanding orders would result in lower net revenues and reduced operating results  excess inventories and increased inventory reserves 
we may also be required to pay substantially higher per wafer prices to replenish our die bank  which could harm our gross margins 
if we were requested to pay rush charges to our manufacturing or foundry suppliers to meet a customer s requested delivery date  our expenses would increase and possibly harm our operating results 
we rely on distributors and resellers for a substantial portion of our net revenues and if our relationships with one or more of those distributors or resellers were to terminate  our operating results may be harmed 
we market and distribute our products primarily through independent distributors and resellers  which typically offer competing products 
these distribution channels have been characterized by rapid change  including consolidations and financial difficulties 
distributors and resellers have accounted for a significant portion of our net revenues in the past 
for fiscal  sales to avnet  inc  an international distributor  represented of our net revenues 
for fiscal  none of our direct or indirect customers represented or more of our net revenues 
for fiscal  sales to alr company limited  a reseller in china  represented of our net revenues 
in addition  we have experienced and may continue to experience lower margins on sales to distributors and resellers as a result of volume pricing arrangements 
we also do not typically enter into long term arrangements with our distributors and resellers and we cannot be certain as to future order levels from our distributors and resellers 
when we do enter into long term arrangements  the contracts are generally terminable at the convenience of either party and it may be difficult to replace that source of revenues in the short term upon cancellation 
our business depends on these third parties to sell our products 
as a result  our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by the loss of one or more of our current distributors or resellers  additional volume pricing arrangements  order cancellations  delay in shipment by one of our distributors or resellers or the failure of our distributors or sellers to successfully sell our products 
we face risks from failures in our manufacturing processes and the processes of our foundries and vendors 
the fabrication of semiconductors  particularly eeprom products  is a highly complex and precise process 
most of our products are currently manufactured by two outside foundries and a number of other vendors participate in assembling  testing and other processing of our products 
during manufacturing  each wafer is processed to provide numerous eeprom  flash or analog mixed signal devices 
we may reject or be unable to sell a substantial percentage of wafers or the components on a given wafer because of minute impurities  difficulties in the fabrication process  such as failure of special equipment  operator error or power outages  defects in the masks used to imprint circuits on a wafer  nonconforming electrical and or optical performance  breakage of wafers  or other factors 
we refer to the proportion of final components that have been processed  assembled and tested relative to the gross number of components that could be constructed from the raw materials as our manufacturing yield 
we have in the past experienced lower than expected manufacturing yields  which have delayed product shipments and negatively impacted our results of operations 
we may experience difficulty maintaining acceptable manufacturing yields in the future 
in addition  the maintenance of our outsourced fabrication  manufacturing and assembly model is subject to risks  including the demands of managing and coordinating workflow between geographically separate production facilities  disruption of production in one facility as a result of a slowdown or shutdown in another facility  and higher operating costs from managing geographically separate manufacturing facilities 
we depend on certain vendors for foundry services  materials  test and assembly services 
we maintain stringent policies regarding qualification of these vendors 
however  if these vendors processes vary in reliability or quality  they could negatively affect our products and our results of operations 
we rely on third party subcontractors to sort  assemble  test and ship our products to customers  which reduces our control over quality  delivery schedules and capacity 
we outsource all or a portion of the production planning  assembly  test and finish work of our products  as well as our inventory management function to subcontractors who are primarily located in thailand and the philippines 
we do not have long term contractual arrangements with these subcontractors 
our reliance on third parties subjects us to risks such as reduced control over delivery schedules and quality  a potential lack of adequate capacity during periods when demand is high and potential increases in product costs due to factors outside our control such as capacity shortages and pricing changes 
our outsourcing model could lead to delays in product deliveries  lost sales and increased costs which could harm our relationships with oem customers and indirect sales channels and result in lower operating results 
because we utilize the services of a group of assembly and test providers  this makes our operation highly complex  requiring a high degree of diligence in managing the costs of production and overall logistics of our manufacturing operations 
while we believe that we currently have adequate internal control over financial reporting  we are exposed to risks from recent legislation requiring companies to evaluate internal control over financial reporting and cannot be certain that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective or sufficient in the future 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires our management to report on and our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
we have an ongoing program to perform the system and process evaluation and testing necessary to comply with these requirements 
it may be difficult to design and implement effective internal control over financial reporting for combined operations and differences in existing controls of acquired businesses may result in weaknesses that require remediation when internal control over financial reporting are combined 
for example  in fiscal we experienced unanticipated delays in closing our books and completing our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as required by the sarbanes oxley act under section as such  we were not able to file this annual report on form k by the original due date without unreasonable expense or effort 
our ability to manage our operations and growth will require us to improve our operations  financial and management controls  as well as our internal control over financial reporting 
we may not be able to implement improvements to our internal control over financial reporting in an efficient and timely manner and may discover deficiencies and weaknesses in existing systems and controls  especially when such systems and controls are tested by increased scale of growth 
as a result  we expect to continue to incur related expenses and to devote additional resources to section compliance 
in addition  it is difficult for us to predict how long it will take to complete the assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting each year and we may not be able to complete the process on a timely basis 
in the event that our chief executive officer  chief financial officer or independent registered public accounting firm determine that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective as defined under section  we cannot predict how regulators will react or how the market prices of our shares will be affected 
we expect to relocate our principal executive offices in august  and the transition of our principal executive offices may cause delays that may harm our future operating results our existing principal executive offices are located in sunnyvale  california 
our lease in the sunnyvale facility expires in july and will become a monthly rent obligation for the remainder of our occupancy 
in anticipation of the expiration of this lease  we began renovations of a new headquarters in april in a building we purchased in santa clara  california in march there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully transition all of our administrative operations to the new facility without incurring significant additional costs from extending our lease on a month to month basis for the sunnyvale facility or that we will not experience any delays in establishing the required infrastructure to operate the business effectively 
we may also experience network  telecommunications and other infrastructure disruptions in connection with our move to the new facility  which may limit our ability to complete sales and other transactions until the disruptions are resolved and would negatively affect our operating results 
the transition of administrative operations to the new facility could place significant strain on our management and engineering resources and result in diversion of management attention from the day to day operation of our business 
in addition  the customer and internal qualification of our wafer testing facilities at the santa clara location may not occur in a timely manner  if at all  which may increase our operating expenses and force us to operate two facilities until we successfully qualify the santa clara facility 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to hire additional management  engineering and other personnel  as needed  to manage effectively  the transition to the new facility  which may harm our future operating results 
international sales comprise a significant portion of our product sales  which exposes us to foreign political and economic risks 
for each of fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  sales outside the united states accounted for approximately of our net revenues 
we expect that sales outside of the united states will continue to represent a significant portion of our net revenues in the future 
however  our international operations may be adversely affected by the following factors greater fluctuations in demand for our products due to the increased sensitivity to pricing changes in certain markets  particularly asia  longer payment cycles  fluctuations in exchange rates  imposition of government controls  difficulties in staffing international operations  political  socioeconomic and financial instability  such as the military actions in afghanistan and iraq  trade restrictions  the impact of communicable diseases  such as severe acute respiratory syndrome  and changes in regulatory requirements 
our business is also subject to other risks because of our design center in romania and our relationships with foreign subcontractors including  but not limited to  foreign government regulations and political and financial unrest which may cause disruptions or delays in shipments to our customers or access to our inventories 
we do not currently hedge against any foreign currency exchange rate risks 
additionally  our subcontracted presence in thailand with trio tech subjects us to additional risks associated with the value of the work in process and finished goods inventory located there as well as the test equipment utilized in the operations at the trio tech facility 
we are in the process of forming a subsidiary in thailand that will hire personnel and own certain equipment located in that country in addition to our current operations 
we may face increased management costs and other risks due to the establishment of our product development group in romania 
in january  we formed a wholly owned subsidiary in romania to provide engineering services for current products and the development of potential new products 
in august  we purchased a building in bucharest for use by our romanian engineering group at a cost of million 
we have no prior experience in establishing or operating engineering services outside of our headquarters in sunnyvale  california 
the expansion of our engineering design operations to remotely situated offices presents a number of substantial risks that could increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our operating results  financial condition and ability to deliver our products and grow our business  including difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  in particular attracting and retaining personnel qualified to provide high quality engineering services  difficulties in coordinating our engineering operations in romania with those in california  diversion of management attention  political and economic instability  which may have an adverse impact on foreign exchange rates of the romanian leu relative to the us dollar and could impair our ability to conduct our business in romania  difficulties in maintaining uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies with our romanian subsidiary relative to those of our other locations  including product development management and financial consolidation  difficulties in owning and operating real property in romania  and inadequacy of the local infrastructure to support our needs 
our ability to operate successfully depends upon the continued service of certain key employees and the continued ability to attract and retain additional highly qualified personnel 
our ability to operate successfully will depend  to a large extent  upon the continued service of certain key employees and the continued ability to attract and retain additional highly qualified personnel 
competition for these personnel  particularly for highly skilled design  process and test engineers  is intense and we may not be able to retain these personnel or attract other highly qualified personnel 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the loss of or failure to attract and retain highly qualified personnel 
our low density flash memory products may become obsolete 
a significant portion of our net revenues have been and continue to be derived from sales of low density flash memory products 
flash memory products represented  and of our net revenues in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
in general  the market for flash memory products has been characterized by competing technologies  migration of demand to larger memory sizes and intense overall competition 
other flash memory vendors continue to design  develop and sell flash memory devices with larger memory in reaction to changes in market demand 
this transition to larger flash memory sizes is resulting in a limited and shrinking market for the low density flash memory products that we currently offer 
we have decided not to develop any of the higher density flash memory devices due to the extreme competition in the medium and high density flash memory market and the considerable costs of development associated with it 
due to these and other factors  we may experience declining net revenues from our low density flash memory products  which could harm our operating results 
risks related to our industry and competition competition in our markets may lead to reduced average selling prices of our products  reduced sales of our products or gross margins 
the non volatile memory market is competitive and has been characterized by rapid price erosion  manufacturing capacity constraints and limited product availability 
average selling prices in the non volatile memory market generally  and for our products in particular  have fluctuated significantly over the life of each product and  over the long term  the average selling price of each product has tended to decline 
declines in average selling prices for our products  if not offset by reductions in the cost of producing those products or by sales of new products with higher gross margins  would decrease our overall gross margins  could cause a negative adjustment to the value of our inventories and could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
we compete with major domestic and international semiconductor companies  many of which have substantially greater financial  technical  marketing  distribution and other resources 
we may not be able to compete successfully in the future 
our more mature products  such as serial and parallel eeprom devices  compete on the basis of price  product availability and customer service 
principal competitors for our eeprom products currently include atmel  stmicroelectronics and microchip technology 
principal competitors for our low density flash products include silicon storage technology and integrated silicon solution 
principal competitors for our analog mixed signal products include fairchild semiconductor  intersil  linear technology  maxim integrated products  national semiconductor and texas instruments 
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical in nature  which may cause our operating results to fluctuate 
we operate in a highly cyclical industry that has been subject to significant economic downturns often in connection with  or in anticipation of  maturing product cycles and declines in general economic conditions 
these types of downturns have occurred numerous times in the past  most recently  in calendar year during such downturns  we experience reduced product demand and production overcapacity which result in competitive pricing pressures leading to accelerated erosion of average selling prices and reduced gross margins 
these downturns may occur for extended periods 
accordingly  we may experience substantial period to period fluctuations in operating results 
our continued success depends in large part on the continued growth of various electronics industries that use semiconductors 
we attempt to identify changes in market conditions as soon as possible  however  market dynamics make our prediction of and timely reaction to such events difficult 
our business could be harmed in the future by additional cyclical downturns in the semiconductor industry or by slower growth by any of the markets served by our end customers products 
if our products fail to keep pace with the rapid changes in the semiconductor industry  we could lose customers and revenues 
the markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing customer demand  over or under utilization of manufacturing capacity and price fluctuations 
to compete successfully  we must introduce new products in a timely manner at competitive price  quality and performance levels 
in particular  our future success will depend on our ability to develop and implement new design and process technologies which enable us to reduce product costs 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by delays in developing new products  achievement of volume production and market acceptance of new products  successful completion of technology transitions of our existing products to new process geometries or foundries with acceptable yields and reliability 
risks related to our intellectual property our business may be harmed if we fail to protect our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of patents  trademarks  copyrights  trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property rights 
we currently have patents granted and pending in the united states and intend to seek further united states and international patents on our technology 
we cannot be certain that patents will be issued from any of our pending applications  that patents will be issued in all countries where our products can be sold or that any issued patents will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage 
our competitors may also be able to design around our patents 
the laws of some countries in which our products are or may be developed  manufactured or sold  may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states  increasing the possibility of piracy of our technology and products 
although we intend to vigorously defend our intellectual property rights  we may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our technology 
our competitors may also independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 
our ability to produce our products may suffer if someone claims we infringe on their intellectual property 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights or positions  which have resulted in significant and often protracted and expensive litigation 
in addition  it is typical for companies in the industry to receive notices from time to time that allege infringement of patents or other intellectual property rights 
we may receive other notices or become a party to other proceedings alleging our infringement of patents or intellectual property rights in the future 
if it is necessary or desirable  we may seek licenses under such patents or other intellectual property rights 
however  we cannot be certain that licenses will be offered or that we would find the terms of licenses that are offered acceptable or commercially reasonable 
our failure to obtain a license from a third party for technology used by us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to suspend the manufacture of the affected products 
furthermore  we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights 
litigation by or against us could result in significant expense and divert the efforts of our technical personnel and management  whether or not the litigation results in a favorable resolution 
in the event of an adverse result in any litigation  we could be required to pay substantial damages  pay amounts to indemnify our customers  stop the manufacture and sale of the infringing products  expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology  discontinue the use of certain processes  or obtain licenses to the technology 
we may be unsuccessful in developing non infringing products or negotiating licenses with reasonable terms  or at all 
these problems might not be resolved in time to avoid harming our results of operations 
if any third party makes a successful claim against our customers or us and a license is not made available to us on commercially reasonable terms  our business could be harmed 
we may be subject to damages resulting from claims that we have wrongfully used the alleged trade secrets of our employees former employers 
many of our employees were previously employed at other companies  including our competitors or potential competitors 
although we have no current or pending claims against us  we may be subject to claims that we have relied on information that these employees have inadvertently  or otherwise  disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers 
litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims 
if we fail in defending such claims  in addition to paying monetary damages  we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel 
a loss of key research personnel or their work product could hamper or prevent our ability to develop new products  which could severely harm our business 
even if we are successful  litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management 
we may not be able to expand our proprietary technology if we do not acquire rights to use key technologies  consummate potential acquisitions or investments or successfully integrate them with our business 
to expand our proprietary technologies  we may acquire or make investments in complementary businesses  technologies or products if appropriate opportunities arise 
we may be unable to identify suitable acquisition or investment candidates at reasonable prices or on reasonable terms or consummate transactions with such candidates  the failure of which could slow our growth 
we may also have difficulty in acquiring licenses to use proprietary technologies of third parties to expand our product lines 
we may have difficulty integrating the acquired products  personnel or technologies of any acquisition we might make 
these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business  limit our future growth  distract our management and employees and increase our expenses 
risks related to our stock our stock is subject to substantial price and volume fluctuations due to a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control  and those fluctuations may prevent our stockholders from reselling our common stock at a profit 
the trading price of our common stock has in the past been and could in the future be subject to significant fluctuations in response to quarterly variations in our results of operations  announcements of technological innovations or new products by us  our customers or competitors  our failure to achieve the operating results anticipated by analysts or investors  sales or the perception in the market of possible sales of a large number of shares of our common stock by our directors  officers  employees or principal stockholders  international political  socioeconomic and financial instability  including instability associated with military action in afghanistan  iraq or other conflicts  releases or reports by or changes in security analysts recommendations  and developments or disputes concerning patents or proprietary rights or other events 
for example  during fiscal  fiscal  fiscal and to date in fiscal  the trading price of our common stock on the nasdaq national market has ranged from a high of per share to a low of per share 
if our net revenues and results of operations are below the expectations of investors  significant fluctuations in the market price of our common stock could occur 
in addition  the securities markets have  from time to time  experienced significant price and volume fluctuations  which have particularly affected the market prices for high technology companies and often are unrelated and disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies 
these broad market fluctuations  as well as general economic  political and market conditions  may negatively affect the market price of our common stock 
our charter documents  delaware law and our stockholder rights plan contain provisions that may inhibit potential acquisition bids  which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock  discourage merger offers or prevent changes in our management 
our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions  including voting rights  of the shares without any further vote or action by our stockholders 
if we issue any of these shares of preferred stock in the future  the rights of shareholders of our common stock may be negatively affected 
if we issue preferred stock  a change of control of our company could be delayed  deferred or prevented 
we have no current plans to issue shares of preferred stock 
section of the delaware general corporation law restricts certain business combinations with any interested stockholder as defined by that statute 
in addition  our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain certain other provisions that may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change of control 
these provisions include the classification of our board so that only a portion of our directors are elected each year and each director serves a three year term  the elimination of actions by written consent of stockholders  and the establishment of an advance notice procedure and a minimum holding requirement for stockholder proposals and director nominations to be acted upon at annual meetings of the stockholders 
in  our board of directors adopted a stockholder rights plan with an initial term of ten years which will expire in december under this plan  we issued a dividend of one right for each share of our common stock 
each right initially entitles stockholders to purchase one one thousandth of a share of our preferred stock for 
however  the rights are not immediately exercisable 
if a person or group acquires  or announces a tender or exchange offer that would result in the acquisition of of our common stock  unless the rights are redeemed by us for per right  the rights will become exercisable by all rights holders  except the acquiring person or group  for shares of our common stock or the stock of the third party acquirer having a value of twice the right s then current exercise price 
these provisions are designed to encourage potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors and give our board of directors an opportunity to consider various alternatives to increase stockholder value 
these provisions are also intended to discourage certain tactics that may be used in proxy contests 
however  the potential issuance of preferred stock  our charter and bylaw provisions  the restrictions in section of the delaware general corporation law and our stockholder rights plan could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control  which may adversely affect the market price of our stock 
these provisions and plans may also have the effect of preventing changes in our management or board of directors 
we may be the subject of securities class action litigation due to future stock price volatility 
in the past  when the market price of a stock has been volatile  holders of that stock have often initiated securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock 
if any of our stockholders brought a lawsuit against us  we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit 
the lawsuit could also divert the time and attention of our management

overview we design  develop and market a broad line of reprogrammable non volatile memory products and analog mixed signal products 
our products are used by manufacturers of electronic products in a wide range of consumer  computing  communications  industrial and automotive applications 
we generally target high volume markets for our cost effective  high quality products 
we have been a committed long term supplier of memory products including through periods of tight manufacturing capacity and cyclical market downturns 
the market for our non volatile memory is highly competitive and market participants have relatively weak pricing power 
although our average selling prices of our non volatile memory products have declined over time  prices are sensitive to conditions in our oem customers target markets 
for example  in fiscal  we experienced a downward trend in average selling prices and unit volumes for our non volatile memory products due to weakening market demand  which continued in fiscal in general  we expect the average selling price for a given memory product to decline in the future  primarily due to market competition  product availability and manufacturing capacity 
in response to that trend  we continue to work with our foundries and other vendors to increase the manufacturing efficiency of our products 
we are leveraging our extensive experience in high volume  reprogrammable memory products to develop complementary analog mixed signal products that offer our customers a more complete system solution 
we have strengthened and expanded the expertise of our research and development team by establishing our own development center in bucharest  romania and by hiring additional engineers in romania and in our sunnyvale  california headquarters 
in fiscal  we purchased a building in santa clara  california that will house our principal offices and our principal wafer test operation  which are presently located in sunnyvale  california 
the move is expected to provide employees with modern facilities and make efficient use of space while reducing our occupancy costs 
in addition  in fiscal  we purchased a new building in bucharest for our romanian product development team 
we continue to make substantial investments in research and development to advance our non volatile memory products  as well as develop broader solutions with our line of analog mixed signal products 
we are in the process of forming a subsidiary in thailand that will perform a portion of the inventory management and processing functions that are currently subcontracted to trio tech 
this is expected to reduce our expenses and improve our control over the personnel and assets now located in thailand 
sales of our analog mixed signal products continue to trend upwards  reaching of net revenues in fiscal as compared to of net revenues in fiscal we expect net revenues from analog mixed signal products to comprise a larger portion of our net revenues in the future 
our business is less capital intensive than traditional semiconductor companies since we outsource to third parties the manufacturing  assembling and most of the testing of our products 
we strive to maintain long term relationships with our suppliers to ensure stability in our supply of products at a competitive cost 
in addition  in an effort to alleviate any potential wafer capacity constraints  we maintain a supply of wafers in a die bank for selected products 
we market and sell our products directly through our sales force and sales representatives to oems and indirectly through distributors and resellers who sell to their end customers 
indirect sales were a majority of our total net revenues in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  representing of net revenues in fiscal our total customer base  including oems and end customers of our distributors and resellers  is relatively diverse and during fiscal consisted of more than  customers 
we have approximately distributors and resellers 
in fiscal  one customer represented of our net revenues 
for fiscal  no one customer accounted for or more of our net revenues 
for fiscal  one customer represented of our net revenues 
our sales are initiated by purchase orders received from our customers and are typically shipped within a few weeks of receiving the order 
since industry practice allows customers to reschedule or cancel orders on relatively short notice  we do not use backlog to forecast our future net revenues 
cancellations of customer orders  distributor price protection and distributor stock rotation rights  all industry standards  could result in the loss of future net revenues without allowing us sufficient time to reduce our inventory and operating expenses 
sales to customers outside the united states comprised the of our net revenues for each of fiscal  fiscal and fiscal substantially all sales of our products are denominated in us dollars  minimizing the effects of foreign currency fluctuations 
our net revenues in fiscal benefited by approximately million from the termination of price adjustment and stock rotation rights of certain small regional resellers  which had not historically used those rights that resulted in recognition of revenue and gross margin for the inventories held by such resellers 
we did not have similar benefits in fiscal description of operating accounts net revenues 
net revenues consist of product sales  net of returns and allowances 
gross profit 
gross profit is net revenues less cost of revenues and is affected by a number of factors  including competitive pricing  product mix  foundry pricing  the cost of test and assembly services and manufacturing yields 
cost of revenues consists primarily of costs of manufacturing  assembly and testing of our products as well as compensation and associated costs related to manufacturing support  inbound freight shipments and quality assurance personnel 
it also can include  on occasion  adjustments to inventory valuations based on demand and average selling prices expected in future periods 
research and development 
research and development expense consists primarily of compensation and associated costs for engineering  technical and support personnel  contract engineering services  depreciation of equipment and cost of wafers and mask sets used to evaluate new products and new versions of current products 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation and associated costs for sales  marketing and administrative personnel  commissions  promotional activities  bad debt expense  outbound freight shipments  professional fees and director and officer insurance 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments based on historical experience and apply them on a consistent basis 
these estimates and judgments primarily relate to inventory valuation and warranty liabilities  which affects our cost of sales and gross margin  and the valuation of deferred income taxes and income taxes payable  which affects our income tax expense and benefit 
we also have other key accounting policies  such as our policies for revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts receivable and sales returns reserves 
the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying these critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements 
we believe that consistent application results in financial statements and accompanying notes that fairly represent our financial condition  operating results and cash flows for all periods presented 
however  any factual errors or errors in these estimates and judgments may have a material impact on our financial conditions  operating results and cash flows 
recognition of revenues we generally recognize revenues as products are shipped if all of the following criteria are met we have evidence that a sales arrangement exists  our customer has taken title to the products  we have delivered the products and performed the services  if any  the sales price is fixed or determinable  we believe that collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured  and we can reasonably estimate product returns 
we sell our products directly through our sales force and sales representatives to oems and indirectly through distributors and resellers that sell to their end customers 
we recognize revenues upon delivery to oem customers and resellers who have no product return rights and no price protection rights 
we deem that delivery occurs when legal title and the risk of loss transfers to the customer 
delivery is generally defined by the customers shipping terms  as stated in the related purchase order 
if the customers purchase orders do not define the shipping terms  the shipping terms will be ex works as defined in our invoice 
we record an estimated allowance for returns from oem customers and resellers  based on a percentage of our revenues 
this estimate is based on historical averages 
we sell to some of our distributors under agreements which provide for product return and price protection rights 
these agreements generally permit the distributor to return up to by value of the total products that the distributor has purchased from us in specified six month periods 
we defer recognition of revenues until such time as the distributor resells the product to their end customer  at which time the sales price becomes fixed 
on a monthly basis  we receive point of sales and ending inventory information from each distributor 
using this information  we determine the amount of revenues to recognize 
for distributors who have product return rights  we also record an inventory reserve to address the cost of products we anticipate that we will not be able to resell after their return by the distributors 
for distributors who have price protection rights  distributors may take the associated credits immediately and in general  we process the credits one or two months after the credit is taken by the distributor 
we record a reserve to cover the estimated liability of those unprocessed credits 
we re evaluate our revenue recognition policies periodically and no less often than annually 
we defer the recognition of revenue for certain resellers who have no product return rights and no price protection rights 
in accordance with our policy  we will generally defer the recognition of revenue for certain resellers based on their high dollar volume of purchases 
inventory valuation we value our inventory at the lower of standard cost or net realizable value 
standard cost approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis 
we routinely evaluate the value and quantities of our inventory in light of the current market conditions and market trends and we record reserves for quantities in excess of demand  cost in excess of market value and product age 
our analysis may take into consideration historical usage  expected demand  anticipated sales price  new product development schedules  the effect new products might have on the sales of existing products  product age  customer design activity  customer concentration and other factors 
our forecasts for our inventory usage may differ from actual inventory use 
the lives of our products are usually long and obsolescence has not been a significant factor historically in the valuation of our inventories 
we reduce the value of our inventory by analyzing on hand quantities and open purchase orders which are in excess of demand equal to the cost of inventory that exceeds expected demand for approximately the next to months 
we make judgments in establishing these reserves and do not establish reserves if we believe we can sell the excess inventory 
if market conditions are less favorable than those we estimate  we may be required to write down inventory 
if we overestimate the future selling prices  we will incur additional losses when the inventory is sold for a lower price or when we establish additional write downs to cover the even lower estimated sales price 
once written down  we establish a new cost basis and accordingly we do not reverse inventory provisions until the associated inventory has been sold or physically scrapped 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable we estimate the collectibility of our accounts receivable at the end of each reporting period 
we analyze the aging of accounts receivable and bad debt history  payment history  customer concentration  customer credit worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts  which is created by charges to selling  general and administrative expense 
our accounts receivable balance was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of  as of april  income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our current tax exposure and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenues  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included on our balance sheet on a net basis 
we then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we will include an additional tax provision in the statement of income 
we reassess and may adjust the estimated tax rate quarterly 
we apply the current tax rate to our year to date income and our tax provision and related accrual is adjusted accordingly 
our effective income tax rate was for fiscal we make significant judgments in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax asset 
as of april   our gross deferred tax assets  consisting primarily of net operating loss carryforwards  tax credit carryforwards and nondeductible reserves and accruals  were valued at million and our valuation allowance was zero 
we have concluded that all of our deferred tax assets will be realizable  based on available objective evidence and our history of income before taxes 
the calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex global tax regulations 
we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary  the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when the company determines the liabilities are no longer necessary 
if the estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  a further charge to expense would result

our net revenues decreased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the decrease in net revenues was primarily due to a decrease in eeprom average selling prices  which led to a decline of net revenues from our eeprom and flash memory products of million 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in net revenues from our analog mixed signal products of million  or to million for fiscal from million for fiscal  which resulted from the introduction of new products and increased sales to our existing oem customer base 
while we experienced an improved market demand that resulted in a increase in total unit volume sold to end customers in fiscal  net revenues decreased overall because the increase in total unit volume was off set by increased market competition in the more recent period resulting in a decrease in overall average selling prices 
in addition  our net revenues in fiscal benefited by approximately million from the termination of price adjustment and stock rotation rights of certain small regional resellers that had not historically used those rights  which resulted in recognition of revenue and gross margin for the inventories held by such resellers

selling  general and administrative expense decreased  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal as a percentage of net revenues  selling  general and administrative expense was in fiscal and in fiscal the decrease in selling  general and administrative expense was primarily attributable to a decrease in employee incentive and commission related compensation of  a decrease in consulting work performed for section compliance of  offset by an increase in depreciation expense for our new enterprise resource planning systems of  an increase in freight expense of  for increased unit shipments and an increase in marketing expense of  interest income and other  net 
we earned interest income and other  net  of million in fiscal as compared to interest income and other  net  of  in fiscal our rate of return on our average balance of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments was approximately in fiscal and approximately in fiscal the change was due to higher average interest rates experienced in fiscal compared to fiscal  partially offset by lower investable cash 
income tax provision benefit 
the provision for income taxes was million  or of income before taxes  for fiscal the provision for income taxes was million or of income before taxes  for fiscal the income tax rates are impacted by the level of available tax credits as compared to pretax income and the current estimate of the level of income subject to california taxation 
the provision for income taxes in fiscal has also been favorably impacted by the reversal of certain tax accruals upon expiry of the related statue of limitations 
although extension of the federal tax credit provision is expected during  the federal tax law authorizing such credits expired in december as a result  we cannot reflect the benefit of credits until the related laws are enacted 
comparison of the fiscal years ended april  and net revenues 
our net revenues decreased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the decrease in net revenues was primarily due to a decrease in eeprom unit volume sold  resulting in a decline of net revenues from our eeprom products of million

gross profit increased  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal gross margin  which equals gross profit divided by net revenues  was for fiscal and for fiscal the  improvement in gross profit in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to a decline in inventory costs and a reduction in our cost of revenues as a result of a million royalty expense we recognized in fiscal in connection with the settlement of disputed royalty obligations with philips electronics 
we also benefited from higher average selling prices for our flash memory and analog mixed signal products in fiscal these benefits to our gross profit in fiscal were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of movements in our inventory reserves in fiscal as compared to fiscal the benefit from sales of previously reserved inventory was million for fiscal and million for fiscal  and provisions for excess and obsolete inventory were million for fiscal and  for fiscal the net impact of these inventory provisions was a decrease in gross profit of  in fiscal as compared to an increase in gross profit of million in fiscal research and development 
research and development expense increased  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal as a percentage of net revenues  research and development expense was in fiscal and in fiscal the increase in research and development expense in fiscal was primarily attributable to a  increase in purchases of developmental mask sets and wafer fabrication related to product development and to a  increase in personnel related expenses  primarily as a result of an increase in headcount to support our product development efforts

our historical sources of cash and capital expenditures have come from our operating activities 
during fiscal  we repurchased  shares of common stock for approximately million and purchased a building in santa clara  california for million  which will serve as our principal headquarters when we relocate in august additionally  employees exercised stock options to generate million during fiscal we invest our excess cash in short term financial instruments to generate interest income 
these instruments are us government debt securities  the majority of which have maturities that are less than one year 
they are highly liquid and can be converted to cash at any time 
net cash from operating activities in fiscal  we had cash from operating activities of million  which resulted from net income of million  adjusted for non cash charges including depreciation and amortization of million  a charge of  for net movements in inventory reserves and a tax benefit of  related to the exercise of employee stock options 
cash provided by operating activities also included a decrease in gross accounts receivable of  related to our decrease in net revenues  an increase in accounts payable of million primarily due to the timing and amount of inventory purchases  and a decrease in accrued expenses of million related primarily to tax liabilities

common stock repurchase plan in september  our board of directors authorized a program for the open market repurchase of up to million shares of our common stock 
in subsequent periods  the board of directors amended the program and authorized the purchase up to an aggregate of  shares 
upon reaching the maximum number of shares authorized under this program  the board of directors authorized a new stock repurchase program of up to million shares in september the purpose of these share repurchase programs are to reduce the long term potential dilution in earnings per share that might result from issuances under our stock option plans

we have no current plans  nor are we currently negotiating  to obtain additional financing 
our long term plan is to finance our core business operations with cash we generate from operations 
however  from time to time we may raise additional capital through a variety of sources  including the public equity market  private financings  collaborative arrangements and debt 
the additional capital we raise could be used for working capital purposes  to fund our research and development activities or our capital expenditures or to acquire complementary businesses or technologies 
if we raise additional capital through the issuance of equity or securities convertible into equity  our stockholders may experience dilution 
those securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of the common stock 
additional financing may not be available to us on favorable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain financing  or to obtain it on acceptable terms  we may be unable to successfully support our business requirements

recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas sfas no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r eliminates the alternative of applying the intrinsic value measurement provisions of accounting principals board apb opinion no 
 or apb  to stock compensation awards issued to employees 
the new standard requires enterprises to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award  usually the vesting period 
the pro forma effects on net income and earnings per share as if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of original sfas no 
on stock compensation awards rather than applying the intrinsic value measurement provisions of apb are in the notes to consolidated financial statements see note 
although the pro forma effects of applying original sfas no 
may be indicative of the effects of adopting sfas no 
r  the provisions of these two statements differ in some important respects 
the actual effects of adopting sfas no 
r will be dependent on numerous factors including  but not limited to  the valuation model chosen by us to value stock based awards  the assumed award forfeiture rate  the accounting policies adopted concerning the method of recognizing the fair value of awards over the requisite service period  and the transition method chosen for adopting sfas no 
r 
adoption of this accounting standard will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
r will be effective for our fiscal quarter ending july  in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter the amendments made by sfas no 
are intended to improve financial reporting by clarifying that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted materials spoilage should be recognized as current period charges and by requiring the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the guidance is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements 
on may   the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and err or corrections  a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
 which changes the requirements for the accounting and reporting of a change in accounting principle effective for fiscal years beginning after december  sfas no 
applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle as well as to changes required by an accounting pronouncement that does not include specific transition provisions 
sfas no 
eliminates the requirement in apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  to include the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principle in the income statement in the period of change 
instead  to enhance the comparability of prior period financial statements  sfas no 
requires that changes in accounting principles be applied retrospectively 
under retrospective application  the new accounting principle is applied as of the beginning of the first period presented as if that principle had always been used 
under sfas no 
 a change in reporting entity is also applied retrospectively as of the beginning of the first period presented 
a change in accounting estimate continues to be accounted for in the period of change and future periods if necessary 
we are currently assessing the impact of adopting sfas no 
and believe the new standard will not have a material impact on its financial statements 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb released its final interpretation on uncertain tax positions  fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fas this interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
the guidance will become effective as of the beginning of a company s fiscal year beginning after december  the company is currently assessing the impact of adopting this standard 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
our investment portfolio is generally comprised of us government debt securities and cash deposits 
our policy is to place these investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards and have maturities of less than two years with an overall average maturity of less than one year 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk and could decline in value if interest rates fluctuate 
due to the short duration of the securities in which we invest and the conservative nature of our investment portfolio  a change in interest rates would have an immaterial effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
the majority of our sales  manufacturing costs  and research and development and marketing expenses are transacted in us dollars 
accordingly  our net profitability is not currently subject to material foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
gains and losses from fluctuations in exchange rates have not been material to us to date
