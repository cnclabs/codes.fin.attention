item b 
unresolved staff comments 
none item properties 
location and characteristics the company is dependent on oil and gas leases in wyoming and two petroleum contracts in china in order to explore for and produce oil and gas 
the leases in wyoming are primarily federal leases with year lease terms until establishment of production 
production on the lease extends the lease terms until cessation of that production 
there are approximately  gross  net acres currently held by production in wyoming 
the china petroleum contracts are for a maximum of years and are divided into periods  exploration  development and production 
the exploration period is for approximately years and work is to be performed and expenditures are to be incurred to delineate the extent and amount of hydrocarbons  if any  for each block 
the development period occurs when a field is discovered and commences on the date of approval of the ministry of energy 
there is no limit on the time allowed to develop a field other than the combined maximum of years 
the production period of any oil and gas field in a block is a period of consecutive years beginning on the date of commencement of commercial production from the field  unless extended 

table of contents green river basin  wyoming as of december   the company owned developed oil and gas leases totaling  gross  net acres in the green river basin of sublette county  wyoming which represents of the company s total domestic developed net acreage 
the company owns undeveloped oil and gas leases totaling  gross  net acres in the green river basin of sublette county  wyoming which represents of the company s total domestic undeveloped net acreage 
the company s acreage in the green river basin primarily covers the pinedale anticline with several other undeveloped acreage blocks north and west of the pinedale anticline as well as acreage in the jonah field 
holding costs of leases in wyoming not held by production were approximately  for the fiscal year ended december  the primary target on the company s wyoming acreage is the tight gas sands of the upper cretaceous lance pool formation 
exploratory wells 
during the year ended december   the company participated in the drilling and completion of a total of gross net productive exploratory wells on the green river basin properties 
at december   there were gross net additional exploratory wells that commenced during the year that were either still drilling  had drilling operations suspended or are in various stages of completion 
development wells 
during the year ended december   the company participated in the drilling and completion of gross net productive development wells in the pinedale field area 
at december   there were gross net additional development wells that commenced during that were either still drilling  had drilling operations suspended or are in various stages of completion 
additionally  gross net wells in jonah field had drilling operations commenced during that were either still drilling  had drilling operations suspended or are in various stages of completion 
for purposes of this report  development wells are wells identified as proven  undeveloped locations by the company s independent petroleum engineering firm netherland  sewell associates  inc at the previous year end reserve evaluation 
when drilled  these locations will be counted as development wells 
bohai bay  china block the petroleum sharing contract psc covering this block became effective october  negotiations with the chinese government in resulted in an extension of the third exploration term to september as the psc now stands  the exploration period will end at the end of september barring another extension  at that time  all acreage not under appraisal  development or production must be relinquished 
the company holds an exploration interest in the exploration portion of the block and an working interest in the cfd and and the cfd and producing oil fields 
this block covers  gross  net acres under the exploration phase and  gross  net acres under development  or approximately of the company s total gross international acreage 
block the psc covering this block became effective march  negotiations with cnooc at the end of resulted in a two year extension of the third exploration term to february  when  barring an extension  all acreage not under appraisal  development or production must be relinquished 
the extension granted by cnooc must be ratified by the chinese government which we anticipate will happen during the company holds a exploration interest in this block which covers  gross  net acres under the exploration phase and  gross  net acres under development 
this acreage constitutes approximately of the company s total gross international acreage 
exploration appraisal activity in  the company participated in drilling exploration well net which failed to find commercial quantities of oil 
the primary target formations on the blocks are the upper and lower minghuazhen  guantao and dongying formations 
development activity in july  the company started production at the cfd and fields on the block 
production well drilling at these fields continued through and will continue into the first half of the company has participated in drilling a total of production wells at the cfd and cfd fields 
in july  the company commenced production at the cfd and fields on the 
table of contents block 
the company has participated in drilling a total of production wells at the cfd and cfd fields 
the four field production complex currently consists of producing wells  three production platforms and an anchored fpso vessel 
upon declaration of commerciality of a field or area by cnooc  the company s share of all expenses within that area is decreased by  with the participation by cnooc 
for example  the company s exploration interest is reduced to an working interest in the fields on production in the block 
upon initiation of production  the sharing of production is determined by the language of the psc which states that for each individual field a chinese national industrial tax and royalty are applied to of the gross volumes of oil  lease operating expenses loe are then taken out of the remainder oil and after these deductions  of the remaining production stream is dedicated to exploration and development cost recovery for the participants 
the exploration cost recovery shall be recovered without interest  while the development cost recovery shall be calculated with a fixed annual interest rate of uplift  and the remaining of production goes to the remainder oil category which is divided into a share oil for cnooc and an allocable remainder oil for the contractors determined by a sliding scale determined by yearly production  x factor 
project profit is subject to chinese corporate tax 
there are three new fields  the cfd  cfd and cfd s that are currently being developed 
the cfd field area is on the block 
the cfd and cfd s field areas are on the block 
these development areas are located in close proximity and thus will be developed as a single unit within the blocks 
the development areas have been unitized because the fields are within both the and blocks where different parties have different levels of interest 
the unit allows for an equitable distribution of production known to exist within the known areas of the fields to the various parties 
on may   a unitization agreement was signed that assigned the company a working interest in the combined field unit 
on october   a year contract which provides for extension for up to an additional years  was signed by the operator to lease the fpso 
the company ratified the contract for its net share 
the fpso is a   dead weight tons  double hull fpso with a   barrels storage capacity  with single point mooring and a processing plant capable of processing  barrels oil per day expandable to  barrels oil per day 
the fpso service agreement calls for a day rate lease payment and a sliding scale per barrel payment that decreases based on cumulative barrels processed 
pennsylvania the company owns  gross  net acres in pennsylvania  which represents of the company s total domestic undeveloped net acreage 
holding costs of leases in pennsylvania not held by production were approximately  for the fiscal year ended december  exploratory wells 
during the year ended december   the company participated in the drilling and completion of a total of gross net successful exploratory well on the pennsylvania properties 
based on the test results  ultra is preparing to lay a pipeline to connect this well to sales 
it is anticipated that this connection should be completed during the first half of texas during the year ended  december   the company divested itself of a portion of its texas properties 
the company sold one gross net operated well along with the associated gross net acres 
the company is currently attempting to divest itself of its remaining interest in texas which consist of gross net non operated producing well  plus the associated gross net acres 
this represents of the company s total developed net acreage

the following discussion of the financial condition and operating results of the company should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes of the company 
except as 
table of contents otherwise indicated all amounts are expressed in us dollars 
we operate in one segment  natural gas and oil exploration and development with two geographical segments  the united states and china 
the company currently generates the majority of its revenue  earnings and cash flow from the production and sales of natural gas and oil from its property in southwest wyoming 
the price of natural gas in the southwest wyoming region is a critical factor to the company s business 
the price of natural gas in southwest wyoming historically has been volatile 
the average annual realizations for the period have ranged from to per mcf 
this volatility could be very detrimental to the company s financial performance 
the company seeks to limit the impact of this volatility on its results by entering into forward sales and derivative contracts for natural gas in southwest wyoming 
the average realization for the company s natural gas during calendar was per mcf  basis opal  wyoming  including the effect of hedges 
for the quarter ended december   the average realization for the company s natural gas was per mcf  basis opal  wyoming  including the effect of hedges 
on july  the company initiated production at the first two fields of the nine fields discovered on its oil properties offshore bohai bay  china 
production from these fields is characterized as a heavy  sweet crude 
the company sold its first cargos of oil in september during the twelve month period ended december   the company sold  barrels of its chinese oil production at a price based on the official icp posting for duri field crude  less a discount for location and quality differences 
these sales were made to an affiliate of cnooc at an average price of usd per barrel for the year ended december  for the quarter ended december   the company sold  barrels of its chinese crude for an average price of usd per barrel 
there can and will be differences in timing between the sale of the company s crude oil cargos and the company s pro rata share of production 
as a result of these timing differences  the company may  from time to time  carry inventories or imbalances of crude oil 
as of february   the duri price was approximately usd before discount per barrel 
the company expects to sell at least one cargo of its chinese crude oil production approximately every two months during the company has the right to export and sell its crude at market prices into the international markets  and is evaluating options to do so in the future 
other markets for the company s chinese oil may potentially be developed in south korea  japan  singapore or other countries 
the company has grown its natural gas and oil production significantly over the past five years and management believes it has the ability to continue growing production by drilling already identified locations on its leases in wyoming and by bringing into production the already discovered oil fields in china 
the company delivered production growth on an mcfe basis during the quarter ended december  as compared to the same quarter in and production growth for the year ended december  compared to the same period in management expects to deliver additional production growth during by drilling and bringing into production additional wells in wyoming and bringing into production additional fields in china 
production bcfe the company conducts operations in both the united states and china 
separate cost centers are maintained for each country in which the company has operations 
substantially all of the oil and gas activities are conducted jointly with others and  accordingly  amounts presented reflect only the company s proportionate interest in such activities 
inflation has not had a material impact on the company s results of operations and is not expected to have a material impact on the company s results of operations in the future 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations is based upon consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
in addition  application of gaap requires the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial 
table of contents statements as well as the revenues and expenses reported during the period 
changes in these estimates  judgments and assumptions will occur as a result of future events  and  accordingly  actual results could differ from amounts estimated 
use of estimates 
the more significant areas requiring the use of assumptions  judgments and estimates relate to volumes of oil and gas reserves used in calculating depletion  the amount of future net revenues used in computing the ceiling test limitations and the amount of abandonment obligations used in such calculations 
assumptions  judgments and estimates are also required in determining impairments of undeveloped properties and the valuation of deferred tax assets 
oil and gas reserves 
the company emphasizes that the volumes of reserves are estimates which  by their nature  are subject to revision 
the estimates are made using all available geological and reservoir data as well as production performance data 
these estimates are currently made annually by independent petroleum engineers and reviewed by the company s engineers 
the reserves are periodically reviewed and revised  either upward or downward  if warranted based upon additional data 
revisions are necessary due to changes in assumptions based on  among other things  reservoir performance  prices  economic conditions and governmental restrictions 
estimates of proved crude oil and natural gas reserves significantly affect the company s depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a expense 
for example  if estimates of proved reserves decline  the company s dd a rate will increase  resulting in a decrease in net income 
a decline in estimates of proved reserves could also result in a full cost ceiling write down see discussion below 
the present value of oil and gas properties represents the estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves  discounted using a prescribed discount rate pv 
proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of natural gas  crude oil  condensate and natural gas liquids that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty can be recovered in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
reserves are considered proved if they can be produced economically as demonstrated by either actual production or conclusive formation tests 
proved developed oil and gas reserves can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods 
due to the volatility of commodity prices  the oil and gas prices on the last day of the period significantly impact the calculation of the pv the present value of future net cash flows does not purport to be an estimate of the fair market value of the company s proved reserves 
an estimate of fair value would also take into account  among other things  anticipated changes in future prices and costs  the expected recovery of reserves in excess of proved reserves and a discount factor more representative of the time value of money and the risks inherent in producing oil and gas 
full cost method of accounting 
the company uses the full cost method of accounting for its oil and gas operations 
separate cost centers are maintained for each country in which the company incurs costs 
all costs incurred in the acquisition  exploration and development of properties including costs of surrendered and abandoned leaseholds  delay lease rentals  dry holes and overhead related to exploration and development activities are capitalized 
effective with the adoption of statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  the carrying amount of oil and gas properties includes estimated asset retirement costs recorded based on the fair value of the asset retirement obligation when incurred 
the sum of net capitalized costs and estimated future development costs of oil and gas properties for each full cost center are depleted using the units of production method 
changes in estimates of reserves  future development costs or asset retirement obligations are accounted for prospectively in our depletion calculation 
investments in unproved properties are not depleted pending the determination of the existence of proved reserves 
unproved properties are assessed periodically to ascertain whether impairment has occurred 
unproved properties whose costs are individually significant are assessed individually by considering the primary lease terms of the properties  the holding period of the properties  and geographic and geologic data obtained relating to the properties 
where it is not practicable to individually assess the amount of impairment of properties for which costs are not individually significant  such properties are grouped for purposes of 
table of contents assessing impairment 
the amount of impairment assessed is added to the costs to be amortized in the appropriate full cost pool 
companies that use the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and development activities are required to perform a ceiling test calculation each quarter 
the full cost ceiling test is an impairment test prescribed by sec regulation s x rule the ceiling test is performed quarterly on a country by country basis 
the ceiling limits such pooled costs to the aggregate of the present value of future net revenues attributable to proved crude oil and natural gas reserves discounted at plus the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties less any associated tax effects 
if such capitalized costs exceed the ceiling  the company will record a write down to the extent of such excess as a non cash charge to earnings 
any such write down will reduce earnings in the period of occurrence and result in lower dd a expense in future periods 
a write down may not be reversed in future periods  even though higher oil and natural gas prices may subsequently increase the ceiling 
the company did not have any write downs related to the full cost ceiling limitation in  or as of december   the ceiling limitation exceeded the carrying value of the company s oil and gas properties 
estimates of discounted future net cash flows at december  were based on average natural gas prices of approximately per mcf in the us and on average liquids prices of approximately per barrel in the us in china  estimates of discounted future net cash flows on crude oil were based on a net realized price of per barrel 
a reduction in oil and gas prices and or estimated quantities of oil and gas reserves would reduce the ceiling limitation and could result in a ceiling test write down 
asset retirement obligation 
the company s asset retirement obligations aro consist primarily of estimated costs of dismantlement  removal  site reclamation and similar activities associated with its oil and gas properties 
sfas no 
requires that the discounted fair value of a liability for an aro be recognized in the period in which it is incurred with the associated asset retirement cost capitalized as part of the carrying cost of the oil and gas asset 
the recognition of an aro requires that management make numerous estimates  assumptions and judgments regarding such factors as the existence of a legal obligation for an aro  estimated probabilities  amounts and timing of settlements  the credit adjusted  risk free rate to be used  inflation rates  and future advances in technology 
in periods subsequent to initial measurement of the aro  the company must recognize period to period changes in the liability resulting from the passage of time and revisions to either the timing or the amount of the original estimate of undiscounted cash flows 
increases in the aro liability due to passage of time impact net income as accretion expense 
the related capitalized cost  including revisions thereto  is charged to expense through dd a 
entitlements method of accounting for oil and gas sales 
the company generally sells natural gas  condensate and crude oil under both long term and short term agreements at prevailing market prices 
the company recognizes revenues when the products are delivered  which occurs when the customer has taken title and has assumed the risks and rewards of ownership  prices are fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company accounts for oil and gas sales using the entitlements method 
under the entitlements method  revenue is recorded based upon the company s ownership share of volumes sold  regardless of whether it has taken its ownership share of such volumes 
the company records a receivable or a liability to the extent it receives less or more than its share of the volumes and related revenue 
under the alternative sales method of accounting for oil and gas sales  revenue would be recorded based on volumes taken by the company or allocated to it by third parties  regardless of whether such volumes are more or less than its ownership share of volumes produced 
reserve estimates would be adjusted to reflect any over produced or under produced positions 
receivables or payables would be recognized on a company s balance sheet only to the extent that remaining reserves are not sufficient to satisfy volumes over or under produced 
make up provisions and ultimate settlements of volume imbalances are generally governed by agreements between the company and its partners with respect to specific properties or  in the absence of such agreements  through negotiation 
the value of volumes over or under produced can change based on changes in commodity prices 
the company prefers the entitlements method of accounting for oil and gas sales because it allows for recognition of revenue based on its actual share of jointly owned production  results in 
table of contents better matching of revenue with related operating expenses  and provides balance sheet recognition of the estimated value of product imbalances 
valuation of deferred tax assets 
the company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  future income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial statement carrying values and their respective income tax basis temporary differences 
to assess the realization of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
as of december   the company had us federal regular tax net operating loss carryforwards nol s of approximately million which were fully utilized to offset us taxable income in commodity derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the company may  from time to time  enter into commodity derivative contracts and or fixed price physical contracts to manage its exposure to oil and natural gas price volatility 
the company has  in the past  primarily utilized fixed price forward sales of physical gas when it hedges some portion of its wyoming natural gas production 
these transactions are generally placed with major financial institutions or with counter parties of high credit quality that present minimal credit risks to the company 
the company may also secure payments under these types of transactions by requiring the counterparty to provide letter s of credit 
on a less frequent basis  the company may enter into commodity derivative contracts to manage price volatility 
to the extent that it does enter into such derivative transactions  the company expects that the oil and natural gas reference prices of these commodity derivatives contracts will be based upon crude oil and or natural gas futures contracts which  when adjusted for location basis differentials  will have a high degree of historical correlation with actual prices the company receives 
under sfas no 
 all derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
changes in the derivative s fair value are recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
for qualifying cash flow hedges  the gain or loss on the derivative is deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income loss to the extent the hedge is effective 
for qualifying fair value hedges  the gain or loss on the derivative is offset by the related results of the hedged item in the income statement 
gains and losses on hedging instruments included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss on the balance sheet are reclassified to oil and natural gas sales revenue in the period that the related production is delivered 
derivative contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are recorded as derivative assets and liabilities at market value in the consolidated balance sheet  and the associated unrealized gains and losses are recorded as current expense or income in the consolidated statement of operations 
the company currently does not have any derivative contracts related to the marketing of its natural gas or oil production in effect  the last one having expired on december  legal  environmental and other contingencies 
a provision for legal  environmental and other contingencies is charged to expense when the loss is probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated 
determining when expenses should be recorded for these contingencies and the appropriate amounts for accrual is a complex estimation process that includes the subjective judgment of management 
in many cases  management s judgment is based on interpretation of laws and regulations  which can be interpreted differently by regulators and or courts of law 
the company s management closely monitors known and potential legal  environmental and other contingencies and periodically determines when the company should record losses for these items based on information available to the company 
share based payment arrangements 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payments sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
apb opinion 
among other items  sfas no 
r eliminates the use of apb opinion and the intrinsic value method of accounting  and requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments  based on the grant date fair value of those awards  in the financial statements 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative under the new standard 
the 
table of contents company will adopt sfas no 
r as of the required effective date for calendar year companies  which is january  sfas no 
r permits companies to adopt its requirements using either a modified prospective method  or a modified retrospective method 
under the modified prospective method  compensation cost is recognized in the financial statements beginning with the effective date  based on the requirements of sfas no 
r for all share based payments granted after that date  and based on the requirements of sfas no 
for all unvested awards granted prior to the effective date of sfas no 
r 
under the modified retrospective method  the requirements are the same as under the modified prospective method  but also permit entities to restate financial statements of previous periods based on proforma disclosures made in accordance with sfas no 
at december   all stock options granted to date were fully vested 
the company currently utilizes a standard option pricing model ie  black scholes to measure the fair value of stock options granted to employees 
while sfas no 
r permits entities to continue to use such a model  the standard also permits the use of a more complex binomial  or lattice model 
based upon research done by the company on the alternative models available to value option grants  and in conjunction with the type and number of stock options expected to be issued in the future  the company has determined that it will continue to use the black scholes model for option valuation as of the current time 
sfas no 
r includes several modifications to the way that income taxes are recorded in the financial statements 
the expense for certain types of option grants is only deductible for tax purposes at the time that the taxable event takes place  which could cause variability in the company s effective tax rates recorded throughout the year 
sfas no 
r does not allow companies to predict when these taxable events will take place 
furthermore  it requires that the benefits associated with the tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after the effective date 
these future amounts cannot be estimated  because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options

the company agreed to become an anchor shipper on the proposed rockies express pipeline project  sponsored by subsidiaries of kinder morgan and sempra energy 
the rockies express pipeline  if built as proposed  would be the largest natural gas transmission pipeline project of its type built in the united states in more than years  beginning at the opal processing plant in southwest wyoming and traversing wyoming and several other states to an ultimate terminus in eastern ohio 
this project is projected to cover more than  miles and is contemplated to be a large diameter  high pressure natural gas pipeline 
the rockies express pipeline  if built  will be an interstate pipeline and would therefore be subject to the jurisdiction of the united states federal energy regulatory commission ferc 
on december   the company signed two precedent agreements with rockies express pipeline  llc and entrega gas pipeline llc governing how the parties will proceed through the design  regulatory process and construction of the pipeline facilities and  subject to certain conditions precedent  the company will take firm transportation service if and when the pipeline facilities are constructed 
commencing upon completion of the pipeline facilities  the company s commitment involves capacity of  mmbtu per day of natural gas for a term of years  and the company will be obligated to pay to rockies express certain demand charges related to its rights to hold this firm transportation capacity as an anchor shipper 
based on current assumptions  current projections regarding the cost of the expansion and the participation of other shippers in the expansion noting specifically that these assumptions are likely to change materially  the company currently projects that annual demand charges due may be approximately million per year for the term of the contract  exclusive of fuel and surcharges 
the company s board of directors approved the precedent agreements on february  and kinder morgan  as the managing member of the rockies express pipeline llc advised the company of their final approval of the precedent agreements  and their intent to proceed with the construction of the rockies express pipeline on february  the pipeline facilities are currently anticipated to be completed in stages between and although the company is optimistic that the rockies express pipeline project will receive the necessary regulatory approvals and be constructed in a timely manner  there can be no assurances that the rockies express pipeline will be built  nor will there be any assurances that  if built  it will prevent large basis differentials from occurring in the future 
additionally  in maintaining its acreage base that is not held by production  the company incurs certain expenses  including delay rental costs

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to its natural gas and oil production 
realized pricing is currently driven primarily by the prevailing price for the company s wyoming natural gas production 
historically  prices received for natural gas production have been volatile and unpredictable 
pricing volatility is expected to continue 
natural gas price realizations ranged from a monthly low of per mcf to a monthly high of per mcf during realized natural gas prices are derived from the financial statements which include the effects of hedging and natural gas balancing 
the company may  from time to time  use derivative instruments as one way to manage its exposure to commodity prices 
the company has periodically entered into fixed price to index price swap agreements in order to hedge a portion of its production 
the purpose of the swaps is to provide a measure of stability to the company s cash flows in an environment of volatile oil and gas prices 
the derivatives reduce the company s exposure on the hedged volumes to decreases in commodity prices and limit the benefit the company might otherwise have received from any increases in commodity prices on the hedged volumes 
the company recognizes all derivative instruments as assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value 
the accounting treatment of the changes in fair value as specified in sfas no 
is dependent upon whether or not a derivative instrument is designated as a hedge 
for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges  changes in fair value  to the extent the hedge is effective  are recognized in other comprehensive income loss on the balance sheet until the hedged item is recognized in earnings as oil and gas revenue 
for all other derivatives  changes in fair value are recognized in earnings as income or expense 
as of december   the company no longer assesses the future liability of cash flow hedges as all agreements qualifying as such have expired

this total includes  for the first quarter of   for the second quarter of   for the third quarter of  and  for the fourth quarter of at december   the company had no open derivative contracts to manage price risk on its natural gas production 
the company also utilizes fixed price forward natural gas sales at southwest wyoming delivery points to hedge its commodity exposure
