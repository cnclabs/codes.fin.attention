critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates the accounting and reporting policies of the company conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and general practices within the financial services industry 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company considers that the determination of the allowance for loan losses involves a higher degree of judgment and complexity than its other significant accounting policies 
the allowance for loan losses is calculated with the objective of maintaining an allowance level believed by management to be sufficient to absorb estimated loan losses 
management s determination of the adequacy of the allowance is based on periodic evaluations of the loan portfolio and other relevant factors 
however  this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates  including  among others  expected default probabilities  loss once loans default  expected commitment usage  the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  value of collateral  estimated losses  and general amounts for historical loss experience 
the process also considers economic conditions  uncertainties in estimating losses and inherent risks in the loan portfolio 
all of these factors may be susceptible to significant change 
to the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates  additional provisions for loan losses may be required that would adversely impact earnings in future periods 
additional discussion of the allowance for loan losses is included in the company s annual report on form k for the year ended december   under the section titled item business allowances for losses on loans and foreclosed assets 
judgments and assumptions used by management in the past have resulted in an overall allowance for loan losses that has been sufficient to absorb estimated loan losses 

next page inherent in this process is the evaluation of individual significant credit relationships 
from time to time certain credit relationships may deteriorate due to payment performance  cash flow of the borrower  value of collateral  or other factors 
in these instances  management may have to revise its loss estimates and assumptions for these specific credits due to changing circumstances 
in some cases  additional losses may be realized  in other instances  the factors that led to the deterioration may improve or the credit may be refinanced elsewhere and allocated allowances may be released from the particular credit 
for the periods included in these financial statements  management s overall methodology for evaluating the allowance for loan losses has not changed significantly 
stock split all share and per share amounts have been adjusted for the two for one stock split in the form of a stock dividend declared in may general the profitability of the company and  more specifically  the profitability of its primary subsidiary  great southern bank the bank  depends primarily on its net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between the interest income it earns on its loans and investment portfolio  and the interest it pays on interest bearing liabilities  which consists mainly of interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
net interest income is affected by the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the interest rates earned or paid on these balances 
when interest earning assets approximate or exceed interest bearing liabilities  any positive interest rate spread will generate net interest income 
in  great southern was able to generate significant loan growth and thereby generate additional interest income 
as loan demand is affected by a variety of factors  including general economic conditions  we cannot be assured that our loan growth will continue at its current pace 
if economic conditions remain strong in future periods  we believe that we are well positioned to capture loan market share in our southwest missouri market as well as our loan production markets of st 
louis  kansas city and northwest arkansas 
in addition  we may consider other markets in which to establish loan production offices 
we expect that the majority of our loan portfolio growth will continue to be in the commercial real estate and residential and commercial construction categories 
in the year ended december   commercial real estate loan balances including industrial revenue bonds on commercial real estate projects increased million and construction loan balances increased million 
a portion of this loan growth was funded by attracting deposit accounts from our retail branch network  correspondent banking and corporate services customers 
the company then utilized these funding sources to meet loan demand from existing and new customers 
in the year ended december   total deposit balances increased million 
of this total increase  brokered certificate balances increased million  customer checking accounts increased million  and retail certificates increased million 
as the generation of increased net interest income is critical to the growth of great southern s earnings  the continued ability to attract deposits or to fund loan growth through other funding sources is very important to our success 
although there is a high level of competition for deposits in our markets  we were successful in attracting deposits in while it is our goal to continue to aggressively gain deposit market share in our branch footprint  we cannot be assured of this in future periods 
our ability to fund growth in future periods may also be dependent on our ability to continue to access brokered deposits and fhlbank advances 
in times when our loan demand has outpaced our generation of new deposits  we have utilized brokered deposits and fhlbank advances to fund these loans 
in the year ended december   the outstanding balance of fhlbank advances decreased million due to deposit growth and increases in brokered certificates 
fhlbank advances have been attractive to us because we can create variable rate funding which more closely matches the variable rate nature of much of our loan portfolio 
while we do not currently anticipate that our ability to access these funding sources will be reduced or eliminated in future periods  if this should happen  the limitation on our ability to fund additional loans would adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 

next page our net interest income may be affected positively or negatively by market interest rate changes 
a large portion of our loan portfolio is tied to the prime rate and adjusts immediately when this rate adjusts 
we also have a large portion of our liabilities that will reprice with changes to the federal funds rate or the three month libor rate 
we monitor our sensitivity to interest rate changes on an ongoing basis see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
the company s profitability is also affected by the level of its non interest income and operating expenses 
non interest income consists primarily of the effects of the company s interest rate swaps  gains on sales of loans and available for sale investments  service charges and atm fees  commissions earned by non bank affiliates and other general operating income 
operating expenses consist primarily of salaries and employee benefits  occupancy related expenses  postage  insurance  advertising  office expenses and other general operating expenses 
in  non interest income decreased primarily due to the restated effects of the company s interest rate swaps and the realized impairment of one available for sale investment 
in  the fair value of the company s interest rate swaps decreased significantly as a result of increasing market interest rates throughout the year 
in addition  the net settlements received on these interest rate swaps decreased in compared to as the company s variable interest payments increased due to rising libor rates 
this was partially offset by increases in service charges and overdraft fees and increases in commission revenues earned by the company s travel  insurance and investment divisions 
fees from service charges and overdrafts will likely increase moderately in compared to as we expect that retail checking accounts will grow slowly in we expect to continue to add checking balances  however  much of this growth is expected to come from additional corporate and correspondent banking relationships which typically do not generate as much fee income as smaller individual checking accounts 
the level of commission revenue is likely to remain at or slightly above levels in  assuming no substantial shocks occur in the financial markets or the travel industry 
in  operating expenses increased primarily in the categories of salaries and benefits and occupancy expense 
we anticipate that increases will occur again in  at a bit more moderate level  with regard to employee costs and occupancy expenses as we continue to add new branches in southwest missouri and the kansas city market area to serve new and existing customers and support growth in lending and operational areas 
in  we expect to add one to three new branch locations 
in addition  in  we opened a loan production office in columbia  missouri to serve new and existing customers in the central part of the state 
we anticipate that lending opportunities will continue to increase in our existing loan production offices in st 
louis  kansas city and northwest arkansas and we will increase staffing as needed in these offices to meet demand for commercial and residential loans 
the operations of the bank  and banking institutions in general  are significantly influenced by general economic conditions and related monetary and fiscal policies of regulatory agencies 
deposit flows and the cost of deposits and borrowings are influenced by interest rates on competing investments and general market rates of interest 
lending activities are affected by the demand for financing real estate and other types of loans  which in turn are affected by the interest rates at which such financing may be offered and other factors affecting loan demand and the availability of funds 
ongoing changes in the level and shape of the interest rate yield curve pose challenges for interest rate risk management 
beginning in  market interest rates were in a downward trend  settling at historically low levels from late through early during this period  great southern was able to effectively manage its interest rate risk and maintain its net interest margin at fairly stable levels 

next page in the second half of and throughout  the board of governors of the frb increased short term interest rates through steady increases to the federal funds rate 
other short term rates  such as libor and short term u 
s 
treasury rates  began to increase in conjunction with these increases by the frb 
by the end of  the frb had raised the federal funds rates by and other short term rates rose by corresponding amounts 
however  there was not a parallel shift in the yield curve  intermediate and long term interest rates did not increase at a corresponding pace 
in some cases  these rates actually declined 
this caused the shape of the interest rate yield curve to become much flatter  which creates different issues for interest rate risk management 
in addition during this period  great southern s net interest margin was affected by certain characteristics of some of its loans  deposit mix  loan and deposit pricing by competitors  and timing of interest rate increases by the frb as compared to interest rate increases in the financial markets 
the effect of these factors began to be seen in the fourth quarter of in the form of net interest margin compression 
this margin compression continued and increased during the first half of  before stabilizing in the second half of generally  the flattening interest rate yield curve has hurt great southern s ability to reinvest proceeds from loan and investment repayments at higher rates 
the company s cost of funds has increased faster than its yield on loans and investments in part because of aggressive pricing of deposits by competitors in local markets 
great southern has increased rates on checking  money market and retail certificate accounts in order to remain competitive  while not leading the market 
great southern s deposit mix has also led to more rapidly increasing interest rates 
the company has significant balances in high dollar money market and premium now accounts  the owners of which are very rate sensitive and compare these products to other bank and non bank products available by competing financial services companies 
in addition  nearly all of great southern s brokered certificates of deposit are subject to interest rate swaps which create variable rate funding based on three month libor 
as the market anticipates rate increases by the frb  libor rates tend to increase ahead of the frb federal funds rate increases 
the rate earned on the portion of the company s loan portfolio which is tied to the prime rate of interest only increases when the frb actually increases the federal funds rate 
margin compression has also occurred in the company s investment securities portfolio 
the company added securities in and to pledge as collateral to secure public funds deposits and customer reverse repurchase agreements 
the interest rates paid to these customers has increased consistent with short term market interest rate increases  while the overall yield on the investment portfolio has not increased significantly from december  to december  in the first half of  the company earned a greater spread on these securities due to the very low rate environment and the then steeper interest rate yield curve 
as borrowing costs have increased  the spread earned on these securities has decreased 
the company has also repositioned some of its investment portfolio over time to shorten the time frame its securities will reprice  resulting in lower interest rate yields currently 
at december   the company also had a portfolio of prime based loans totaling approximately million with rates that change immediately with changes to the prime rate of interest 
of this total  million represented loans which had interest rate floors 
these floors were at varying rates  with million of loans having floor rates between and 
during and  the company s loan portfolio had loans with rate floors that were much lower 
however  since market interest rates were also much lower at that time  these loan rate floors went into effect and established a loan rate which was higher than the contractual rate would have otherwise been 
this led to a loan portfolio yield which was approximately basis points higher than the prime rate of interest at december  as interest rates rose in the second half of and throughout  these interest rate floors were exceeded and the loans reverted back to their normal contractual interest rate terms 
at december   the loan portfolio yield was approximately basis points higher than the prime rate of interest  resulting in lower interest rate margins 
at december   the loan portfolio yield versus the prime rate of interest was down to a difference of basis points 

next page effect of federal laws and regulations federal legislation and regulation significantly affect the banking operations of the company and the bank  and have increased competition among commercial banks  savings institutions  mortgage banking enterprises and other financial institutions 
in particular  the capital requirements and operations of regulated depository institutions such as the company and the bank have been and will be subject to changes in applicable statutes and regulations from time to time  which changes could  under certain circumstances  adversely affect the company or the bank 
recent accounting pronouncements the emerging issues task force eitf of fasb previously issued eitf issue  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
eitf issue provides guidance on the meaning of the phrase other than temporary impairment and its application to several types of investments  including debt securities classified as held to maturity and available for sale under fasb statement no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
eitf issue attempted to better define whether impairment losses should be recognized on available for sale securities prior to sale of the securities 
it provided guidance for evaluating whether and when unrealized losses should be deemed other than temporary  requiring immediate recognition of those losses through earnings 
in addition  eitf requires financial statement disclosure for impaired securities on which an impairment loss has not been recognized  including the amount of unrealized loss and the term of that impairment 
certain portions of eitf were delayed in order for the fasb staff to provide implementation guidance and clarify several issues that were raised by interested parties during the public comment period 
fasb ultimately directed the fasb staff to issue a staff position fsp in order to complete and codify the guidance on this topic 
in november  the fasb issued fsp nos 
fas and fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  to provide guidance on determining when investments in certain debt and equity securities are considered impaired  whether that impairment is other than temporary  and the measurement of an impairment loss 
this guidance also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other than temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other than temporary impairments 
this fsp amends fasb statement no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  fasb statement no 
 accounting for certain investments held by not for profit organizations  and apb opinion no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock 
the guidance nullifies certain requirements of eitf issue and supersedes eitf topic no 
d  recognition of other than temporary impairment upon the planned sale of a security whose cost exceeds fair value 
the guidance in this fsp will apply to reporting periods beginning after december   with earlier application permitted 
the company does not believe the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on the financial condition or the results of operation of the company 

next page in december  the fasb issued a revision to fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
fasb statement no 
r  share based payment sfas r  supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  and its related implementation guidance 
sfas r established standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services  including transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of the equity instruments 
the impact to the company of sfas r focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions in this case primarily stock options 
the company currently accounts for its stock based compensation using the intrinsic method as defined in apb and  accordingly  has not recognized expense for stock option plans in the consolidated financial statements see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the company s accounting for stock based compensation 
the sec delayed the required implementation date of sfas r for public entities 
implementation of sfas r is now required for the company beginning in the interim period ending march  the company is currently evaluating the requirements of this pronouncement to determine the impact on its financial statements 
as a result of sfas r  the company may adopt different models than are currently utilized to calculate the expense effect associated with the company s stock options 
note of the notes to consolidated financial statements illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if the company had applied the fair value provisions of sfas in a related matter to sfas r  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payments sab  to give public companies guidance in applying the provisions of sfas r 
among other things  sab provides interpretive guidance related to the interaction between sfas r and certain sec rules and regulations  as well as provides the sec s views regarding the valuation of share based payment arrangements for public companies

this statement replaces apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and sfas no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements  and changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
sfas no 
applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle and to changes required by an accounting pronouncement that does not include specific transition provisions 
generally  this statement requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principle 
the provisions of this statement are effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  the company does not believe the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on the financial condition or the results of operation of the company 
in july  the fasb issued an exposure draft accounting for uncertain tax positions  an interpretation of sfas no 
accounting for income taxes 
this exposure draft addresses accounting for tax uncertainties that arise when a position that an entity takes on its tax return may be different from the position that the taxing authority may take  and provides guidance about the accounting for tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions  classification of a liability recognized for those positions  and interim reporting considerations 
the final version of this interpretation has not yet been issued 
the company is evaluating the requirements of the exposure draft to determine the impact  if any  on the financial condition or the results of operation of the company 
in january  the fasb issued an exposure draft the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
this exposure draft would provide companies with the option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value 
under the option  any changes in fair value would be included in earnings 
the proposed standard seeks to reduce both complexity in accounting and volatility in earnings caused by differences in the existing accounting rules 
current accounting principles use different measurement attributes for different assets and liabilities  which can lead to earnings volatility 
the proposed standard helps to mitigate this type of accounting induced volatility by enabling companies to achieve a more consistent accounting for changes in the fair value of related assets and liabilities without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
under this proposal  entities would be able to measure at fair value financial assets and liabilities selected on a contract by contract basis 
they would be required to display those values separately from those measured under different attributes on the face of the balance sheet 
furthermore  the proposal would require companies to provide additional information that would help investors and other users of financial statements to more easily understand the effect on earnings 
the company is evaluating the exposure draft to determine the impact  if adopted  on certain of its financial assets and liabilities

the main loan areas experiencing increases were commercial construction  commercial real estate  industrial revenue bonds and consumer 
the company s strategy continues to be focused on growing the loan portfolio  while maintaining credit risk and interest rate risk at appropriate levels 
for many years  the company has developed a niche in commercial real estate and construction lending in southwest missouri 
great southern s strategy is to continue to build on this competency in southwest missouri and in other geographic areas through the company s loan production offices 
in addition  loan growth should continue as we strengthen existing relationships with loan customers who are expanding their operations in other areas 
available for sale investment securities increased by million  which was primarily an increase in us government agency securities and an increase in tax exempt securities issued by states and municipalities

management intends to continue to buy stock back from time to time as long as management believes that repurchasing the stock contributes to the overall growth of shareholder value 
the timing of repurchases  number of shares of stock that will be repurchased and the price that will be paid is the result of many factors  several of which are outside the control of the company 
the primary factors  however  are the number of shares available in the market from sellers at any given time  the price of the stock within the market as determined by the market  and the projected impact on the company s earnings per share

next page provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses the provision for loan losses was million and million during the years ended december  and december   respectively 
the allowance for loan losses increased million  or  at december  compared to december  management records a provision for loan losses in an amount it believes sufficient to result in an allowance for loan losses that will cover current net charge offs as well as risks believed to be inherent in the loan portfolio of the bank 
the amount of provision charged against current income is based on several factors  including  but not limited to  past loss experience  current portfolio mix  actual and potential losses identified in the loan portfolio  economic conditions  regular reviews by internal staff and regulatory examinations 
weak economic conditions  higher inflation or interest rates  or other factors may lead to increased losses in the portfolio 
management has established various controls in an attempt to limit future losses  such as a watch list of possible problem loans  documented loan administration policies and a loan review staff to review the quality and anticipated collectibility of the portfolio 
management determines which loans are potentially uncollectible  or represent a greater risk of loss and makes additional provisions to expense  if necessary  to maintain the allowance at a satisfactory level 
the bank s allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was and at december  and  respectively 
management considers the allowance for loan losses adequate to cover losses inherent in the company s loan portfolio at this time  based on current economic conditions 
if economic conditions deteriorate significantly  it is possible that additional assets would be classified as non performing  and accordingly  an additional provision for losses would be required  thereby adversely affecting future results of operations and financial condition

these loans are not reflected in the non performing assets 
during the year ended december   potential problem loans decreased primarily due to the transfer to the non performing loan category portions of three unrelated loan relationships and the removal of one relationship from potential problem loan status due to loan balance reductions and improvements to the credit relationship 
at december   four large unrelated relationships make up the majority of the potential problem loan category 
the first relationship totals million with an additional million included in non performing loans and is secured primarily by vacant land  developed and undeveloped residential subdivisions  and single family houses used as rental property in the branson  missouri  area 
this relationship was described as a million relationship in the september quarterly report on form q in the category potential problem loans

non interest income including the effects of the company s restatement for interest rate swaps  total non interest income decreased million  or  in the year ended december  when compared to the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to i a negative change in the fair value of the company s interest rate swaps of million  from a positive million to a negative million  as a result of changes in related market interest rates  ii a decrease in the amount of interest rate swap net settlements received from counter parties of million  and iii an increase in the net realized loss on sales and impairments of available for sale securities in of  during  the company determined that the impairment of one security with an original cost of million had become other than temporary 
consequently  the company recorded a  charge to income 
additionally in  the company realized a gain of  on the sale of land that had been previously purchased for a branch location 
after completion of the branch  most of the remaining land was sold

the increase in service charges and fees resulted from a larger number of accounts and a higher level of insufficient funds transactions by customers 
the increase in atm point of sale fees was related to increases in overall usage by customers  primarily in point of sale usage 
increases in commission revenues occurred in the travel and investments divisions 
in the latter half of  the company acquired two travel agencies in the springfield  missouri market and  in mid  we acquired a travel agency in columbia  missouri 
the operations of these agencies  along with organic growth in our existing travel operations  have led to increased revenue in both the leisure and corporate travel areas 
in late  we began to implement some strategic sales initiatives in our investment division and throughout our branch network 
increased sales of a variety of investment products were realized during as a result of these initiatives 
while loan prepayments occur from time to time  in  a few unrelated borrowers elected to pay off some or all of their loans prior to the contractual maturity  with the company receiving large prepayment penalties on those loans that allowed for penalties as part of the borrowing agreements 
the company includes prepayment penalties in many of its loans  however  there is no way to estimate the level or timing of prepayment penalties that may be realized in future periods

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk asset and liability management and market risk a principal operating objective of the company is to produce stable earnings by achieving a favorable interest rate spread that can be sustained during fluctuations in prevailing interest rates 
the company has sought to reduce its exposure to adverse changes in interest rates by attempting to achieve a closer match between the periods in which its interest bearing liabilities and interest earning assets can be expected to reprice through the origination of adjustable rate mortgages and loans with shorter terms to maturity and the purchase of other shorter term interest earning assets 
since the company uses laddered brokered deposits and fhlbank advances to fund a portion of its loan growth  the company s assets tend to reprice more quickly than its liabilities 
our risk when interest rates change the rates of interest we earn on assets and pay on liabilities generally are established contractually for a period of time 
market interest rates change over time 
accordingly  our results of operations  like those of other financial institutions  are impacted by changes in interest rates and the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities 
the risk associated with changes in interest rates and our ability to adapt to these changes is known as interest rate risk and is great southern s most significant market risk 
how we measure the risk to us associated with interest rate changes in an attempt to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates and comply with applicable regulations  we monitor great southern s interest rate risk 
in monitoring interest rate risk we regularly analyze and manage assets and liabilities based on their payment streams and interest rates  the timing of their maturities and their sensitivity to actual or potential changes in market interest rates 
the ability to maximize net interest income is largely dependent upon the achievement of a positive interest rate spread that can be sustained despite fluctuations in prevailing interest rates 
interest rate sensitivity is a measure of the difference between amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities which either reprice or mature within a given period of time 
the difference  or the interest rate repricing gap  provides an indication of the extent to which an institution s interest rate spread will be affected by changes in interest rates 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities repricing during the same period  and is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets during the same period 
generally  during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap within shorter repricing periods would adversely affect net interest income  while a positive gap within shorter repricing periods would result in an increase in net interest income 
during a period of falling interest rates  the opposite would be true 
as of december   great southern s internal interest rate risk models indicate a one year interest rate sensitivity gap that is slightly negative 
interest rate risk exposure estimates the sensitivity gap are not exact measures of an institution s actual interest rate risk 
they are only indicators of interest rate risk exposure produced in a simplified modeling environment designed to allow management to gauge the bank s sensitivity to changes in interest rates 
they do not necessarily indicate the impact of general interest rate movements on the bank s net interest income because the repricing of certain categories of assets and liabilities is subject to competitive and other factors beyond the bank s control 
as a result  certain assets and liabilities indicated as maturing or otherwise repricing within a stated period may in fact mature or reprice at different times and in different amounts and cause a change  which potentially could be material  in the bank s interest rate risk 

next page in order to minimize the potential for adverse effects of material and prolonged increases and decreases in interest rates on great southern s results of operations  great southern has adopted asset and liability management policies to better match the maturities and repricing terms of great southern s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
management recommends and the board of directors sets the asset and liability policies of great southern which are implemented by the asset and liability committee 
the asset and liability committee is chaired by the chief financial officer and is comprised of members of great southern s senior management 
the purpose of the asset and liability committee is to communicate  coordinate and control asset liability management consistent with great southern s business plan and board approved policies 
the asset and liability committee establishes and monitors the volume and mix of assets and funding sources taking into account relative costs and spreads  interest rate sensitivity and liquidity needs 
the objectives are to manage assets and funding sources to produce results that are consistent with liquidity  capital adequacy  growth  risk and profitability goals 
the asset and liability committee meets on a monthly basis to review  among other things  economic conditions and interest rate outlook  current and projected liquidity needs and capital positions and anticipated changes in the volume and mix of assets and liabilities 
at each meeting  the asset and liability committee recommends appropriate strategy changes based on this review 
the chief financial officer or his designee is responsible for reviewing and reporting on the effects of the policy implementations and strategies to the board of directors at their monthly meetings 
in order to manage its assets and liabilities and achieve the desired liquidity  credit quality  interest rate risk  profitability and capital targets  great southern has focused its strategies on originating adjustable rate loans  and managing its deposits and borrowings to establish stable relationships with both retail customers and wholesale funding sources 
at times  depending on the level of general interest rates  the relationship between long and short term interest rates  market conditions and competitive factors  we may determine to increase our interest rate risk position somewhat in order to maintain or increase our net interest margin 
the asset and liability committee regularly reviews interest rate risk by forecasting the impact of alternative interest rate environments on net interest income and market value of portfolio equity  which is defined as the net present value of an institution s existing assets  liabilities and off balance sheet instruments  and evaluating such impacts against the maximum potential changes in net interest income and market value of portfolio equity that are authorized by the board of directors of great southern 
the company uses interest rate swap derivatives to manage its interest rate risks from recorded financial liabilities 
interest rate swaps are carried at fair value  estimated using quoted dealer prices  and are recognized in the statement of financial condition in the prepaid expenses and other assets or accounts payable and accrued expenses caption 
the company uses interest rate swaps to help manage its interest rate risks from recorded financial liabilities 
these instruments are utilized when they can be demonstrated to effectively hedge a designated liability and the liability exposes the company to interest rate risk 
for those interest rate swaps which meet the requirements for hedge accounting treatment  amounts to be paid or received under interest rate swaps are accounted for on the accrual basis and recognized as interest income or expense of the related liability 
for those interest rate swaps which do not meet the requirements for hedge accounting treatment  amounts to be paid or received under interest rate swaps are accounted for on the accrual basis and recognized as noninterest income 
gains and losses on early termination of these instruments are deferred and amortized as an adjustment to the yield on the related liability over the shorter of the remaining contract life or the maturity of the related asset or liability 
if the related liability is sold or otherwise liquidated  the instrument is marked to market  with the resultant gains and losses recognized in noninterest income 

next page the company has entered into interest rate swap agreements with the objective of economically hedging against the effects of changes in the fair value of its liabilities for fixed rate brokered certificates of deposit and subordinated debentures issued to capital trust caused by changes in market interest rates 
the swap agreements generally provide for the company to pay a variable rate of interest based on a spread to the one month or three month london interbank offering rate libor and to receive a fixed rate of interest equal to that of the hedged instrument 
under the swap agreements the company is to pay or receive interest monthly  quarterly  semiannually or at maturity 
at december   the notional amount of interest rate swaps outstanding was approximately million 
of this amount  million consisted of swaps in a net settlement receivable position and million consisted of swaps in a net settlement payable position 
at december   the notional amount of interest rate swaps outstanding was approximately million  all consisting of swaps in a receivable position 
the maturities of interest rate swaps outstanding at december  and  in terms of notional amounts and their average pay and receive rates is discussed further in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements
