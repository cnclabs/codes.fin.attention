item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read together with selected financial data  and our financial statements and accompanying notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements  based on current expectations and related to future events and our future financial performance  that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many important factors  including those set forth under item a  risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a therapeutic drug development company principally focused on the discovery  development and future commercialization of products that modulate key regulatory signaling pathways controlling the growth  repair and regeneration of human tissues and organs 
our product development approach involves using small molecules  proteins or antibodies to modulate these regulatory signaling pathways  for example  to increase the pathway signals when they are insufficient or to decrease them when they are excessive or unregulated 
we have successfully used our product development approach to produce multiple compounds with potential use for several different disease indications 
for example  we have developed a product candidate for the topical treatment of basal cell carcinoma  which is currently in a phase i clinical trial and under co development with genentech  a collaborator 
we have also developed several promising preclinical product candidates in various fields  including cancer  neurological disorders and hair growth regulation 
we operate in a single reportable segment developmental biology products 
we expect that any successful products would be used in the health care industry and would be regulated in the united states by the us food and drug administration  or fda  and in overseas markets by similar regulatory agencies 
since our inception  we have funded our operations primarily through license fees  research and development funding from our strategic collaborators  the private and public placement of our equity securities  debt financings and the monetization of certain royalty rights 
we have never been profitable and have incurred an accumulated deficit of  as of december  we expect to incur significant operating losses for the next several years as we devote substantially all of our resources to research and development of our product candidates 
we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve profitability and do not expect to achieve profitability in the foreseeable future  if at all 
our research programs are conducted both internally and through strategic collaborations 
we currently have strategic collaborations with genentech  procter gamble  and wyeth pharmaceuticals  or wyeth  to develop therapeutics  which modulate the signaling of the hedgehog pathway 
we have a second collaboration with genentech focusing on the discovery and development of small molecule modulators of another signaling pathway 
we have licensed our bone morphogenetic protein  or bmp  pathway patent portfolio to ortho biotech products  a subsidiary of johnson johnson  for systemic administration in all non orthopedic and non dental therapeutic applications 
this program is under development at centocor  another subsidiary of johnson johnson 
in  centocor entered into an agreement with us whereby centocor will fund a portion of a new curis bmp small molecule screening program 
lastly  a majority of our spinal muscular atrophy  or sma  research is funded through a sponsored research agreement with the sma foundation 
our current strategic collaborations and license agreements generally provide for our research  development and commercialization programs to be wholly or the majority funded by our collaborators and provide us with the opportunity to receive additional payments if specified milestones are achieved  as well as royalty payments upon the successful commercialization of any products based upon the collaboration 
these strategic license and collaboration agreements included  in up front payments  of which we received  from the sale of shares of our common stock  and also include approximately  in contingent cash payments 
table of contents that are tied to future clinical development and regulatory approval objectives  assuming that all of the collaborations continue for their full terms  multiple products for multiple indications are developed  and all milestone payments are received upon the successful completion of specified research and or development objectives and regulatory approvals 
in january  we exercised a co development option with genentech pursuant to which we are now sharing equally in the us development costs and will share equally in any future us net profits and or losses in this program 
through december   we had incurred  in co development costs under this program 
in the future  we plan to continue to seek corporate collaborators for the further development and commercialization of some of our other technologies 
in some cases  we have retained rights under such programs  including co development rights and development and commercialization rights in specific therapeutic areas where we believe we can attain additional value through the application of our own internal resources 
examples of retained rights within our programs under collaboration include co development rights for the development of a basal cell carcinoma product candidate under our hedgehog antagonist collaboration with genentech  as well as retained rights to our hedgehog agonist for topical applications  for local delivery in cardiovascular applications and for ex vivo use under our broad hedgehog agonist collaboration with wyeth 
restatement of financial statements as described in note of our consolidated financial statements  we have restated our financial results for and the restatement adjusts our consolidated balance sheet contained herein to correct amounts in prepaid expenses and other current assets  deposits and other assets  short term and long term deferred revenues  additional paid in capital  and accumulated deficit and to restate our consolidated and statements of operations to correct amounts reported in gross revenues and research and development expenses 
as a result of these restatements  amounts in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the years ended december  and have also been corrected 
these adjustments are more fully described below genentech license fee payments we had been recognizing revenue in connection with  in payments received from genentech as part of the june hedgehog antagonist collaboration between the parties over an eight year period based on our belief that our participation on the steering committees would become inconsequential after the first product was approved in each of the two programs covered under this collaboration  and would therefore no longer represent a performance obligation 
we have determined that we should not have recognized any of this revenue in  and instead  we will defer the  in payments and recognize this amount as revenue only when we can reasonably estimate when our contractual steering committee obligations will cease or after we no longer have contractual steering committee obligations under this agreement with genentech 
the contractual term of our steering committee obligations extends for as long as hedgehog antagonist products subject to this collaboration are being developed or commercialized by either of the parties 
accordingly  the contractual term of our steering committee obligations is indefinite and we expect that we will not record any revenue related to these payments for at least several years 
the consolidated financials statements for and have been restated to reverse all revenue recognized related to the amortization of this up front payment and to correct the related deferred revenue balances at december  and expenses due to university licensors we are restating previously reported research and development expenses associated with  in license fee payments that were payable by us to university licensors in connection with the june hedgehog antagonist collaboration with genentech 
we had previously capitalized this amount as prepaid expenses and other current assets and deposits and other assets in our consolidated balance sheets and amortized this amount to research and development expense as the related license fee revenue was recognized 
we have determined that we should have instead recognized the entire  immediately as research and development expense in june 
table of contents the consolidated financial statements for and have been restated to reverse the expense recorded in  to expense the entire payment of  in and to correct prepaid expenses and other current assets and deposits and other assets at december  to reflect the expensing of these payments 
correction of previously identified immaterial errors allocation of up front payments received from genentech and wyeth in connection with the restatement  we will also correct other previously identified immaterial errors which had previously been corrected through a cumulative adjustment to the consolidated financial statements in our quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended september  the restatement will allocate the adjustment among the correct periods 
these errors relate our sale of shares of our common stock in connection with the june genentech and january wyeth collaboration agreements 
in each case  we calculated the value of the common stock using the negotiated price  which was less than the closing market price on the agreement date 
because of this  we understated additional paid in capital and overstated deferred revenues by  the overstatement of deferred revenues resulted in an overstatement of license fee revenues in and because  in each case  we amortized deferred revenue over the estimated performance period to revenues in our consolidated statements of operations 
the consolidated financial statements for and have been restated to i reverse all revenue recognized related to the amortization of the deferred revenue related to the june genentech hedgehog antagonist collaboration  ii correct revenue recognized related to the amortization of the deferred revenue related to the wyeth collaboration  iii correct additional paid in capital at december  and  to reflect the fair value on the date of issuance of the common stock issued to genentech and wyeth and iv correct deferred revenue at december   to reflect the impact of these adjustments 
the correction of the accounting for the january wyeth collaboration agreement resulted in a  increase in net cash used in operating activities and a corresponding increase in net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  the correction of the accounting for the june genentech collaboration agreement resulted in a  increase in net cash used in operating activities and a corresponding increase in net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  as a result of this restatement  we have filed amendments no 
on forms q a to restate our march   june  and september  financial statements 
we do not anticipate filing amended annual reports on form k or quarterly reports on form q for any periods prior to the first quarter of accordingly  our annual reports on form k and our quarterly reports on form q from the second quarter of through fiscal have not been revised to reflect the restatement and the financial statements for fiscal and included in this annual report on form k should be relied upon 
management s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and our results of operations for the years ended december  and have been updated to reflect these restated amounts 
recent developments phase i basal cell carcinoma clinical trial update 
a phase i clinical trial of topically applied small molecule antagonist of the hedgehog signaling pathway is being conducted by genentech and curis 
the phase i clinical trial is a double blind  randomized  placebo controlled study that is expected to enroll approximately patients with a single or multiple basal cell carcinoma 
the primary objective of the phase i clinical trial is to obtain data about the safety and tolerability of a four week regimen of the drug candidate 
in addition  genentech and curis are evaluating the clinical activity of the drug candidate  where activity is defined as the complete eradication of the treated basal cell carcinoma lesion and is determined by clinical and microscopic examinations of the lesions 
at the conclusion of this phase i clinical trial  genentech and we plan to make a decision about whether to advance the drug candidate into a phase ii clinical trial 

table of contents on january   we provided an update on the phase i clinical trial 
at that time  of the phase i clinical trial patients had participated in a dose escalation segment  in which seven patients were randomized to receive treatment in one of four dose levels 
the dose escalation segment of the phase i clinical trial had recently been completed  and the preliminary data had been reviewed by an internal genentech data review board 
the preliminary data from the dose escalation segment suggested that the drug candidate appeared likely to be safe  well tolerated  and had shown signs of activity 
however  there had been less clinical activity observed to date than anticipated 
based on these data  the internal data review board recommended that genentech and we temporarily suspend further enrollment in the second segment of the trial  in which additional patients were to be treated at the highest dose level from the dose escalation segment 
genentech and we will determine whether to re open enrollment in this segment based on a secondary interim analysis that will occur at a later date 
the internal data review board also recommended that a third segment of the trial that is evaluating biological activity using a pharmacodynamic endpoint be enrolled as planned 
this third segment  among other things  may shed light on the extent to which the active compound in the drug candidate as formulated is penetrating the patients skin 
genentech and we expect to have final results from the phase i clinical trial during the first half of when the final results are obtained  genentech and we will determine whether this drug candidate should proceed to phase ii clinical trials 
should this drug candidate not progress into phase ii clinical trials  genentech and we will evaluate various criteria  including the data from the biological activity segment of the trial  and determine the alternatives for the basal cell carcinoma program 
possible scenarios include  but are not limited to the following extending the duration of the treatment regimen of the existing drug candidate  developing a new topical formulation of the existing drug candidate  selection of a new drug candidate  negotiation of the return of the compounds to us for our further development  or termination of the basal cell carcinoma drug program development 
preclinical milestone received from proctor gamble 
in march of  curis reached the first preclinical development objective in our hair growth program with procter gamble pharmaceuticals  a division of the procter gamble company 
the program is focused upon the potential development of a topical hedgehog agonist for hair growth disorders  such as male pattern baldness and female pattern hair loss 
as part of the initial agreement signed in september of  p g agreed to pay curis up to  in cash payments that are contingent upon the achievement of certain preclinical development objectives 
the first of two preclinical development objectives was successfully completed and resulted in a payment to curis of business summary was an important year for curis 
during  with our basal cell carcinoma program  we moved our first product candidate into clinical testing since genentech selected a lead candidate for clinical development under the systemic hedgehog antagonist program  and we entered into new corporate collaborations with genentech and procter gamble 
we also expanded our existing relationship with centocor and two of our collaborators  genentech and wyeth  extended their contractual commitments under their respective programs 
we believe that these extensions of these research collaborations demonstrate the contribution of our scientists to each of these programs 
the year was not without its challenges 
two of our product development programs experienced delays during  including our hedgehog agonist under collaboration with wyeth and our bmp protein product candidate under development with centocor 
the following provides additional information on key events in basal cell carcinoma product candidate to phase i clinical trial pursuant to the terms of our collaboration agreement with genentech  on january  we elected to exercise a co development option with genentech pursuant to which we are now sharing in the us development costs and will share equally in any future us net profits and or losses in this program 
as a result of participating in co development  we will forego us development milestone and royalty payments on potential future us sales of the basal cell carcinoma product candidate 
on june   we announced that the dosing of the first patient in the phase i clinical trial for basal cell carcinoma was completed 
this phase i trial 
table of contents is being conducted by genentech and curis 
as noted under recent developments above  on january   we provided an update on the progress of this phase i clinical trial 
new collaboration with genentech on april   we entered into a drug discovery collaboration agreement with genentech for discovery and development of small molecule compounds that modulate a signaling pathway that plays an important role in cell proliferation 
this pathway is a regulator of tissue growth  formation and repair  the abnormal activation of which is associated with certain cancers 
under the terms of the agreement  we granted genentech an exclusive  royalty bearing license to make  use and sell the small molecule compounds that are modulators of the pathway 
we have retained the rights for ex vivo cell therapy  except in the areas of oncology and hematopoiesis 
genentech paid us an up front license fee of  and has agreed to fund up to  for research activities during the initial two year research term  subject to certain termination rights 
genentech has also agreed to make cash payments to us that are contingent upon the successful achievement of certain preclinical and clinical development milestones and drug approval milestones 
excluding royalties on potential net product sales  the total potential cash payments from this collaboration could exceed  assuming that two products are commercialized in two indications each 
genentech will also pay us royalties on net product sales if product candidates derived from the collaboration are successfully developed 
genentech selects lead clinical candidate for the systemic hedgehog antagonist program on october   we announced that genentech selected a lead candidate  a small molecule antagonist of the hedgehog pathway  for the systemic treatment of solid tumor cancers 
other than our basal cell carcinoma program  this is our most advanced program 
we expect that genentech will file an ind relating to this program during the second half of genentech extends research funding for the systemic hedgehog antagonist program during  genentech elected twice to extend funding to support curis personnel dedicated to developing curis hedgehog antagonist technologies for the systemic treatment of solid tumor cancers for the period of june through june as part of these extensions  genentech committed to provide us with up to an additional  hedgehog agonist for hair growth collaboration with procter gamble in september  we announced that we had entered into an exclusive worldwide research and development agreement with procter gamble pharmaceuticals  a division of the procter gamble company  to evaluate and develop potential treatments for hair growth regulation utilizing our hedgehog agonist technology 
future efforts may be expanded to address other skin disorders 
under the terms of the agreement  we granted procter gamble an exclusive  worldwide royalty bearing license for the non systemic  dermatological use of our hedgehog agonist technology  via topical administration 
we will have an option to co develop a development candidate from investigational new drug application filing through phase ii clinical trials 
hedgehog agonist lead clinical candidate selection delayed on march   we announced that wyeth had paid us a preclinical milestone under our hedgehog agonist program 
the milestone was based on wyeth s and our continued progress in preclinical development of hedgehog pathway agonists for the treatment of stroke  neurological and other disorders 
we had anticipated that wyeth would select the drug candidate as a lead clinical development candidate in and that wyeth would file an ind in to begin human clinical testing in stroke 
under the collaboration  we have generated promising preclinical data demonstrating significant neuroprotection with a series of small molecule compounds  but to date we have not yet identified a compound to advance into clinical development 
we continue to work with wyeth towards achieving the objective of identifying and selecting a lead clinical candidate that meets both the efficacy and toxicity profiles required for clinical development 
the program is presently assessing the therapeutic efficacy and potential toxicity for a systemic therapy  particularly for stroke 
wyeth extends research funding of hedgehog agonist program in november  wyeth exercised its option under the agreement to extend funding to continue development of therapeutic 
table of contents applications of the hedgehog agonist with a primary focus on neurological disorders 
by exercising this option  wyeth agreed to extend the research term by one year through february  after the initial one year extension  the agreement may be extended for additional one year periods with our consent and upon recommendation of the steering committee with such full time equivalent resources and related wyeth funding obligations as may be consistent with fulfilling the objectives of the research plan 
bmp lead clinical candidate selection delayed in the second quarter  we adjusted our clinical timeline estimates related to our bmp program with johnson johnson 
earlier in  johnson johnson moved primary development responsibility of this program from ortho biotech products to centocor  another one of johnson johnson s subsidiaries 
under this new arrangement  curis and centocor expect to establish a cross company clinical team to share information on the development and progress of the bmp program 
we believe that the transfer of the bmp program to centocor was primarily to address specialized manufacturing requirements and complexities in relation to this protein 
with this transition of the bmp program  we are anticipating an ind filing no sooner than expansion of centocor relationship in december  we expanded our relationship with centocor 
under a new agreement  we will screen for small molecule agonists that mimic the bioactivity of bmp and activate the bone morphogenetic pathway 
the screening effort is expected to last fifteen months 
we will own any small molecule bmp agonist compounds that are discovered as part of this screening and centocor will have an exclusive option to first negotiate a new collaboration and exclusive license agreement for the development of the small molecules 
financial operations overview general 
our future operating results will largely depend on the magnitude of payments from our current and potential future corporate collaborators and the progress of other product candidates currently in our research and development pipeline 
the results of our operations will vary significantly from year to year and quarter to quarter and depend upon  among other factors  the timing of our entry into new collaborations  the timing of the receipt of payments from collaborators and the cost and outcome of clinical trials 
we believe that our existing capital resources at december   together with the payment of all contractually defined payments under our collaborations and research programs with genentech  wyeth  procter gamble and the sma foundation  assuming these programs continue as planned  should enable us to maintain current and planned operations into the second half of  including expected spending related to our co development of our lead product candidate for the treatment of basal cell carcinoma 
our ability to continue funding our planned operations beyond the second half of is dependent upon the success of our collaborations  our ability to control our cash burn rate and our ability to raise additional funds through equity  debt or other sources of financing 
a discussion of certain risks and uncertainties that could affect our liquidity  capital requirements and ability to raise additional funds is set forth under item a  risk factors 
revenue 
we do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products for several years  if ever 
substantially all of our gross revenues to date have been derived from license fees  research and development payments  milestone payments and other amounts that we have received from our strategic collaborators and licensees  including genentech  wyeth  ortho biotech products centocor  procter gamble and the sma foundation as well as royalty revenue and payments received upon monetization of certain royalty rights from stryker corporation  under the terms of which stryker paid us  in cash in in exchange for the termination of stryker s future royalty obligations 
since our equal share of the basal cell carcinoma co development costs will be recorded as a reduction to any revenue recognized under our collaborations with genentech in accordance with eitf  we do not expect to generate any net revenue from our two collaborations with genentech until we obtain fda approval to commercialize our basal cell carcinoma product candidate 
in the future  we will seek to generate revenues from a combination of license fees  research and development funding and milestone payments  royalties resulting from the sale of products that incorporate our intellectual property in connection with strategic licenses and collaborations  and sales of any products we successfully develop and commercialize  either alone or in collaboration with third parties 
we expect that any 
table of contents revenues we generate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the timing and amount of payments received under our strategic collaborations  and the amount and timing of payments we receive upon the sale of our products  to the extent that any are successfully commercialized 
research and development 
research and development expense consists of costs incurred to discover  research and develop our product candidates 
these expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel  supplies and reagents  outside service costs including medicinal chemistry  consulting and sponsored research collaborations  and occupancy and depreciation charges 
we expense research and development costs as incurred 
most of our programs are in various stages of preclinical drug development 
the following table summarizes our primary research and development programs  including the current development status of each program 
in the table  the term discovery means that we are searching for compounds that may be relevant for treating a particular disease area  early preclinical means we are seeking to obtain initial demonstrations of therapeutic efficacy in preclinical models of human disease  mid preclinical means we are seeking to obtain multiple demonstrations of efficacy in preclinical models of human disease  late preclinical means we are seeking to obtain both multiple demonstrations of efficacy in preclinical models of human disease and relevant toxicology and safety data required for an investigational new drug  or ind  application filing with the fda seeking to commence a phase i clinical trial to assess safety and tolerability in humans  and phase i means that we are currently treating human patients in a phase i clinical trial  the principal purpose of which is to evaluate safety of the compound being tested 
all of our estimates below regarding the status of our product development programs are solely our judgments 
these estimates may not reflect the beliefs or expectations of our corporate collaborators or licensors  if applicable 
moreover  because of the early stages of development of these programs  our ability and that of our collaborators and licensors to successfully complete preclinical or clinical studies of these product candidates  and the timing of completion of such programs  is highly uncertain

we currently expect that genentech will file an ind for this program in the second half of curis and wyeth are currently evaluating drug candidates in a particular class of agonist small molecule compounds 
this class of compounds is currently in a mid preclinical development status 
should the companies determine that this class of compounds will not generate a lead clinical development candidate  we expect that we will continue to seek a backup class of compounds 
our efforts to seek a backup class of compounds would initially be in discovery development 
we have incurred nominal expenses related to our cardiovascular disease program 
our preclinical data relating to this program has been primarily derived from studies conducted at caritas st 
elizabeth s medical center in boston  massachusetts 
wyeth has a right of first negotiation to obtain an exclusive license to the cardiovascular applications 
if wyeth declines to exercise its option  or if we are unable to reach an agreement with wyeth on terms within the contractually specified period  we are free to seek another collaborator for this program 
in the event that wyeth declines to exercise its option  we will actively explore other licensing opportunities for this program 
should we be successful in our efforts to license this program  either to wyeth or to another collaborator  any investigational new drug filing will likely be the responsibility of the collaborator 

table of contents there is a risk that any drug discovery and development program may not produce products or revenues 
due to uncertainties inherent in drug discovery and development  including those factors described under item a  risk factors  we and our collaborators may not be able to successfully develop and commercialize any of the product candidates included in the table above 
genentech and we are co developing a hedgehog small molecule antagonist formulated for the topical treatment of basal cell carcinoma 
genentech and we will share equally in all us development costs 
as a result of our election to exercise our co development option  we expect that we would incur approximately  in development costs through phase ii clinical trials and we anticipate that these trials will be completed in mid  assuming the successful advancement of the basal cell carcinoma product candidate through phase i and phase ii clinical trials 
we expect to incur additional costs to complete phase iii clinical trials and the remainder of the regulatory approval process  assuming that genentech and we successfully complete phase ii clinical trials 
due to the uncertainties that are inherent to the drug discovery process  as more fully described below  we are not currently able to estimate the cost and timing to complete the phase iii trial and receive regulatory approval of this product candidate  if ever 
except for our basal cell carcinoma product candidate  all of our product development initiatives are in various stages of preclinical testing 
because of the early stages of all of our programs  including our basal cell carcinoma program  the successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain 
we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature  timing and estimated costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of  or the period in which material net cash inflows are expected to commence from any of our product candidates due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing drugs  including the uncertainty of the scope  quality of data  rate of progress and cost of clinical trials and other research and development activities undertaken by us or our collaborators  the results of future clinical trials  the terms and timing of any collaborative  licensing and other arrangements that we may establish  the cost and timing of regulatory approvals  the cost and timing of establishing sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  the cost of establishing clinical and commercial supplies of our product candidates and any products that we may develop  the effect of competing technological and market developments  and the cost and effectiveness of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights 
any failure to complete the development of our product candidates in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our operations  financial position and liquidity 
a discussion of risks and uncertainties associated with completing our projects on schedule  or at all  and some consequences of failing to do so  are set forth in item a  risk factors 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and other related costs for personnel in executive  finance  accounting  business development  legal  information technology  corporate communications and human resource functions 
other costs include facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expense  insurance  and professional fees for legal  patent and accounting services 
within general and administrative expenses  we have recorded a  charge resulting from a reduction in our expected loss of subtenant income on an operating lease for the remainder of the lease term at our facility at moulton street  cambridge  ma 
this lease term ends on april  
table of contents strategic collaborations and license agreements 
since inception  substantially all of our revenues have been derived from collaborations and other research and development arrangements with third parties 
our current strategic collaborations and key license agreements are with genentech  wyeth  procter gamble and ortho biotech products 
these strategic license and collaboration agreements included  in up front payments  including  from the sale of shares of our common stock  and also include approximately  in contingent cash payments that are tied to future clinical development and regulatory approval objectives  assuming that all of the collaborations continue for their full terms  multiple products for multiple indications are successfully developed  and all milestone payments are received upon successful completion of specified research  development and regulatory approval objectives 
the collaborations and licenses are summarized as follows genentech hedgehog antagonist collaboration 
in june  we licensed our proprietary hedgehog pathway technologies to genentech for human therapeutic use 
the primary focus of the collaborative research plan has been to develop molecules that inhibit  or antagonize  the hedgehog pathway for the treatment of various cancers 
the collaboration consists of two programs the development of a small molecule hedgehog antagonist formulated for the topical treatment for basal cell carcinoma  and the development of systemically administered small molecule and antibody hedgehog antagonists for the treatment of certain other solid tumor cancers 
pursuant to the collaboration agreement  genentech agreed to make specified cash payments including up front payments of  which consisted of a  non refundable license fee payment and  in exchange for shares of the company s common stock 
genentech also agreed to make license maintenance fee payments totaling  over the first two years of the collaboration and contingent cash payments at various intervals during the clinical development and regulatory approval process of small molecule and antibody hedgehog antagonist product candidates  assuming specified clinical development and regulatory approval objectives are met 
in addition  genentech will pay us a royalty on potential future net product sales  which increases with increasing sales volume 
as described below  in december  we entered into an amendment to this agreement that modified the maintenance fee payment arrangement 
in january  pursuant to the collaboration agreement  we elected to exercise our co development option and are now sharing equally in the us development costs and will share in any future us net profits or losses of the basal cell carcinoma program 
as a result of participating in co development  we will forego us development contingent cash payments and royalty payments on potential future us sales of the basal cell carcinoma product candidate 
on june   we announced that the dosing of the first patient in the phase i clinical trial for basal cell carcinoma was completed 
this phase i trial is being conducted by genentech and curis 
in addition to our co development rights in the us marketplace  in certain major international markets  we will receive cash payments if specific clinical development objectives are achieved and a royalty on any international sales of a basal cell carcinoma product candidate 
under the systemic hedgehog antagonist program of the collaboration  genentech is obligated to make cash payments to us assuming the successful achievement of clinical development and drug approval objectives 
in addition  genentech will pay a royalty on potential future net product sales  which increases with increasing sales 
amendments to the genentech hedgehog antagonist collaboration 
in december and april  we entered into separate amendments to our june agreement with genentech 
we considered the provisions of eitf and determined that these agreements were separate contracts from our june agreement since these agreements were not contemplated at the time of the june arrangement  were separately negotiated in order to increase the number of full time equivalents providing research and development services and to provide xenograft tumor samples to genentech  and were not entered into at or near the time of the june agreement 

table of contents the december amendment  effective from june  to june   increased our commitment of full time equivalents providing research and development services for the systemic hedgehog antagonist program from eight to sixteen  including six full time equivalents that are employed by a third party but are managed by us  and increased genentech s funding commitment from  to  for this period of which genentech paid us  for research services in december and the remaining  for subsequent research services was paid in june pursuant to the agreement  we also agreed to provide xenograft tumor samples to genentech during the research period for which genentech paid us  in december also in accordance with the amendment  the second  maintenance payment due under the june arrangement was removed with no economic effect since it was replaced by a  payment for research services made to us in december the april amendment  effective from june  to june   provides for up to sixteen of our full time equivalent researchers  including six full time equivalents that are employed by a third party but are managed by us  to provide research and development services for the systemic hedgehog antagonist program for the period of june  until december   in exchange for an additional  which was paid in december the agreement also provided genentech with the option to request that we provide up to sixteen full time equivalent researchers to perform research services during the period of december  until june   provided that genentech supplies us with adequate notice 
in october  genentech requested that we provide ten full time equivalent researchers  all of which are curis employees  to work on the program from december  until june   in exchange for up to  the six full time third party equivalents that were previously involved in the program are no longer needed  based on the progress made under the program  which included the selection of a lead clinical candidate  a small molecule antagonist of the hedgehog pathway 
the remaining  for subsequent research services is payable by genentech in june genentech discovery research collaboration 
on april   we entered into a drug discovery collaboration agreement with genentech for discovery and development of small molecule compounds that modulate a signaling pathway that plays an important role in cell proliferation 
this pathway is a regulator of tissue growth  formation and repair  the abnormal activation of which is associated with certain cancers 
under the terms of the agreement  we granted genentech an exclusive  royalty bearing license to make  use and sell the small molecule compounds that are modulators of the pathway 
we have retained the rights for ex vivo cell therapy uses  except in the areas of oncology and hematopoiesis 
under the terms of the agreement  we have primary responsibility for drug discovery and research activities and genentech will be responsible for clinical development  manufacturing  and commercialization of products that may result from the collaboration 
genentech paid us an up front license fee of  and has agreed to fund up to  for research activities during the initial two year research term  subject to certain termination rights 
genentech has also agreed to make cash payments to us that are contingent upon the successful achievement of certain preclinical and clinical development and drug approval milestones 
excluding royalties on potential net product sales  the total potential cash payments from this collaboration could exceed  assuming that two products are commercialized in two indications each 
genentech has an option to extend the initial two year research term for up to two additional years in one year increments 
genentech will also pay us royalties on net product sales if product candidates derived from the collaboration are successfully developed 
wyeth hedgehog agonist collaboration 
on january   we licensed our hedgehog proteins and small molecule hedgehog pathway agonists to wyeth for therapeutic applications in the treatment of neurological and other disorders 
pursuant to the collaboration agreement  wyeth agreed to make specified cash payments  including up front payments of  which consisted of a  non refundable license fee payment and  in exchange for  shares of our common stock 
wyeth has agreed to assume all future responsibility for clinical development of the hedgehog small molecule and protein agonists as systemic treatments for neurological and other disorders 
wyeth is also obligated to make cash payments that are contingent upon the successful achievement of clinical 
table of contents development and drug approval objectives and to pay us a royalty on net product sales  if any should occur  that escalates with increasing sales volume 
our agreement with wyeth includes more than  in such contingent cash payments  assuming at least two products are successfully developed and commercialized 
in addition to these initial and potential future cash payments  wyeth is obligated to provide financial support of our research under the collaboration  at  per full time equivalent researcher  for a period of up two years based on the number of full time equivalent researchers performing services under the collaboration 
we are obligated to dedicate between five and ten full time equivalents to this program  as determined by the steering committee in six month intervals  for two years 
after the initial two year period  wyeth can  at its option  elect to extend our research obligation  and wyeth s funding thereof  for an initial one year extension on the same terms and conditions as the initial two year term 
in november  wyeth exercised this option to extend the initial term 
by exercising this option  wyeth agreed to extend the research term by one year through february  after the initial one year extension  the agreement may be extended for additional one year periods with our consent upon recommendation of the steering committee with such full time equivalent resources and related wyeth funding obligations as may be consistent with fulfilling the objectives of the research plan 
as part of the agreement  we have retained development and licensing options for certain therapeutic applications of the hedgehog agonist technologies  including topical treatment for skin diseases and disorders including hair growth regulation  ex vivo cell therapy  local delivery applications for treatment of cardiovascular disease  and those applications that qualify as orphan drug indications 
wyeth has a right of first negotiation to obtain an exclusive license to the orphan drug indications and the cardiovascular applications 
if wyeth declines to exercise its right  or if we are unable to reach an agreement with wyeth on terms within the contractually specified period  we are free to seek another collaborator for these programs 
procter gamble hedgehog agonist collaboration for hair growth and skin disorders 
on september   we entered into a collaboration  research and license agreement with procter gamble  to evaluate and develop potential treatments for hair growth regulation and skin disorders utilizing our hedgehog agonist technology 
under the terms of the agreement  we granted to procter gamble an exclusive  worldwide  royalty bearing license for the development and commercialization of topical dermatological and hair growth products that incorporate our hedgehog agonist technology 
in accordance with the terms of the agreement  the parties shall jointly undertake a research program with the goal of identifying one or more compounds to be developed and commercialized by procter gamble 
procter gamble is solely responsible for the cost of worldwide development and commercialization of any product candidates developed pursuant to the research program  provided however  that at the time that procter gamble determines to file the first ind application with the fda for a product candidate  we shall have the option  at our sole discretion  to co develop a product candidate through phases i and ii of clinical development 
we  however  would receive a higher royalty in the event that we exercise our co development option and subsequently share in development expenses through phase ii clinical trials 
should we elect to exercise this co development option  we will forego contingent cash payments that would otherwise be payable for the achievement of certain development objectives during the period from investigational new drug application filing through the completion of a phase ii clinical trial 
procter gamble has paid us an up front license fee of  and has agreed to fund up to  for two of our full time equivalent employees providing research and development activities during the initial one year research term  subject to its termination rights 
procter gamble has an option to extend the initial one year research term for up to three additional years in one year increments 
procter gamble has also agreed to make cash payments to us that are contingent upon the successful achievement of certain research  development  clinical and drug approval objectives 
procter gamble will also pay us royalties on net product sales if product candidates derived from the collaboration are successfully developed 

table of contents in march of  we reached the first preclinical development objective in our hair growth program with procter gamble pharmaceuticals  a division of the procter gamble company 
the program is focused upon the potential development of a topical hedgehog agonist for hair growth disorders  such as male pattern baldness and female pattern hair loss 
as part of the initial agreement signed in september of  p g agreed to pay curis up to  in cash payments that are contingent upon the achievement of certain preclinical development objectives 
the first of two preclinical development objectives was successfully completed and resulted in a payment to curis of  ortho biotech products bmp license 
in november  we entered into an agreement with ortho biotech products  a subsidiary of johnson johnson  pursuant to which ortho biotech obtained the license rights to our bmp technology and assumed control of the continued development of this product candidate 
in  johnson johnson moved responsibility for the further development of bmp to centocor  another subsidiary of johnson johnson  and centocor has assumed all future costs and responsibility for bmp based product development 
we are entitled to receive a series of contingent cash payments that are tied to the achievement of clinical development and regulatory objectives payments  and royalties on product sales if any bmp based products are successfully commercialized 
centocor has sole responsibility for deciding if and when human clinical trials of bmp will begin 
the transaction relates to all of our proprietary bmp compounds including bmp  which has been studied in animal models in various disease indications  including as a treatment for chronic kidney disease and systemic complications  such as renal osteodystrophy  a form of bone disease  and blood vessel complications that have been associated with chronic kidney disease 
use of our bmps for the repair or regeneration of local musculoskeletal tissue defects and dental defects is the subject of an exclusive agreement with stryker and is not included as part of this transaction 
pursuant to the agreement  ortho biotech paid us an up front payment of  in december  and has agreed to make contingent cash payments at various intervals during the us and european regulatory approval process assuming the first two therapeutic indications are successfully developed 
these contingent cash payments include a  payment if ortho biotech achieves us regulatory approval of a product for the treatment of kidney disease or associated complications 
the agreement further specifies that we will receive a royalty on net sales of products that incorporate our bmp technologies 
unless terminated earlier  the agreement shall remain in effect until the expiration of ortho biotech s obligation to pay royalties to us under the agreement 
centocor bmp agonist small molecule screening program 
in december  we expanded our relationship with centocor 
under a new agreement  we will screen for small molecule agonists that mimic the bioactivity of bmp and activate the bone morphogenetic pathway 
the screening effort is expected to last fifteen months 
we will own any small molecule bmp agonist compounds that are discovered as part of this screening and centocor will have an exclusive option to first negotiate a new collaboration and exclusive license agreement for the development of the small molecules 
spinal muscular atrophy program 
effective september   we entered into a sponsored research agreement with the spinal muscular atrophy  or sma  foundation 
under the agreement  the sma foundation will grant curis up to  over a three year period for the identification of therapeutic compounds to treat sma  a neurological disease that is the leading genetic cause of infant and toddler death 
the research will utilize our proprietary technologies and expertise to develop and refine assays in motor neurons and then use those assays to screen for potential drug candidates 
we will own any compounds that we generate under this collaboration and will also have the ability to bring any such compounds into the clinic  either using our own resources or with a collaborating third party 
if any drug candidates developed under the agreement are successfully commercialized  we will be required to make payments to the sma foundation if cumulative revenues from the sales of such products exceed  unless terminated earlier  the agreement will continue until the expiration of the research activities 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosure of certain assets and liabilities at our balance sheet date 
such estimates and judgments include the carrying value of property and equipment and intangible assets  revenue recognition  the value of certain liabilities and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in our consolidated financial statements  we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to understanding the judgments and estimates we use in preparing our financial statements revenue recognition 
our business strategy includes entering into collaborative license and development agreements with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies for the development and commercialization of our product candidates 
the terms of the agreements typically include non refundable license fees  funding of research and development  payments based upon achievement of clinical development milestones and royalties on product sales 
we follow the provisions of the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition  emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  eitf issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  and eitf issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products 
non refundable license fees are recognized as revenue when we have a contractual right to receive such payment  the contract price is fixed or determinable  the collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured and we have no further performance obligations under the license agreement 
multiple element arrangements  such as license and development arrangements are analyzed to determine whether the deliverables  which often include a license and performance obligations such as research and steering committee services  can be separated or whether they must be accounted for as a single unit of accounting in accordance with eitf we recognize up front license payments as revenue upon delivery of the license only if the license has stand alone value and the fair value of the undelivered performance obligations  typically including research and or steering committee services  can be determined 
if the fair value of the undelivered performance obligations can be determined  such obligations would then be accounted for separately as performed 
if the license is considered to either i not have stand alone value or ii have standalone value but the fair value of any of the undelivered performance obligations cannot be determined  the arrangement would then be accounted for as a single unit of accounting and the license payments and payments for performance obligations are recognized as revenue over the estimated period of when the performance obligations are performed 
whenever we determine that an arrangement should be accounted for as a single unit of accounting  we must determine the period over which the performance obligations will be performed and revenue will be recognized 
revenue will be recognized using either a relative performance or straight line method 
we recognize revenue using the relative performance method provided that we can reasonably estimate the level of effort required to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement and such performance obligations are provided on a best efforts basis 
direct labor hours or full time equivalents are typically used as the measure of performance 
revenue recognized under the relative performance method would be determined by multiplying the total payments under the contract  excluding royalties and payments contingent upon achievement of substantive milestones  by the ratio of level of effort incurred to date to estimated total level of effort required to complete our performance obligations under the arrangement 
revenue is limited to the lesser of the cumulative amount of payments received or the cumulative amount of revenue earned  as determined using the relative performance method  as of each reporting period 

table of contents if we cannot reasonably estimate the level of effort required to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement  the performance obligations are provided on a best efforts basis and we can reasonably estimate when the performance obligation ceases or becomes inconsequential  then the total payments under the arrangement  excluding royalties and payments contingent upon achievement of substantive milestones  would be recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the period we expect to complete our performance obligations 
revenue is limited to the lesser of the cumulative amount of payments received or the cumulative amount of revenue earned  as determined using the straight line basis  as of the period ending date 
if we cannot reasonably estimate when our performance obligation either ceases or becomes inconsequential  then revenue is deferred until we can reasonably estimate when the performance obligation ceases or becomes inconsequential 
significant management judgment is required in determining the level of effort required under an arrangement and the period over which we are expected to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement 
in addition  if we are involved in a steering committee as part of a multiple element arrangement that is accounted for as a single unit of accounting  we assess whether our involvement constitutes a performance obligation or a right to participate 
steering committee services that are not inconsequential or perfunctory and that are determined to be performance obligations are combined with other research services or performance obligations required under an arrangement  if any  in determining the level of effort required in an arrangement and the period over which we expect to complete our aggregate performance obligations 
collaboration agreements may also contain substantive milestone payments 
substantive milestone payments are considered to be performance bonuses that are recognized upon achievement of the milestone only if all of the following conditions are met the milestone payments are non refundable  achievement of the milestone involves a degree of risk and was not reasonably assured at the inception of the arrangement  substantive effort is involved in achieving the milestone  the amount of the milestone payment is reasonable in relation to the effort expended or the risk associated with achievement of the milestone  and  a reasonable amount of time passes between the up front license payment and the first milestone payment as well as between each subsequent milestone payment 
determination as to whether a payment meets the aforementioned conditions involves management s judgment 
if any of these conditions are not met  the resulting payment would not be considered a substantive milestone  and therefore the resulting payment would be considered part of the consideration for the single unit of accounting and be recognized as revenue as such performance obligations are performed under either the relative performance or straight line methods  as applicable  and in accordance with these policies as described above 
in addition  the determination that one such payment was not a substantive milestone would prevent us from concluding that subsequent milestone payments were substantive milestones and  as a result  any additional milestone payments would also be considered part of the consideration for the single unit of accounting and would be recognized as revenue as such performance obligations are performed under either the relative performance or straight line methods  as applicable 
reimbursement of costs is recognized as revenue provided the provisions of eitf are met  the amounts are determinable  and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
royalty revenue is recognized upon the sale of the related products  provided that the royalty amounts are fixed or determinable  collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured and we have no remaining performance obligations under the arrangement 
if royalties are received when we have remaining performance 
table of contents obligations  the royalty payments would be attributed to the services being provided under the arrangement and therefore would be recognized as such performance obligations are performed under either the relative performance or straight line methods  as applicable  and in accordance with these policies as described above 
for revenue generating arrangements where we  as a vendor  provide consideration to a licensor or collaborator  as a customer  we apply the provisions of eitf eitf addresses the accounting for revenue arrangements where both the vendor and the customer make cash payments to each other for services and or products 
a payment to a customer is presumed to be a reduction of the selling price unless we receive an identifiable benefit for the payment and we can reasonably estimate the fair value of the benefit received 
payments to a customer that are deemed a reduction of selling price are recorded first as a reduction of revenue  to the extent of both cumulative revenue recorded to date and of probable future revenues  which include any unamortized deferred revenue balances  under all arrangements with such customer and then as an expense 
payments that are not deemed to be a reduction of selling price would be recorded as an expense 
amounts received prior to satisfying the above revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
amounts not expected to be recognized during the twelve month period ended december  are classified as long term deferred revenue 
as of december   we have short term and long term deferred revenue of  and  respectively  related to our collaborations 
although we follow detailed guidelines in measuring revenue  certain judgments affect the application of our revenue policy 
for example  in connection with our existing collaboration agreements  we have recorded on our balance sheet short and long term deferred revenue based on our best estimate of when such revenue will be recognized 
short term deferred revenue consists of amounts that are expected to be recognized as revenue  or applied against future co development costs  by december  amounts that we expect will not be recognized prior to december  are classified as long term deferred revenue 
however  this estimate is based on our current operating plan as of december  if our operating plan should change in the future  we may recognize a different amount of deferred revenue over the twelve month period from january  through december  the estimate of deferred revenue also reflects management s estimate of the periods of our involvement in certain of our collaborations 
our performance obligations under these collaborations consist of participation on steering committees and the performance of other research and development services 
in certain instances  the timing of satisfying these obligations can be difficult to estimate 
accordingly  our estimates may change in the future 
such changes to estimates would result in a change in revenue recognition amounts 
if these estimates and judgments change over the course of these agreements  it may affect the timing and amount of revenue that we recognize and record in future periods 
stock based compensation 
we issue stock options to employees under our stock option and employee stock purchase plans 
these options are accounted for under apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations  including fasb interpretation no 
all stock based awards to non employees are accounted for at their fair value in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by financial accounting standards board  or fasb  interpretation no 
 and eitf issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees 
sfas requires that companies either recognize compensation expense for grants of stock options and other equity instruments based on fair value  or provide pro forma disclosure of net loss and net loss per share in the notes to the financial statements 
at december   we had two stock based compensation plans 
we account for these plans under the recognition and measurement principles of apb opinion no 
and related interpretations 
accordingly  no compensation cost has been recognized under sfas for our employee stock option plans 

table of contents under sfas no 
 the fair value of stock based awards to employees is calculated through the use of option pricing models  even though such models were developed to estimate the fair value of freely tradable  fully transferable options without vesting restrictions  which significantly differ from our stock option awards 
these models also require subjective assumptions  including risk free interest rates  future stock price volatility and expected time to exercise  which greatly affect the calculated values 
we calculate compensation cost with the black scholes option pricing model 
goodwill 
at december   we have recorded  in goodwill 
as a result of the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 goodwill and other intangibles  effective january   we ceased amortization of goodwill and have since performed at least annual assessments of goodwill impairment by comparing our fair value to our net assets 
sfas no 
requires us to perform an impairment assessment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that our goodwill may be impaired 
we completed our annual goodwill impairment tests in december  and  and determined that as of those dates our fair value exceeded the carrying value of our net assets 
accordingly  no goodwill impairment was recognized in  or long term receivables 
during the year ended december   we recorded  in other expense  charges of  related to the write off of previously recorded interest income and foreign exchange gains on a euro denominated note receivable that was originally due in june from micromet  a former collaborator to whom we had licensed technology  and  related to a reduction in the carrying value of micromet equity securities held by us 
we determined that this charge was necessary due to micromet s announcement that it was terminating one third of its workforce as the result of a contract dispute with a collaborator 
micromet had stated that this dispute would result in a significant decrease in previously budgeted cash inflows in we also wrote off the note receivable and reduced deferred revenue by  because we concluded that we were not reasonably assured of collecting the note 
on october   we amended our note receivable with micromet  and  under the amended note  micromet is obligated to pay us a total amount of eur  subject to certain conditions 
as a result of micromet s financing in october  we received a eur  payment in november  resulting in a gain of  based on the euro to us dollar foreign exchange rate on the date of payment 
the gain was recorded in other income as it related to a recovery of previously written off interest income and foreign exchange gains related to the note 
as a result of completing additional financings in  micromet made a second payment of eur  on october   which resulted in a gain of  based on the eur to us dollar foreign exchange rate on such date 
 of the gain was recorded as license fee revenue for the year ended december  because it represented the recovery of a previously written off note that we had received from micromet in exchange for the assignment of technology 
the remaining  was recorded in other income as it is related to a recovery of previously written off interest income and foreign exchange gains related to the note 
the future amounts due to us under the amended note are not considered reasonably assured of collection at december  and  therefore  have not been recorded as revenue 
we will record revenue when  and if  we conclude such amounts are reasonably assured of collection 
the above list is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result

this increase was mainly due to a  payment received from micromet  a former collaborator 
this increase was offset by  in contra revenue  or a reduction to gross revenues  related to our co development payments to genentech 
this reduction to gross revenue represents amounts owed for the reimbursement of our equal share of costs incurred by genentech under our collaboration related to the co development of a basal cell carcinoma therapeutic product candidate

in addition  stock based compensation expense decreased  during the year ended december  as compared to the prior year 
the decrease in stock based compensation was primarily attributable to a decrease of compensation expense recorded on options to purchase common stock that were issued to employees below fair market value on august  as of august   all of these options became fully vested  therefore  no related additional expense was recognized beyond august the decrease was also attributable to options issued to non employees that are marked to market liabilities 
as our stock price fluctuates  the liability and related expense either increases or decreases

the contract research component of this collaboration ended in december and  accordingly  we are no longer incurring costs related to this program 
in addition  costs related to our nervous system disorders program were significantly reduced as compared to these decreases were partially offset by increases in spending under our cancer program  which is under collaboration with genentech 
the increase in expenses was primarily attributable to a  increase in chemistry expenses related to potential small molecule antagonist product candidates for the treatment of various cancers as well as increases in license fees  personnel costs and related lab supplies partially offset by a  decrease in license fees charged to the program in as compared to genentech reimbursed us for all chemistry costs incurred under our collaboration for in addition  we initiated new discovery research programs in we incurred costs of  for our spinal muscular atrophy program  which is under collaboration with the sma foundation  and  in expenses related to our other discovery research programs during the year ended december  we incurred no expenses for these programs during the same period in

table of contents net loss applicable to common stockholders as a result of the foregoing  we incurred a net loss applicable to common stockholders of  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations primarily through license fees  research and development funding from our collaborators  the private and public placement of our equity securities  debt financings and the monetization of certain royalty rights 
at december   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities of  excluding restricted long term investments of  our cash and cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at date of purchase and consist of time deposits and investments in money market funds with commercial banks and financial institutions  short term commercial paper  and government obligations 
we also maintain cash balances with financial institutions in excess of insured limits 
we do not anticipate any losses with respect to such cash balances because the balances are invested in highly rated securities 
our marketable securities are investments with expected maturities of greater than three months  but less than twelve months  and consist of commercial paper  corporate debt securities  and government obligations 
the use of our cash flows for operations has primarily consisted of salaries and wages for our employees  facility and facility related costs for our office and laboratory  fees paid in connection with preclinical studies  laboratory supplies  consulting fees  and legal fees 
in addition  in we began incurring significant costs to fund the equal share of our co development expenses of our basal cell carcinoma product candidate  which is under development with genentech and is currently in a phase i clinical trial 
in  we recorded  in contra revenues at our consolidated statement of operations in connection with these co development costs 
to date  the source of our cash flows from operations has been payments received from our collaborators and licensors 
in general  our only source of cash flows from operations for the foreseeable future will be the up front license payments  if any  payments for the achievement of milestones  if any  and funded research and development that we may receive under collaboration agreements 
the timing of any new collaboration agreements and any payments under collaboration agreements cannot be easily predicted and may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
net cash used in operating activities was  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  cash used in operating activities during the year ended december  was primarily the result of our net loss for the period of  partially offset by non cash charges of  including depreciation  stock based compensation  and non cash interest expense 
in addition  increases in operating cash resulted from changes in certain current assets and liabilities during the year ended december   including the receipt of payments from our collaborators highlighted by the following payments a  license fee and approximately  in research funding from genentech associated with our april discovery research agreement   from genentech for our research and development services related to the development of hedgehog antagonist candidates   from wyeth for our research and development services related to the our broad hedgehog agonist collaboration  a  license fee and approximately  in research funding from procter gamble in connection with our september hedgehog agonist collaboration for hair growth regulation  and  received under our grant with the sma foundation 
in addition  we received  as a second payment on a previously written off note receivable from a former collaborator 
cash used in operating activities during the year ended december  was primarily to fund our net loss of  partially offset by  in non cash charges including stock based compensation expense  depreciation and amortization  non cash interest expense on notes payable  amortization of intangible assets  a gain on recovery of officers notes receivable relating to prior officers of a predecessor company and an 
table of contents impairment of an investment in micromet  a former collaborator of ours 
in addition  a  up front payment received for a licensing agreement with wyeth and a  maintenance fee payment received from genentech further offset our use of cash 
we expect to continue to use cash in operations as we continue to develop our products in clinical trials and advance new products into preclinical development 
in addition  in the future we may owe royalties and other contingent payments to our licensees based on the achievement of developmental milestones  product sales and specified other objectives 
we also expect that the increase in cash used will be partially offset by anticipated payments made under our collaborations with genentech  wyeth  procter gamble and the sma foundation  assuming these collaborations continue in accordance with their terms

as of december   there was approximately  including approximately  in accrued interest  outstanding under this convertible note payable 
on january   lan elected to convert the then outstanding balance of  into  shares of our common stock  based on a conversion price of per share 
we have no further obligations under this convertible note payable 
since august  we have sublet  of the  square fee of our facility at moulton street in cambridge  massachusetts 
under the terms of our sublease  as amended  we receive sublease payments that total approximately  per year 
in addition  we receive approximately  for facilities related services and also receive a pro rata portion of the moulton street facility overhead  including real estate taxes and utilities 
in july  our subtenant informed us that it was terminating approximately of its workforce and that it may encounter difficulties meeting its sublease obligations beyond december our lease obligation on our moulton street facility extends to april and our lease obligation from january to april is approximately  excluding real estate taxes and other operating costs 
should our current subtenant vacate the moulton facility  as expected  we will seek to sublet all or part of the facility 
there is no guarantee that we will be able to sublease the premises or that any sublease would be on terms that are similar to our current sublease 
accordingly  we have recorded a  charge to our general and administrative expenses within the costs and expenses section of our consolidated statements of operation for the year ended december  contractual obligations in addition to our loan agreement with boston private bank trust company  we also have contractual obligations including an operating lease related to our facilities  research services agreements  consulting agreements  and license agreements 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations due by the period indicated at december  amounts in s thereafter total convertible subordinated long term debt debt obligations under note payable operating lease obligations outside service obligations licensing obligations total future obligations obligations do not include amounts we will owe genentech under our co development arrangement 
assuming the successful advancement of the basal cell carcinoma product candidate through phase i and phase ii clinical trials  we expect that we will incur approximately  in development expenses 
table of contents and that the phase ii clinical trial will be completed in mid of this  we have incurred  through december  on january   we received notification from genentech that genentech believed that it had improperly invoiced curis for our share of basal cell carcinoma co development costs 
as a result of the invoicing errors  genentech notified curis that it believes that we owe genentech an incremental  for the reimbursement of costs that should have been charged by genentech to curis 
management believes that it is probable that we will owe genentech some portion of this amount and has estimated that our liability will range from  to  accordingly  we have recorded  as contra revenues from co development with genentech at our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  we have also recorded  within accrued liabilities at our consolidated balance sheet as of december  convertible subordinated debt is convertible into either shares of our common stock or cash at our option 
on january   we elected to convert the then outstanding balance of  into  shares of our common stock  based on a conversion price of per share 
we have no further obligations under this convertible note payable 
outside service obligations consist of agreements we have with outside labs  consultants and various other service organizations 
in the future  we may owe royalties and other contingent payments to our licensees based on the achievement of developmental milestones  product sales and specified other objectives 
these potential future obligations are not included in the above table 
we anticipate that existing capital resources at december   together with the payment of all contractually defined payments under our collaborations and research programs with genentech  wyeth  procter gamble and the sma foundation  assuming these contracts are not earlier terminated  should enable us to maintain current and planned operations into the second half of  including spending related to the co development of our basal cell carcinoma product candidate under development with genentech 
we expect to incur substantial additional research and development and other costs  including costs related to preclinical studies and clinical trials for the foreseeable future 
our ability to continue funding planned operations beyond the second half of is dependent upon the success of our collaborations  our ability to control our cash burn rate and our ability to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings  or from other sources of financing 
our ability to generate sufficient cash flows depends on a number of factors  including the ability of either us  or our collaborators  to obtain regulatory approval to market and commercialize products to treat indications in major commercial markets 
we are seeking additional collaborative arrangements and also expect to raise funds through one or more financing transactions  if conditions permit 
due to our significant long term capital requirements  we intend to seek to raise funds through the sale of debt or equity securities when conditions are favorable  even if we do not have an immediate need for additional capital at such time 
additional financing may not be available or  if available  it may not be available on favorable terms 
in addition  the sale of additional debt or equity securities could result in dilution to our stockholders 
if substantial additional funding is not available  our ability to fund research and development and other operations will be significantly affected and  accordingly  our business will be materially and adversely affected 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements as of december  inflation we believe that inflation has not had a significant impact on our revenue and results of operations since inception 

table of contents new accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r  which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options and share based payments granted to non employee members of a company s board of directors  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values using an option pricing model  such as the black scholes model  at the date of grant 
the pro forma footnote disclosure alternative is no longer allowable under sfas no 
r 
on march   the securities and exchange commission the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
to express the sec staff s views regarding the interaction between sfas no 
r and certain sec rules and regulations and provide the staff s views regarding the valuation of share based payment arrangements 
we are required to adopt sfas r in the first quarter of fiscal  beginning january  under sfas r  we must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at date of adoption 
we are expecting to elect to use the modified prospective method for adoption  which requires compensation expense to be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted shares beginning in the first quarter of adoption 
for all unvested options outstanding as of january   compensation expense previously measured under sfas no 
 but unrecognized  will be recognized using the straight line method over the remaining vesting period 
for share based payments granted subsequent to january   compensation expense  based on the fair value on the date of grant  as defined by sfas r  will be recognized using the straight line method from the date of grant over the service period of the employee receiving the award 
sfas r requires the estimation of forfeitures when recognizing compensation expense and that this estimate of forfeitures be adjusted over the requisite service period should actual forfeitures differ from such estimates 
changes in estimated forfeitures will be recognized through a cumulative catch up adjustment  which will be recognized in the period of change and which will impact the amount of unamortized compensation expense to be recognized in future periods 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  we recognized share based employee compensation expense for restricted stock awards and for stock issuances under our employee stock purchase plan 
no share based employee compensation cost for our stock option awards will have been reflected in net income prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r 
results for prior periods will not be restated 
we are evaluating the requirements of sfas r and expect that the adoption of sfas r will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and earnings per share 
in march  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations 
this is an interpretation of sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations which applies to all entities and addresses the legal obligations with the retirement of tangible long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development or normal operation of a long lived asset 
the sfas requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
interpretation no 
further clarifies what the term conditional asset retirement obligation means with respect to recording the asset retirement obligation discussed in sfas no 
the provisions of fin no 
are effective no later than december  we do not expect that the adoption of fin no 
will have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
on june   the fasb issued fasb statement no 
 accounting changes and error corrections fas  which will require entities that voluntarily make a change in accounting principle to apply that change retrospectively to prior periods financial statements  unless this would be impracticable 
fas supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  which previously required that most voluntary changes in accounting principle be recognized by including in the current period s net income the cumulative effect of 
table of contents changing to the new accounting principle 
fas also makes a distinction between retrospective application of an accounting principle and the restatement of financial statements to reflect the correction of an error 
another significant change in practice under fas will be that if an entity changes its method of depreciation  amortization  or depletion for long lived  non financial assets  the change must be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate 
under apb  such a change would have been reported as a change in accounting principle 
fas applies to accounting changes and error corrections that are made in fiscal years beginning after december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest our cash balances in excess of operating requirements in cash equivalents and short term marketable securities  generally money market funds  corporate debt and government securities with an average maturity of less than one year 
all marketable securities are considered available for sale 
the primary objective of our cash investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our invested cash without significantly increasing risk of loss 
our marketable securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
however  because of the short term nature of the marketable securities  we do not believe that interest rate fluctuations would materially impair the principal amount of our investments 
our investments are investment grade securities  and deposits are with investment grade financial institutions 
we believe that the realization of losses due to changes in credit spreads is unlikely as we have the ability to hold our investments for a sufficient period of time to recover the fair value of the investment and there is sufficient evidence to indicate that the fair value of the investment is recoverable 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we have operated primarily in the united states 
accordingly  we do not have any material exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations
